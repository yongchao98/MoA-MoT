    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule has one chiral center at carbon 5, with the (S) configuration. The structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone group (C=O) at carbon 3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The ketone at C3 is a prochiral center. The hydride ion (H-) can attack the carbonyl carbon from two different faces (re and si faces). This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3. Since the starting molecule already contains a chiral center at C5, the attack on the two faces is not equally probable, leading to the formation of two diastereomeric products. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The products are (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers of each other.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). Its structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. Since NaBH4 is in excess, both ketone groups will be reduced to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4. Since the starting material and the reagent (NaBH4) are both achiral, the reaction must produce an overall achiral mixture. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers of each other. Since the reaction is not stereospecific, they will be formed in equal amounts, resulting in a racemic mixture.\n    The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, which means it is a meso compound and is achiral. The (2S, 4R) isomer is the same meso compound.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The reaction produces three stereoisomers: the enantiomeric pair of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture with normal-phase HPLC.**\n\n*   **Combined Products:** The final mixture contains five compounds in total:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column has an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The enantiomers, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute as a **single peak**. The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it has different properties and will elute as a **separate peak**. This gives two peaks for the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C9H20O2) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2) and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined product mixture with chiral HPLC.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC Principle:** An HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase can differentiate between chiral molecules, including enantiomers, because they interact differently with the chiral environment.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, giving **two peaks**.\n    *   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II will all be separated from each other. The chiral column will resolve the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, into **two separate peaks**. The meso compound is achiral, but it is a diastereomer of the other two and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, eluting as its own **separate peak**. This gives three peaks for the products of Reaction II.\n    *   Again, the products from the two reactions are structurally distinct and will be separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 3 peaks (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
