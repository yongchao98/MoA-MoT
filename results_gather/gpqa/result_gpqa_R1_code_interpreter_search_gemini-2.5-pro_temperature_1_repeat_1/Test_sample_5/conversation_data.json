    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle.\n\n**1. Analyze the Potential**\n\nThe potential energy is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 * k * r^2 + 3/2 * k * r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n\nThe answer choices are given in terms of quantum numbers n_x and n_y, which suggests that the problem is simpler to solve in Cartesian coordinates (x, y). Therefore, the first step is to convert the potential from polar to Cartesian coordinates.\n\n**2. Convert Potential to Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\nx = r * cos(θ)\ny = r * sin(θ)\nr^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nFrom these, we can see that:\nr^2 * cos^2(θ) = (r * cos(θ))^2 = x^2\n\nNow, substitute these expressions into the potential V(r, θ):\nV(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * (x^2)\n\n**3. Simplify the Potential**\n\nCombine the terms involving x^2 and y^2:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 * k * x^2 + 3/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\nV(x, y) = 2 * k * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n**4. Identify the System**\n\nThe potential V(x, y) is the sum of two independent potentials, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\n*   V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2\n\nThis is the potential for a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Because the potential is separable, the total energy E of the system is the sum of the energies from the independent motions in the x and y directions:\nE = E_x + E_y\n\n**5. Find the Energy Spectrum for Each Dimension**\n\nThe energy levels for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form V(q) = 1/2 * m * ω^2 * q^2 are given by:\nE_n = (n + 1/2) * ħ * ω\n\n*   **For the x-dimension:**\n    The potential is V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2. We can write this as V_x(x) = 1/2 * (4k) * x^2.\n    Comparing this to the general form, we identify the effective spring constant as K_x = 4k.\n    The angular frequency for the x-motion is:\n    ω_x = sqrt(K_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n    The energy levels for the x-dimension are:\n    E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2) * ħ * ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) * ħ * (2 * sqrt(k / m))\n\n*   **For the y-dimension:**\n    The potential is V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2.\n    Comparing this to the general form, the effective spring constant is K_y = k.\n    The angular frequency for the y-motion is:\n    ω_y = sqrt(K_y / m) = sqrt(k / m)\n    The energy levels for the y-dimension are:\n    E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * ω_y = (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nNow, sum the energies for the two dimensions to find the total energy E:\nE = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\nE = (n_x + 1/2) * ħ * (2 * sqrt(k / m)) + (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\nFactor out the common term ħ * sqrt(k / m):\nE = [ (n_x + 1/2) * 2 + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n\nThe energy spectrum for the particle is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m). Comparing this with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
