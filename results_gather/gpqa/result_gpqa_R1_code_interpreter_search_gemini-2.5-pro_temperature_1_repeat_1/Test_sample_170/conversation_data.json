    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing yield of the para-monobromo derivative. The weight fraction of the yield is equivalent to the mole fraction (or mole percent) of the para-isomer in the product mixture, as all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) of a given starting material have the same molar mass.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\nWe need to classify each substituent on the benzene ring as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing. This property determines the primary positions of electrophilic attack.\n\n*   **Ortho,para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They are typically activating groups (like alkyls) or halogens.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Methyl): Activating, ortho,para-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chloro): Deactivating, ortho,para-director.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethyl): Activating, ortho,para-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are deactivating groups, typically containing a partial or full positive charge on the atom attached to the ring (e.g., due to a double or triple bond to a more electronegative atom).\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl carboxylate): Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (Carboxylic acid): Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**Step 3: Separate the Groups based on Directing Effect**\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce very small amounts of the para-isomer, while substances with ortho,para-directing groups will produce significant amounts. Therefore, the three meta-directing compounds will have the lowest para-yields.\n\nThe order will be: {compounds 2, 4, 6} < {compounds 1, 3, 5}.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Meta-Directing Compounds (4, 6, 2)**\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating/meta-directing effect. The stronger the group deactivates the ring and directs to the meta position, the lower the yield of the ortho and para isomers will be.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is well-established:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)\nThis gives the beginning of our sequence as: `4 < 6 < 2`.\n\n**Step 5: Order the Ortho,Para-Directing Compounds (1, 3, 5)**\nFor ortho,para-directors, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho product. The para position is generally favored over the ortho position due to less steric hindrance. This effect is more pronounced for larger substituents.\n\n*   **-CH3 (in Toluene, 1)**\n*   **-C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene, 5)**\n*   **-Cl (in Chlorobenzene, 3)**\n\nThe steric hindrance of the substituent increases in the order: -Cl < -CH3 < -C2H5.\nA simple steric argument would suggest that the preference for the para position, and thus the para-yield, should increase in the same order: Cl < CH3 < C2H5, which corresponds to `3 < 1 < 5`.\n\nHowever, electronic effects are also important. The strong inductive effect of chlorine deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position, which also increases para selectivity. Experimental data for bromination shows the following approximate para-isomer yields:\n*   Toluene (1): ~67%\n*   Chlorobenzene (3): ~87%\n*   Ethylbenzene (5): ~94%\n\nSo, the correct experimental order of increasing para-yield is: Toluene (1) < Chlorobenzene (3) < Ethylbenzene (5). This corresponds to the sequence `1 < 3 < 5`.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the Orders and Select the Best Option**\nCombining the order of the two groups:\n*   From meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   From ortho,para-directors (using experimental data): `1 < 3 < 5`\n\nThe full, chemically correct order is `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5`.\n\nNow let's compare this with the given options:\nA) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nNone of the options perfectly matches our derived order `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5`. This indicates a likely error in the question or options. However, we must choose the best fit.\n\nLet's analyze the options based on our most certain conclusions:\n1.  The order for meta-directors `4 < 6 < 2` is based on fundamental principles of electronic effects.\n2.  Only **Option A** starts with this correct sequence: `4<6<2...`.\n\nLet's examine the rest of Option A: `...1<5<3`. This implies the para-yield order for o,p-directors is Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene. This contradicts our experimental data, which shows Ethylbenzene has a higher para-yield than Chlorobenzene (`...1<3<5`).\n\nHowever, the error in the other options is more significant. For example, Option D suggests the order `4<2<6...`, which incorrectly states that ethyl benzoate gives less para-product than benzoic acid.\n\nGiven the choices, Option A is the most plausible answer because it correctly orders the meta-directing groups, which is a key part of the problem based on well-established chemical principles. The error in the latter part of the sequence is likely a flaw in the question's construction.\n\nFinal derived order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3** (as per Option A)\n\n<<<A>>>"
