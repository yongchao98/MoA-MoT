    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product and Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a derivative of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a delta-lactone, which is a six-membered cyclic ester. The structure has a chiral center at position 4, which bears an ethyl group. The two reactions produce enantiomers: `(R)` in reaction 1 and `(S)` in reaction 2. A delta-lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid (or a derivative like a 5-hydroxyester).\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options for starting materials A and B are enantiomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Let's deduce its structure.\n    *   The name suggests a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid).\n    *   `3-ethyl`: An ethyl group is at the C3 position.\n    *   `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` (3-ethylglutaric acid)\n    *   The name `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid` implies it's a mono-ester of this diacid. Let's assume the principal group is the carboxylic acid, and the other end is the isobutyl ester.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu` (where iBu = isobutyl, -CH2CH(CH3)2).\n    *   This molecule has a single chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group). The reactions start with either the (R) or (S) enantiomer of this compound.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reactions and Reagents**\n\nThe key to this problem lies in the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, `LiBH4` and `BH3`.\n\n*   **`LiBH4` (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent is a moderately strong reducing agent. It selectively reduces esters and ketones in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group is first deprotonated to form a carboxylate (`-COO-`), which is unreactive towards reduction by LiBH4.\n*   **`BH3` (Borane):** This reagent exhibits opposite selectivity. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but reduces esters much more slowly.\n\n### **3. Trace Reaction 1: A + LiBH4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** `LiBH4` will selectively reduce the ester group (`-CO-O-iBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) remains unchanged.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu`  --(`LiBH4`)-->  `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n    The intermediate is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** The acidic workup (`H+`) protonates the carboxylate and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid to form the six-membered delta-lactone.\n*   **Step 3: Stereochemistry.** The reactions (reduction of ester, lactonization) do not involve breaking any bonds at the C3 chiral center. However, the R/S designation can change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center changes.\n    *   **Starting Material (A):** The groups on the chiral center are H, Ethyl, `-CH2COOH`, and `-CH2COOR'`.\n        *   Priorities: `-CH2COOR'` (P1) > `-CH2COOH` (P2) > `-CH2CH3` (P3) > `-H` (P4). The ester group outranks the acid group because the isobutyl carbon beats the acid proton.\n    *   **Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid):** The `-CH2COOR'` group has become `-CH2CH2OH`. The groups are now H, Ethyl, `-CH2COOH`, and `-CH2CH2OH`.\n        *   Priorities: `-CH2COOH` (P1') > `-CH2CH2OH` (P2') > `-CH2CH3` (P3') > `-H` (P4').\n    *   **Analysis of Stereochemical Change:** The group that was P2 (`-CH2COOH`) is now P1'. The group that came from P1 (`-CH2COOR'`) is now P2' (`-CH2CH2OH`). The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in priority between two groups attached to a chiral center results in a flip of the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, if we start with an **(S)** starting material, the intermediate will be **(R)**. `(S)-A -> (R)-Intermediate`.\n    *   Lactonization of the (R)-intermediate does not change the stereocenter's configuration. So, `(R)-Intermediate -> (R)-Lactone`.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain the `(R)`-lactone, the starting material A must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\n### **4. Trace Reaction 2: B + BH3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** `BH3` will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The ester group (`-CO-O-iBu`) remains unchanged.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu`  --(`BH3`)-->  `HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu`\n    The intermediate is **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**.\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** The acidic workup (`H+`) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification to form the delta-lactone (releasing isobutanol).\n*   **Step 3: Stereochemistry.**\n    *   **Starting Material (B):** Same as A. Priorities: `-CH2COOR'` (P1) > `-CH2COOH` (P2) > `-CH2CH3` (P3).\n    *   **Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate):** The `-CH2COOH` group has become `-CH2CH2OH`. The groups are now H, Ethyl, `-CH2COOR'`, and `-CH2CH2OH`.\n        *   Priorities: `-CH2COOR'` (P1'') > `-CH2CH2OH` (P2'') > `-CH2CH3` (P3''). The ester group still outranks the new alcohol group.\n    *   **Analysis of Stereochemical Change:** The priority order of the groups (`-CH2COOR'` > `-CH2CH2OH` > `-CH2CH3`) is maintained relative to the starting material. Since the priority order does not change, the R/S designation does not change.\n    *   Therefore, if we start with an **(S)** starting material, the intermediate will also be **(S)**. `(S)-B -> (S)-Intermediate`.\n    *   Lactonization of the (S)-intermediate does not change the stereocenter's configuration. So, `(S)-Intermediate -> (S)-Lactone`.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** To obtain the `(S)`-lactone, the starting material B must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
