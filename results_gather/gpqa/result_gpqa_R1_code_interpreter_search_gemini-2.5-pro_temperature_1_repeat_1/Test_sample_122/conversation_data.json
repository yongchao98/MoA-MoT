    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The \"Galaxy reference frame\" (let's call it S) is the stationary frame.\n    *   The \"ejecta reference frame\" (let's call it S') is the moving frame.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the proper time.\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy reference frame (S). Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   The distance `d` is calculated in the Galaxy frame using the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame.\n    *   According to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for events occurring in a moving frame (the ejecta) than an observer in the moving frame (`Δt'`). This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The time dilation formula is `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio β = v/c.**\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor γ.**\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - β²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (Δt).**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    *   **Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame (d).**\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s]`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n\n    *   **Step 5: Compute the final numerical value.**\n        We can use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # velocity in km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # proper time in s\nc = 300000 # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (dt)\ndt = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(f\"{distance:.0f}\")\n```\n\nThe output of the code is:\n```\n3061862\n```\n\nThe calculated distance is 3,061,862 km. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) 2,880,000 km\nB) 3,060,000 km\nC) 2,940,000 km\nD) 3,000,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is extremely close to option B.

    "Here is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference and Given Information**\n\n*   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame of reference from which we want to measure the distance traveled.\n*   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The ejecta is moving relative to the Galaxy at `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt'):** The time measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's own clock) is `Δt' = 50 s`.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** The speed of light is a constant, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. Identify the Physical Principle**\n\nThe problem involves measurements across two different inertial frames moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. This requires using the principles of Special Relativity. Specifically, we need to account for **time dilation**.\n\nAn observer in the Galaxy frame (S) will measure time passing more slowly for the moving ejecta. Therefore, the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (`Δt`) will be longer than the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (`Δt'`).\n\n**3. The Formulas**\n\n*   The distance `d` traveled in the Galaxy frame is given by: `d = v * Δt`\n*   The time dilation formula relates the time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) to the proper time in the moving frame (`Δt'`): `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n*   The Lorentz factor `γ` (gamma) is calculated as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio v/c (beta, β).**\n    `β = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - β²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (Δt).**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame (d).**\n    `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s]`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n\n*   **Step 5: Compute the final value.**\n    Using the code-calculated value, `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated distance is 3,061,862 km. Comparing this to the options:\nA) 2,880,000 km\nB) 3,060,000 km\nC) 2,940,000 km\nD) 3,000,000 km\n\nThe value 3,061,862 km is closest to option B, 3,060,000 km. The small difference is due to rounding in the question's options.\n\n<<<B>>>"
