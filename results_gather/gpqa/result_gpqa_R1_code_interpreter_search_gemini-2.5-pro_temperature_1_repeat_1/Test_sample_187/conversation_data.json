    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Crystal System and Given Parameters:**\n    *   The crystal is rhombohedral.\n    *   In a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are `a = b = c` and the interaxial angles are `α = β = γ`.\n    *   The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom, which corresponds to the lattice constant `a`. So, `a = 10 Å`.\n    *   The angles are given as `α = β = γ = 30°`.\n    *   We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane, so `h = 1`, `k = 1`, `l = 1`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Interplanar Distance in a Rhombohedral Crystal:**\n    The general formula for the interplanar distance `d_hkl` in a rhombohedral crystal is given by:\n    `1/d_hkl^2 = [ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)sin^2(α) + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos^2(α) - cos(α)) ] / [ a^2(1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α)) ]`\n\n3.  **Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane:**\n    For the (111) plane, we have `h = 1`, `k = 1`, `l = 1`. Let's substitute these values into the formula:\n    *   `h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3`\n    *   `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\n    Substituting these into the formula gives:\n    `1/d_111^2 = [ 3*sin^2(α) + 2(3)(cos^2(α) - cos(α)) ] / [ a^2(1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α)) ]`\n    `1/d_111^2 = [ 3*sin^2(α) + 6*cos^2(α) - 6*cos(α) ] / [ a^2(1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α)) ]`\n\n    Now, let's simplify the numerator and denominator.\n    *   **Numerator:**\n        `3*sin^2(α) + 6*cos^2(α) - 6*cos(α)`\n        `= 3*(sin^2(α) + cos^2(α)) + 3*cos^2(α) - 6*cos(α)`\n        `= 3*(1) + 3*cos^2(α) - 6*cos(α)`\n        `= 3(1 - 2*cos(α) + cos^2(α))`\n        `= 3(1 - cos(α))^2`\n\n    *   **Denominator:**\n        The volume term in the denominator can be factored:\n        `1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α) = (1 - cos(α))^2 * (1 + 2cos(α))`\n\n    Now, substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the equation:\n    `1/d_111^2 = [ 3(1 - cos(α))^2 ] / [ a^2 * (1 - cos(α))^2 * (1 + 2cos(α)) ]`\n\n    The `(1 - cos(α))^2` term cancels out, leaving a much simpler formula:\n    `1/d_111^2 = 3 / [ a^2 * (1 + 2cos(α)) ]`\n\n    Inverting this gives the formula for `d_111`:\n    `d_111^2 = [ a^2 * (1 + 2cos(α)) ] / 3`\n    `d_111 = a * sqrt( (1 + 2cos(α)) / 3 )`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Interplanar Distance:**\n    Now, we plug in the given values: `a = 10 Å` and `α = 30°`.\n    *   `cos(30°) = sqrt(3) / 2`\n\n    `d_111 = 10 * sqrt( (1 + 2 * (sqrt(3) / 2)) / 3 )`\n    `d_111 = 10 * sqrt( (1 + sqrt(3)) / 3 )`\n\n    To get the numerical value, we can use a Python script for precision.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\na = 10.0  # Angstrom\nalpha_deg = 30.0\n\n# Simplified formula for d_111\n# d_111 = a * sqrt((1 + 2*cos(alpha)) / 3)\n\n# Convert angle to radians\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n# Calculate cos(alpha)\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\n\n# Calculate the term inside the square root\nterm = (1 + 2 * cos_alpha) / 3\n\n# Calculate d_111\nd_111 = a * math.sqrt(term)\n\nprint(d_111)\n```\n<execute_code>\n9.542974367988344\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculated value is approximately `9.54 Å`.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 10.05 Angstrom\n    *   B) 8.95 Angstrom\n    *   C) 9.54 Angstrom\n    *   D) 9.08 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated result `9.54 Å` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the interplanar distance `d_hkl` for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n**1. Identify the given parameters:**\n*   Crystal system: Rhombohedral\n*   Lattice parameter, `a` = 10 Angstrom\n*   Interaxial angles, `α = β = γ` = 30°\n*   Miller indices, `(hkl)` = (111)\n\n**2. State the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system:**\nThe formula for the interplanar spacing `d_hkl` in a rhombohedral crystal is given by:\n`1/d_hkl^2 = [ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)sin^2(α) + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos^2(α) - cos(α)) ] / [ a^2(1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α)) ]`\n\n**3. Simplify the formula for the (111) plane:**\nFor the (111) plane, `h = 1`, `k = 1`, `l = 1`.\n*   `h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\nSubstituting these values into the general formula gives:\n`1/d_111^2 = [ 3sin^2(α) + 2(3)(cos^2(α) - cos(α)) ] / [ a^2(1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α)) ]`\n\nThe expression can be simplified. The numerator becomes `3(1-cos(α))^2` and the denominator's volume factor `(1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α))` simplifies to `(1-cos(α))^2 * (1+2cos(α))`.\n\nAfter cancellation, the formula for the (111) plane becomes much simpler:\n`1/d_111^2 = 3 / [ a^2 * (1 + 2cos(α)) ]`\n\nRearranging to solve for `d_111`:\n`d_111^2 = [ a^2 * (1 + 2cos(α)) ] / 3`\n`d_111 = a * sqrt( (1 + 2cos(α)) / 3 )`\n\n**4. Calculate the value:**\nNow, we substitute the given values `a = 10` Å and `α = 30°` into the simplified formula.\n*   `cos(30°) = sqrt(3) / 2 ≈ 0.866`\n\n`d_111 = 10 * sqrt( (1 + 2 * cos(30°)) / 3 )`\n`d_111 = 10 * sqrt( (1 + 2 * (sqrt(3)/2)) / 3 )`\n`d_111 = 10 * sqrt( (1 + sqrt(3)) / 3 )`\n\nUsing the numerical value from the code execution:\n`d_111 ≈ 9.54297` Angstrom.\n\n**5. Compare with the options:**\nThe calculated value is approximately 9.54 Angstrom.\n*   A) 10.05 Angstrom\n*   B) 8.95 Angstrom\n*   C) 9.54 Angstrom\n*   D) 9.08 Angstrom\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
