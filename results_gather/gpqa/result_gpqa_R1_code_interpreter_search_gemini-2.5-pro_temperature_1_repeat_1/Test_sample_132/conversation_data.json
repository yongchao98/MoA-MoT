    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻) in the final solution.\n\n2.  **Identify the Chemical Species:**\n    *   The solution is made by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O) in water.\n    *   KH₂PO₄ dissociates completely in water to form K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate) ions.\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O dissociates completely to form 2 Na⁺, HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate) ions, and water molecules.\n    *   The key species for the acid-base chemistry are H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. These form a buffer system.\n\n3.  **Phosphoric Acid Equilibria:**\n    Phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) is a triprotic acid with three dissociation steps:\n    *   (1) H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻ ; Ka₁ = 7.5 x 10⁻³\n    *   (2) H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ ; Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸\n    *   (3) HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ ; Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²\n    The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is produced in the third dissociation step.\n\n4.  **Calculate Initial Concentrations:**\n    First, we need to calculate the molar concentrations of the buffer components, H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.\n    *   Volume of solution (V) = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L.\n    *   Mass of KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 g (Molar Mass = 136.09 g/mol).\n    *   Mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 1.00 g (Molar Mass = 177.99 g/mol).\n\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = Moles of KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol\n\n    *   Concentration [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles / Volume = (1.00 / 136.09) mol / 0.20000 L\n    *   Concentration [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles / Volume = (1.00 / 177.99) mol / 0.20000 L\n\n5.  **Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:**\n    The H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ pair acts as a buffer. The pH (and thus [H⁺]) of the solution is controlled by the second dissociation equilibrium (Ka₂).\n    *   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    Since both concentrations are in the same volume, we can use the ratio of moles:\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * (moles of H₂PO₄⁻ / moles of HPO₄²⁻)\n    The dissociation and association of the buffer components are minimal, so we can use their initial concentrations for this calculation.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    The concentration of PO₄³⁻ is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium (Ka₃), which involves the HPO₄²⁻ ion.\n    *   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    We use the [H⁺] calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] (since its dissociation is very small, as indicated by the tiny Ka₃ value).\n\n7.  **Computation:**\n    Now, let's perform the calculations using a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Data ---\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.20000  # L\n\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate initial concentrations ---\nmoles_H2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nconc_H2PO4 = moles_H2PO4 / volume_L\n\nmoles_HPO4 = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconc_HPO4 = moles_HPO4 / volume_L\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate [H+] from the buffer equilibrium ---\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4 / conc_HPO4)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate [PO4^3-] from the third dissociation ---\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nconc_PO4 = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4 / conc_H_plus)\n\nprint(f\"Concentration of H2PO4- = {conc_H2PO4:.5f} M\")\nprint(f\"Concentration of HPO4^2- = {conc_HPO4:.5f} M\")\nprint(f\"Concentration of H+ = {conc_H_plus:.3e} M\")\nprint(f\"Concentration of PO4^3- = {conc_PO4:.3e} M\")\n```\n>>>\nConcentration of H2PO4- = 0.03674 M\nConcentration of HPO4^2- = 0.02809 M\nConcentration of H+ = 8.113e-08 M\nConcentration of PO4^3- = 6.237e-07 M\n<<<\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) is 6.237 x 10⁻⁷ M. This value corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) is 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M. This value is closest to option A.\n\nThe detailed step-by-step derivation is as follows:\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each substance:**\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components:**\n    The solution volume is 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L.\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\n    The H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ pair forms a buffer governed by the Ka₂ equilibrium:\n    H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ ; Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸\n    Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation framework:\n    Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    The concentration of PO₄³⁻ is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium, which is governed by Ka₃:\n    HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ ; Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²\n    Rearranging the equilibrium expression to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n    Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nComparing this calculated value to the given options:\n*   A) 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n*   B) 3.97 x 10⁻⁷ M\n*   C) 2.81 x 10⁻⁷ M\n*   D) 5.48 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value of 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M is essentially identical to 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M (the difference is due to rounding).\n\n<<<A>>>"
