    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the limiting magnitude for ESPRESSO.**\n\nThe problem defines a star as \"detectable\" if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel is achieved in a 1-hour exposure.\n\nFirst, we need to find the performance specifications for ESPRESSO. The provided link (https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html) states: \"A signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 per pixel at 550 nm is reached for a G2V star with V=16.5 mag in a 10-minute exposure.\"\n\nLet's use this information to calculate the limiting magnitude for a 1-hour exposure.\n\n*   Known performance: V₁ = 16.5 mag for S/N = 10 in t₁ = 10 minutes.\n*   Required performance: S/N = 10 in t₂ = 1 hour = 60 minutes. We need to find the corresponding magnitude, V₂.\n\nThe signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is proportional to the square root of the total number of photons collected. The number of photons is proportional to the star's flux (F) and the exposure time (t).\nS/N ∝ √(F × t)\n\nTo keep the S/N constant at 10, the product of flux and time must be the same in both scenarios:\nF₁ × t₁ = F₂ × t₂\nF₂ / F₁ = t₁ / t₂ = 10 min / 60 min = 1/6\n\nThe relationship between apparent magnitude (V) and flux (F) is given by:\nV₂ - V₁ = -2.5 log₁₀(F₂ / F₁)\n\nNow we can substitute the flux ratio to find the new limiting magnitude V₂:\nV₂ - 16.5 = -2.5 log₁₀(1/6)\nV₂ = 16.5 + 2.5 log₁₀(6)\nV₂ ≈ 16.5 + 2.5 × 0.778\nV₂ ≈ 16.5 + 1.945\nV₂ ≈ 18.445 mag\n\nSo, a star is detectable if its apparent V magnitude is less than or equal to approximately 18.45.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate each star for detectability.**\n\nA star must satisfy two conditions to be detectable:\n1.  It must be visible from the Paranal Observatory (Latitude ≈ -24.6° S).\n2.  Its apparent V magnitude (mᵥ) must be ≤ 18.45.\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Visibility:** Canopus has a declination of -52° 41'. As a southern star, it is perfectly visible from Paranal in Chile.\n*   **Brightness:** Its apparent magnitude is mᵥ = -0.74.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since -0.74 ≤ 18.45, Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Visibility:** Polaris has a declination of +89° 15'. It is the North Star. Paranal is in the Southern Hemisphere at latitude -24.6°. Polaris is always below the horizon and is therefore not visible from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Polaris is **not detectable**.\n\nFor stars c, d, e, and f, we first need to calculate their apparent magnitudes (mᵥ) from their absolute magnitudes (Mᵥ) and distances (d). The formula is the distance modulus:\nmᵥ - Mᵥ = 5 log₁₀(d/10)  (where d is in parsecs)\nGiven Mᵥ = 15 for all four stars.\nmᵥ = 15 + 5 log₁₀(d/10)\nAll these stars have a declination of 0°, which means they lie on the celestial equator and are visible from Paranal.\n\n**c) Star with d = 10 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** DEC = 0°, so it is visible.\n*   **Brightness:** mᵥ = 15 + 5 log₁₀(10/10) = 15 + 5 log₁₀(1) = 15.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since 15 ≤ 18.45, this star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with d = 200 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** DEC = 0°, so it is visible.\n*   **Brightness:** mᵥ = 15 + 5 log₁₀(200/10) = 15 + 5 log₁₀(20) ≈ 15 + 5 × 1.301 = 15 + 6.505 = 21.505.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since 21.505 > 18.45, this star is **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with d = 5 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** DEC = 0°, so it is visible.\n*   **Brightness:** mᵥ = 15 + 5 log₁₀(5/10) = 15 + 5 log₁₀(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5 × (-0.301) = 15 - 1.505 = 13.495.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since 13.495 ≤ 18.45, this star is **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with d = 50 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** DEC = 0°, so it is visible.\n*   **Brightness:** mᵥ = 15 + 5 log₁₀(50/10) = 15 + 5 log₁₀(5) ≈ 15 + 5 × 0.699 = 15 + 3.495 = 18.495.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since 18.495 > 18.45, this star is just slightly too faint and is therefore **not detectable**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   a) Canopus: Detectable\n*   b) Polaris: Not Detectable\n*   c) Star (10 pc): Detectable\n*   d) Star (200 pc): Not Detectable\n*   e) Star (5 pc): Detectable\n*   f) Star (50 pc): Not Detectable\n\nThe detectable stars are (a), (c), and (e). In total, 3 stars are detectable.\n\n<<<C>>>"
