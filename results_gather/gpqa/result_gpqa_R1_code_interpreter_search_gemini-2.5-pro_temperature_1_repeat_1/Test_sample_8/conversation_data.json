    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which molecule has C3h symmetry.\n\n### **1. Understand C3h Symmetry**\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it has the following symmetry elements:\n*   A **principal C3 axis** of rotation (rotation by 360/3 = 120° leaves the molecule unchanged).\n*   A **horizontal mirror plane (σh)** that is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\nThe C3h point group also implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis, but the presence of C3 and σh is sufficient for our analysis. A molecule whose point group is a supergroup of C3h (e.g., D3h) also possesses C3h symmetry.\n\n### **2. Analyze Each Molecule**\n\nLet's examine the structure and symmetry of each option.\n\n**A) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n*   **Structure:** It has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The B and the three oxygen atoms prefer a trigonal planar arrangement (the BO3 core).\n*   **Symmetry:** Due to the steric bulk of the three isopropyl groups, they cannot all lie flat in the same plane. To minimize steric repulsion, they twist out of the BO3 plane in a concerted, propeller-like fashion.\n*   **Point Group:** This propeller conformation has a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane. However, it lacks any mirror planes, including a horizontal one (σh), because reflecting across the BO3 plane would not result in an identical molecule. Therefore, its point group is **C3**. It does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n**D) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n*   **Structure:** This is a rigid, bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure. It has a nitrogen atom and a CH group at opposite bridgehead positions.\n*   **Symmetry:** There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon and hydrogen. There are also three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain this C3 axis and one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **Point Group:** The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group. It does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n\n**C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule consists of a triphenylene core with three anhydride groups fused to its \"bay\" regions. Triphenylene itself is a large, planar aromatic system.\n*   **Symmetry:** While one might expect this large fused system to be planar, there is significant steric hindrance between the carbonyl groups of the adjacent anhydride rings. This strain forces the molecule to distort from planarity, twisting into a non-planar, helical, propeller-like shape.\n*   **Point Group:** This twisted structure loses its horizontal mirror plane (σh). It retains the C3 axis and three C2 axes perpendicular to it. Its point group is **D3**. It does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n**B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule, also known as mellitic trianhydride, consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to it.\n*   **Symmetry:** Unlike the larger triphenylene derivative, this molecule is small enough that it can maintain a perfectly planar structure.\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   Because the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n*   **Point Group:** The presence of both a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane means the molecule has at least C3h symmetry. In fact, it also has three C2 axes lying within the plane, making its full point group **D3h**. Since the D3h group contains all the symmetry elements of the C3h group, this molecule possesses C3h symmetry.\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\nComparing the point groups of the four molecules:\n*   A) Triisopropyl borate: **C3** (lacks σh)\n*   B) Benzo[...]hexaone: **D3h** (has C3 and σh)\n*   C) Triphenyleno[...]hexaone: **D3** (lacks σh)\n*   D) Quinuclidine: **C3v** (lacks σh)\n\nOnly molecule B has both a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
