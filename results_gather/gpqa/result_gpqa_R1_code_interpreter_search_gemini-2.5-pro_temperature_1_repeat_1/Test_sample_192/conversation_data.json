    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx⁵. This is a statement about the number density of stars with respect to parallax. In mathematical terms, if N is the number of stars, this relationship describes how the number of stars dN in a small parallax interval d(plx) changes. We can write this as a proportionality:\n    dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵\n    or\n    dN ∝ plx⁻⁵ d(plx)\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). This corresponds to the quantity dN/dr. We need to find the proportionality of dN/dr as a function of r.\n\n3.  **Establish the Fundamental Relationship between Distance and Parallax:**\n    The parallax of a star (plx) is inversely proportional to its distance (r). The standard definition is:\n    plx = 1/r\n    This also means that:\n    r = 1/plx\n\n4.  **Relate the Differentials:**\n    To convert the expression from being in terms of parallax to being in terms of distance, we need to find the relationship between the small interval d(plx) and the small interval dr. We can do this by taking the derivative of the parallax-distance relation.\n    plx = r⁻¹\n    Differentiating plx with respect to r gives:\n    d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n    Rearranging this gives:\n    d(plx) = (-1/r²) dr\n    When considering the number of stars in an interval, we are interested in the magnitude of the interval, not its sign. The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (r) increases, parallax (plx) decreases. So, we can use the magnitude:\n    |d(plx)| = (1/r²) dr\n\n5.  **Perform the Substitution:**\n    Now we substitute the expressions for plx and d(plx) in terms of r into our original proportionality.\n    Original proportionality: dN ∝ plx⁻⁵ d(plx)\n    Substitute plx = 1/r:\n    dN ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵ d(plx)\n    dN ∝ r⁵ d(plx)\n    Now substitute d(plx) = (1/r²) dr:\n    dN ∝ r⁵ * (1/r²) dr\n    dN ∝ r⁵⁻² dr\n    dN ∝ r³ dr\n\n6.  **Find the Final Proportionality:**\n    The expression dN ∝ r³ dr tells us how the number of stars (dN) in a small distance shell (dr) depends on the distance (r). The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of distance, which is dN/dr. From our derived expression, we can see:\n    dN/dr ∝ r³\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance varies as the cube of the distance (r³). Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) ~ r⁵\n    B) ~ r⁴\n    C) ~ r²\n    D) ~ r³\n\n    Our result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
