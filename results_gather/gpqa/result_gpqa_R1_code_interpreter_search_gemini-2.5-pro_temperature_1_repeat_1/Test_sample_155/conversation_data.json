    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the HPLC analysis.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n      CH3CH2CH2   H\n               \\ /\n                C=C\n               / \\\n              H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition (the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond).\n    *   A mnemonic for stereochemistry is that a *trans*-alkene undergoing *syn*-addition results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   The product is a trans-epoxide. For a symmetrically substituted alkene like oct-4-ene, this results in a pair of enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Ring-opening with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** The acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide by a nucleophile (H₂O in this case) proceeds via an Sₙ2-like mechanism. The water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond. This is an *anti*-attack.\n    *   The overall reaction from alkene to diol is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The stereochemical mnemonic for this is: **(E)-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound**.\n    *   Let's verify this through the mechanism: The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-epoxides reacts with water.\n        *   (4R,5R)-epoxide + H₂O (anti-attack) → (4R,5S)-diol (a meso compound). Attack at C4 inverts it to S, attack at C5 inverts it to S. Wait, let's re-verify. Attack at C4 (R) inverts its configuration to S, while C5 remains R, yielding (4S,5R)-diol. Attack at C5 (R) inverts its configuration to S, while C4 remains R, yielding (4R,5S)-diol. Both (4S,5R) and (4R,5S) describe the same achiral meso compound.\n        *   (4S,5S)-epoxide + H₂O (anti-attack) → also yields the same (4R,5S)-diol.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This is one achiral compound. Let's label it **M**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n      CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n               \\ /\n                C=C\n               / \\\n              H   H\n    ```\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   The mnemonic is that a *cis*-alkene undergoing *syn*-addition results in a meso compound.\n    *   The product is a cis-epoxide, which for a symmetrically substituted alkene is a meso compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Ring-opening with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is an *anti*-attack.\n    *   The overall reaction is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The stereochemical mnemonic is: **(Z)-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture**.\n    *   Let's verify mechanistically: The meso-epoxide ((4R,5S)-epoxide) reacts.\n        *   Attack at the C4 (R) carbon inverts its configuration to S. The C5 (S) configuration is retained. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at the C5 (S) carbon inverts its configuration to R. The C4 (R) configuration is retained. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, the attacks on C4 and C5 are equally probable, producing a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's label these enantiomers **R** and **S**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **M**: meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n*   **R**: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n*   **S**: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   **R** and **S** are enantiomers.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **R**.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **S**.\n\n### **HPLC Chromatogram Prediction**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers (like M vs. R, and M vs. S) have different physical properties and will have different retention times, thus separating into different peaks.\n    *   Enantiomers (R vs. S) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show two peaks: one for the meso compound (M) and one for the unresolved racemic pair (R+S).\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral column contains a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers.\n    *   It can separate diastereomers (as any column can, in principle).\n    *   Crucially, it can also resolve enantiomers. The interactions (R)-chiral column and (S)-chiral column are diastereomeric and have different energies, leading to different retention times.\n    *   Since M, R, and S are all distinct stereoisomers, and a chiral column can distinguish between all of them (diastereomers M vs. R/S, and enantiomers R vs. S), all three compounds will be resolved.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show three peaks: one for M, one for R, and one for S.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
