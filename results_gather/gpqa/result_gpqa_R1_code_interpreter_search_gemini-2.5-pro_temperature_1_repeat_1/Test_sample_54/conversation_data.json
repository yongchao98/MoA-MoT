    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning used to identify the unknown compound from the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe provided data is:\n*   **Signal 1:** `2.1 ppm (3H, s)`\n*   **Signal 2:** `1.6 ppm (3H, d)`\n*   **Signal 3:** `5.5 ppm (1H, dq)`\n*   **Signal 4:** `7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)`\n\n**2. Identify the Functional Group from Signal 1**\n\n*   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for protons on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Integration (3H):** The signal represents 3 equivalent protons, characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   **Multiplicity (s - singlet):** The protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n*   **Conclusion:** A 3H singlet at ~2.1 ppm is a classic signature for an acetate group (-O-CO-CH3). All four possible options are acetates, so this is consistent.\n\n**3. Determine the Alkyl Chain (Propenyl vs. Butenyl)**\n\n*   Let's sum the total number of protons represented in the spectrum: 3H (from 2.1 ppm) + 3H (from 1.6 ppm) + 1H (from 5.5 ppm) + 1H (from 7.0 ppm) = **8 protons**.\n*   Now, let's find the total number of protons in the candidate molecules:\n    *   **Propenyl acetate (CH3COOCH=CHCH3):** The molecular formula is C5H8O2. It has **8 protons**.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate (CH3COOCH=CHCH2CH3):** The molecular formula is C6H10O2. It has **10 protons**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the NMR integration shows a total of 8 protons, the compound must be **propenyl acetate**. This eliminates options B (Trans-butenyl acetate) and C (Cis-butenyl acetate).\n\n**4. Assign the Remaining Signals to the Propenyl Group**\n\nWe are left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The structure is **CH3(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-CO-CH3(d)**. We need to assign signals 2, 3, and 4 to protons a, b, and c.\n\n*   **Protons (a):** This is the methyl group on the double bond. It is coupled to one adjacent proton, H(b). Therefore, it should appear as a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   This matches **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**. The chemical shift around 1.6-1.8 ppm is typical for an allylic methyl group.\n\n*   **Protons (c):** This is the vinyl proton attached to the carbon that is also bonded to the oxygen atom. The electronegative oxygen atom will strongly deshield this proton, causing it to appear far downfield (at a high ppm value). It is coupled to one adjacent proton, H(b). Therefore, it should be a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   This matches **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**.\n\n*   **Protons (b):** This is the other vinyl proton. It is coupled to two different sets of protons: H(c) (1 proton) and the H(a) methyl group (3 protons). According to the n+1 rule, this signal should be split into a doublet by H(c) and a quartet by H(a). The resulting multiplicity is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n    *   This matches **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**. Its chemical shift is between the other two protons of the propenyl group, which is expected.\n\n**5. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is to determine the geometry of the double bond. This is done by examining the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinyl protons, H(b) and H(c).\n\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value represents the interaction between H(c) and H(b).\n*   The established ranges for vinyl coupling constants are:\n    *   **Trans-coupling (³J_trans):** 12 - 18 Hz\n    *   **Cis-coupling (³J_cis):** 6 - 12 Hz\n*   The observed value of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of the number of protons, the splitting patterns, and the key coupling constant, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
