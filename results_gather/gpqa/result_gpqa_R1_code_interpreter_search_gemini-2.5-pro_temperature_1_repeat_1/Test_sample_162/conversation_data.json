    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Chemical Reaction and Stoichiometry**\n\nFirst, we need to dissolve iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, which is a solid base, using a strong monobasic acid (like HCl, which provides H+ ions). The neutralization reaction is:\n\nFe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) → Fe3+(aq) + 3H2O(l)\n\nThis equation shows that for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 we want to dissolve, we need to add at least 3 moles of H+ ions. Any H+ added beyond this stoichiometric amount will remain in the solution, making it acidic and determining its final pH.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)3**\n\nWe are given 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3. To find the number of moles, we first need its molar mass.\n\n*   Molar Mass of Fe = 55.845 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of H = 1.008 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)3 = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3:\n\nMoles of Fe(OH)3 = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 0.0009357 mol\n\n### **3. Calculate the Minimum Moles of H+ for Dissolution**\n\nFrom the stoichiometry (1 mole Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles H+), we can find the moles of H+ required just to neutralize the Fe(OH)3:\n\nMoles of H+ (for reaction) = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 3 * 0.0009357 mol = 0.0028071 mol\n\nThis is the minimum amount of acid required. The volume of acid added must supply at least this many moles of H+.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Multiple-Choice Options**\n\nThe problem is best solved by checking which of the given options is internally consistent. We will check if the provided volume of acid is sufficient to both dissolve the Fe(OH)3 and result in the given pH.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3**\n*   Volume of acid = 32.14 cm3 = 0.03214 L\n*   Total moles of H+ added = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = 0.003214 mol\n*   Moles of H+ remaining after reaction = Total H+ added - H+ reacted = 0.003214 - 0.0028071 = 0.0004069 mol\n*   Final [H+] = Moles remaining / Total Volume = 0.0004069 mol / 0.1 L = 0.004069 M\n*   Calculated pH = -log10(0.004069) ≈ 2.39\n*   This calculated pH (2.39) does **not** match the given pH (3.16). So, A is incorrect.\n\n**B) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3**\n*   Volume of acid = 28.05 cm3 = 0.02805 L\n*   Total moles of H+ added = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = 0.002805 mol\n*   The moles of H+ added (0.002805 mol) are less than the moles required to dissolve the solid (0.0028071 mol). This means not all of the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 would dissolve. So, B is incorrect.\n\n**C) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3**\n*   Volume of acid = 20.40 cm3 = 0.02040 L\n*   Total moles of H+ added = 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = 0.002040 mol\n*   Similar to option B, the moles of H+ added are less than what is required for complete dissolution (0.0028071 mol). So, C is incorrect.\n\n**D) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3**\n*   Volume of acid = 30.09 cm3 = 0.03009 L\n*   Total moles of H+ added = 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = 0.003009 mol\n*   This is enough acid to dissolve the solid. Let's calculate the final pH.\n*   Moles of H+ remaining after reaction = Total H+ added - H+ reacted = 0.003009 - 0.0028071 = 0.0002019 mol\n*   These remaining moles of H+ are in the final total volume of 100 cm3 (0.1 L).\n*   Final [H+] = Moles remaining / Total Volume = 0.0002019 mol / 0.1 L = 0.002019 M\n*   Calculated pH = -log10(0.002019) ≈ 2.695\n*   This calculated pH (2.695) matches the given pH (2.69) almost perfectly.\n\nThe calculations can be verified using the following Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Data ---\nmass_feoh3 = 0.1  # g\ntotal_volume_L = 0.100  # L (100 cm3)\nacid_conc = 0.1  # M\n\n# --- Constants ---\nmolar_mass_feoh3 = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) # g/mol\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# Moles of Fe(OH)3\nmoles_feoh3 = mass_feoh3 / molar_mass_feoh3\n\n# Moles of H+ needed for stoichiometric reaction\nmoles_h_reacted = 3 * moles_feoh3\n\n# --- Test Option D ---\nvolume_acid_cm3_D = 30.09\nvolume_acid_L_D = volume_acid_cm3_D / 1000\n\n# Total moles of H+ added for Option D\ntotal_moles_h_added_D = acid_conc * volume_acid_L_D\n\n# Moles of H+ remaining in solution\nmoles_h_remaining_D = total_moles_h_added_D - moles_h_reacted\n\n# Final concentration of H+\nfinal_conc_h_D = moles_h_remaining_D / total_volume_L\n\n# Final pH\nfinal_ph_D = -math.log10(final_conc_h_D)\n\nprint(f\"Analysis of Option D:\")\nprint(f\"Acid volume needed: {volume_acid_cm3_D:.2f} cm3\")\nprint(f\"Calculated final pH: {final_ph_D:.2f}\")\n```\n\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nAnalysis of Option D:\nAcid volume needed: 30.09 cm3\nCalculated final pH: 2.70\n```\n*Note: The small difference between 2.69 and 2.70 is due to rounding of molar masses in the problem's source material, but the result clearly confirms that Option D is the correct choice.*\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOption D is the only choice where the volume of acid is sufficient to dissolve all the Fe(OH)3, and the resulting concentration of excess acid yields the specified pH.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The reaction between iron(III) hydroxide and a strong monobasic acid (H+) is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.**\nFirst, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Fe: 55.845 g/mol\n*   O: 15.999 g/mol\n*   H: 1.008 g/mol\nMolar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\nNow, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ from the given mass:\nMoles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 moles\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the moles of H⁺ required for the reaction.**\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺.\nMoles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009357 mol ≈ 0.002807 moles\n\nThis is the minimum amount of H⁺ needed just to dissolve the solid. Any additional H⁺ will determine the final pH of the 100 cm³ solution.\n\n**Step 3: Test the given options.**\nWe will check if the provided acid volume and pH in each option are consistent with our calculations. The final volume of the solution is 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n\n*   **Option A: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n    *   Volume of 0.1 M acid = 32.14 cm³ = 0.03214 L\n    *   Total moles of H⁺ added = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03214 L = 0.003214 mol\n    *   Moles of H⁺ remaining (excess) = Total H⁺ added - H⁺ reacted = 0.003214 - 0.002807 = 0.000407 mol\n    *   Concentration of excess [H⁺] = Moles excess / Total Volume = 0.000407 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00407 M\n    *   Calculated pH = -log₁₀(0.00407) ≈ 2.39. This does not match the given pH of 3.16.\n\n*   **Option B: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n    *   Volume of 0.1 M acid = 28.05 cm³ = 0.02805 L\n    *   Total moles of H⁺ added = 0.1 mol/L × 0.02805 L = 0.002805 mol\n    *   The moles of H⁺ added (0.002805) are less than the moles required to dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ (0.002807). Therefore, the solid would not completely dissolve.\n\n*   **Option C: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n    *   Volume of 0.1 M acid = 20.40 cm³ = 0.02040 L\n    *   Total moles of H⁺ added = 0.1 mol/L × 0.02040 L = 0.002040 mol\n    *   Again, the moles of H⁺ added are less than the required amount (0.002807), so the solid would not dissolve.\n\n*   **Option D: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    *   Volume of 0.1 M acid = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n    *   Total moles of H⁺ added = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = 0.003009 mol\n    *   This is sufficient acid to dissolve the solid.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ remaining (excess) = Total H⁺ added - H⁺ reacted = 0.003009 - 0.002807 = 0.000202 mol\n    *   Concentration of excess [H⁺] = Moles excess / Total Volume = 0.000202 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00202 M\n    *   Calculated pH = -log₁₀(0.00202) ≈ 2.695.\n\nThe calculated pH of ~2.70 is a very close match to the given pH of 2.69. The minor difference is likely due to rounding of molar masses in the problem's source. This option is the only one that is chemically consistent.\n\n<<<D>>>"
