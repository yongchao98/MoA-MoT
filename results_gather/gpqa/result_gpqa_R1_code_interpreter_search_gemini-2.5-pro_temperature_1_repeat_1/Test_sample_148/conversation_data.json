    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data provided:**\n    *   **Â¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   Two distinct peaks are observed for what should be a single type of proton (an alpha-proton).\n        *   The integrals of these two peaks are roughly equal, and their sum corresponds to the expected number of protons (one).\n        *   The peak splitting is not due to spin-spin coupling. This means the two peaks represent the same proton in two different chemical environments.\n    *   **LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry):**\n        *   Two separate peaks are observed in the liquid chromatogram (LC).\n        *   The intensities of these two LC peaks are equal. This indicates the two species are present in a 1:1 ratio.\n        *   Both LC peaks yield the exact same mass spectrum (MS), and this mass is consistent with the target molecule. This proves that the two species are isomers (same molecular formula, same mass) of the expected compound.\n        *   The observation of two peaks at an *elevated temperature* is a key clue. It suggests the two species are stable and do not interconvert rapidly upon heating. If they were, for example, rapidly interconverting conformers (rotamers), heating would cause their signals to merge (coalesce) into a single peak.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the possible explanations (the options provided):**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight. The mass spectrometry data shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the expected product. This option is therefore incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is a vague term, but any side reaction that involves adding an extra molecule or fragment (like a \"double\" coupling) would result in a product with a different mass. Again, the MS data contradicts this. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   **NMR:** In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and produce identical spectra. They would give only *one* peak for the alpha-proton, not two.\n        *   **LC:** On a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are also indistinguishable and would elute as a single peak.\n        *   Therefore, the observation of two peaks in both NMR and LC rules out enantiomers. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. This can happen in peptide synthesis if one of the amino acid starting materials was a racemic mixture (a mix of L and D forms) or if epimerization (inversion of a stereocenter) occurred at one of the alpha-carbons during the synthesis.\n        *   **NMR:** Diastereoisomers have different physical properties and exist in different chemical environments. It is expected that they would give distinct NMR spectra. A single proton type, like the alpha-proton, would show a separate peak for each diastereomer. If the diastereomers were formed in a 1:1 ratio (e.g., from a racemic starting material), their corresponding NMR peaks would have equal integrals. This perfectly matches the NMR observation.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard liquid chromatography, resulting in two distinct peaks. Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data. The equal LC peak intensities confirm the 1:1 ratio.\n        *   This explanation is consistent with all the experimental evidence provided.\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of two species with the same mass but different NMR and LC properties points directly to a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
