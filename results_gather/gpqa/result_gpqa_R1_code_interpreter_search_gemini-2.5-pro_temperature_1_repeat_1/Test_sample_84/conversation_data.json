    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, which is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   R_star is the radius of the star.\n    *   'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (which is the orbital radius for a circular orbit).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))\n    T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2 = A). Therefore, when we take the ratio, these terms will cancel out:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star / (2 * a_1)) * ((2 * a_2) / R_star) )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n    So, the problem reduces to finding the ratio of the orbital radii, a_2 / a_1.\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Radius to Observables:** The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the Doppler shift (Δλ). This is the key to finding the orbital radius 'a'.\n\n5.  **Connect Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity:** The non-relativistic Doppler shift formula relates the change in wavelength (Δλ) to the radial velocity (v_r) of the source (the star):\n    Δλ / λ_0 = v_r / c\n    where λ_0 is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n    The maximum observed Doppler shift (Δλ) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, denoted as K_star.\n    K_star = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\n    From this, we can see that K_star is directly proportional to Δλ (K_star ∝ Δλ).\n\n6.  **Connect Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit (and assuming the planet's mass M_p is much smaller than the star's mass M_star), the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity is given by:\n    K_star = (M_p / M_star) * v_p\n    where v_p is the orbital velocity of the planet.\n    The planet's orbital velocity is given by:\n    v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a) (approximation for M_p << M_star)\n    Substituting v_p into the K_star equation:\n    K_star = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    K_star = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\n7.  **Solve for the Orbital Radius 'a':** We need to rearrange the formula to express 'a' in terms of the other variables.\n    K_star^2 = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * a)\n    a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K_star^2)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Radii (a_2 / a_1):**\n    a_1 = (G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_star1^2)\n    a_2 = (G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_star2^2)\n\n    Now, we compute the ratio a_2 / a_1. The terms G and M_star are the same for both planets and will cancel out:\n    a_2 / a_1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_star2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_star1^2)]\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_star2^2) * (K_star1^2 / M_p1^2)\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\n\n9.  **Substitute K_star with Δλ:** From step 5, we know K_star ∝ Δλ. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n    K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n    Substituting this back into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2\n\n10. **Final Calculation for the Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute the expression for a_2 / a_1 back into the temperature ratio equation from step 3:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)\n\n11. **Plug in the Numerical Values:**\n    *   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    *   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n12. **Compute the final result.**\n```python\n# Given values\nM_p1_ratio = 7  # Planet1 mass in Earth masses\nM_p2_ratio = 5  # Planet2 mass in Earth masses\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03  # Doppler shift for Planet1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04  # Doppler shift for Planet2 in Angstroms\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is given by the formula:\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\n# We use the mass ratios directly as the units cancel out.\n\nratio_T_eq = (M_p2_ratio / M_p1_ratio) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\n\nprint(ratio_T_eq)\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature T_eq of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere T_star is the star's temperature, A is the planet's albedo, R_star is the star's radius, and 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the terms T_star, R_star, and (1 - A) will cancel out:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_star) induced by a planet on its star is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and its orbital semi-major axis (a) by:\nK_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\nwhere M_star is the mass of the star and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe Doppler shift (Δλ) is proportional to the radial velocity (K_star):\nΔλ / λ_0 = K_star / c  => K_star ∝ Δλ\n\nFrom the K_star formula, we can solve for 'a':\nK_star^2 = M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)\na = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K_star^2)\n\nNow we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = [ (G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_star2^2) ] / [ (G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_star1^2) ]\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\n\nSince K_star ∝ Δλ, we have (K_star1 / K_star2) = (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2). Substituting this into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2\n\nNow, substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 )\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04) = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
