    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on a described experiment.\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins (delivered orally). Rotavirus is a gut pathogen.\n    *   **Location:** The fluorescence is tracked to Peyer's patches, which are a type of Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT), a secondary lymphoid organ.\n    *   **Cellular event:** Proliferating cells are isolated from these Peyer's patches. This proliferation indicates an active immune response, likely within a germinal center.\n    *   **Genetic event:** Sequencing of the variable heavy chain (VH) gene from these proliferating cells shows \"high variability.\"\n\n2.  **Evaluate the options in the context of the experiment:**\n    *   **A) Complement activation:** This is a humoral part of the innate immune system. It involves proteins in the blood and does not cause genetic changes in B cells.\n    *   **B) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, determining the antibody isotype (e.g., IgM to IgA). While this happens in germinal centers of Peyer's patches, the question specifies variability in the *variable* heavy chain gene, which is responsible for antigen binding, not the constant region.\n    *   **C) V(D)J recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ) during the development of immature B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. The experiment describes an antigen-dependent response in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n    *   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches) following antigen stimulation. SHM introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This \"high variability\" allows for the selection of B cells producing antibodies with higher affinity for the antigen (a process called affinity maturation).\n\n3.  **Synthesize the analysis:** The experiment describes an antigen-specific B cell response in a Peyer's patch. The key observation is high variability in the *variable heavy chain gene* of *proliferating* B cells. This is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation, which fine-tunes the antibody response to an antigen.\n\n<<<D>>>"
