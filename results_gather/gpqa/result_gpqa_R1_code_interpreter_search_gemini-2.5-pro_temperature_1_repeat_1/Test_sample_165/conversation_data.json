    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants to find the expression for the squared mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson (pGB), denoted as $H_2$, which arises in an extension of the Standard Model. The mass is generated by one-loop radiative corrections.\n\n2.  **Understand the Model:**\n    *   The model extends the Standard Model (SM) with new particles:\n        *   $N_{iR}$: Right-handed singlet fermions (Majorana neutrinos).\n        *   $S$: A scalar doublet with the same quantum numbers as the SM Higgs doublet.\n        *   $\\phi$: A real scalar singlet.\n    *   The Lagrangian specifies the interactions of these new particles.\n        *   $N_{iR}$ gets a Majorana mass $M_{N_i} = y_i \\langle\\phi\\rangle = y_i x$ from the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of $\\phi$.\n        *   There is a new Yukawa-like interaction $g_{i\\alpha}\\bar{N}_{iR}L_{\\alpha}S$ connecting the new fermions, SM leptons ($L_\\alpha$), and the new scalar doublet ($S$).\n    *   The scalar sector is extended, containing the SM Higgs $H$, the new doublet $S$, and the singlet $\\phi$. After electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), the VEVs are $\\langle H \\rangle = v/\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\langle \\phi \\rangle = x$. The physical scalar spectrum will be a mix of the components of these fields, leading to particles denoted as $h_1$ (the SM-like Higgs), $H^0$ (another CP-even scalar), $A^0$ (a CP-odd scalar), and $H^\\pm$ (charged scalars).\n\n3.  **Concept of Pseudo-Goldstone Boson (pGB) Mass:**\n    *   A pGB appears when a global symmetry of the theory is spontaneously broken by the VEV of some scalar field and also explicitly broken by some (typically small) terms in the Lagrangian.\n    *   Without the explicit breaking, the pGB would be a massless Goldstone boson. The explicit-breaking terms generate a mass for it at the loop level.\n    *   The mass is calculated using the Coleman-Weinberg formula. The one-loop contribution to the effective potential is given by:\n        $V_{1-loop} = \\frac{1}{64\\pi^2} \\text{Str} \\left[ M^4(\\Phi) \\left( \\ln \\frac{M^2(\\Phi)}{\\mu^2} - C \\right) \\right]$\n        where $\\text{Str} M^4 = \\sum_{s} (-1)^{2s} N_s M_s^4$. The sum is over all particles, $s$ is the spin, and $N_s$ is the number of degrees of freedom.\n        *   Bosons (spin 0, 1) contribute with a positive sign.\n        *   Fermions (spin 1/2) contribute with a negative sign (due to the fermion loop minus sign and the $(-1)^{2s}$ factor).\n    *   The pGB mass squared is approximately proportional to this supertrace, divided by the squared VEV of the field that breaks the symmetry, $F^2$:\n        $M_{pGB}^2 \\approx \\frac{1}{32\\pi^2 F^2} \\text{Str}[M^4] = \\frac{1}{32\\pi^2 F^2} \\left( \\sum_{\\text{bosons}} N_B M_B^4 - \\sum_{\\text{fermions}} N_f M_f^4 \\right)$.\n        The question provides a simplified form, dropping logarithms and absorbing numerical factors into coefficients $\\alpha_i$.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n\n    *   **Denominator:** The options (except C) have a denominator of $8\\pi^2(x^2+v^2)$. This suggests the symmetry breaking scale is $F^2 = x^2+v^2$, which is a combination of the VEVs of the singlet and doublet fields. The factor $8\\pi^2$ indicates that numerical factors (like degrees of freedom) are absorbed into the coefficients $\\alpha_i$.\n    *   **Option C:** $M_{h_{2}}^{2}=\\frac{\\left(x^{2}+v^{2}\\right)}{8\\pi^{2}}\\left\\{ ... \\right\\}$. The right-hand side has dimensions of (Mass)$^2 \\times ($Mass$)^4 = ($Mass$)^6$, while the left side is (Mass)$^2$. This is dimensionally inconsistent. So, **Option C is incorrect.**\n    *   **Contributions to the Mass (Numerator):** The mass is generated by loops of particles whose mass terms explicitly break the global symmetry. In a general scenario without finely-tuned cancellations, all massive particles in the theory that couple to the scalar sector will contribute.\n        *   **Bosons:** Gauge bosons ($W, Z$) and scalars ($h_1, H^0, A^0, H^\\pm$) should contribute with a positive sign.\n        *   **Fermions:** The top quark ($t$) and the new heavy neutrinos ($N_i$) should contribute with a negative sign.\n    *   **Option A:** $M_{h_{2}}^{2}=\\frac{1}{8\\pi^{2}\\left(x^{2}+v^{2}\\right)}\\left\\{ ... -\\alpha_{7}\\sum M_{N_{i}}^{4}\\right\\}$. This expression is missing the contribution from the top quark ($M_t^4$). The top quark is the heaviest SM particle and has a large Yukawa coupling to the Higgs sector. It is a major source of radiative corrections for any scalar coupled to the Higgs. Its omission is a significant error. So, **Option A is incorrect.**\n    *   **Option D:** $M_{h_{2}}^{2}=\\frac{1}{8\\pi^{2}\\left(x^{2}+v^{2}\\right)}\\left\\{ ... -\\alpha_{7}\\sum M_{N_{i}}^{4}\\right\\}$. This option includes the top quark but is missing the contribution from the pseudoscalar Higgs $A^0$. In a general model with multiple scalars, all scalar mass eigenstates typically couple to each other through the scalar potential. Therefore, one would expect $A^0$ to contribute to the mass of $H_2$ via loop diagrams. Its absence implies a special case or a symmetry that forbids the coupling, which is not specified.\n    *   **Option B:** $M_{h_{2}}^{2}=\\frac{1}{8\\pi^{2}\\left(x^{2}+v^{2}\\right)}\\left\\{ \\alpha_{1}M_{h_{1}}^{4}+\\alpha_{2}M_{W}^{4}+\\alpha_{3}M_{Z}^{4}-\\alpha_{4}M_{t}^{4}+\\alpha_{5}M_{H^{\\pm}}^{4}+\\alpha_{6}M_{H^{0}}^{4}+\\alpha_{7}M_{A^{0}}^{4}-\\alpha_{8}\\sum M_{N_{i}}^{4}\\right\\}$.\n        *   This expression includes contributions from all the massive particles expected in the theory: SM gauge bosons ($W, Z$), the heavy SM fermion ($t$), all the new physical scalars ($h_1, H^0, A^0, H^\\pm$), and the new heavy fermions ($N_i$).\n        *   The signs are correct: positive for all bosons and negative for all fermions.\n        *   This represents the most general and complete expression among the choices.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the principles of radiative mass generation for a pseudo-Goldstone boson, Option B provides the most complete and physically sound formula. It correctly includes contributions from all relevant sectors of the theory with the appropriate signs.\n\n<<<B>>>"
