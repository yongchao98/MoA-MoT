    "**1. Analyze the requirements from the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** All candidate compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets of equal intensity (1:1 ratio). Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means each compound must contribute a signal (or signals) for its aromatic protons, and the total number of protons represented by each of the two final singlets must be equal.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1. All signals are singlets, which means there is no proton-proton coupling between adjacent carbons (e.g., no ethyl or propyl groups). This rules out 1,4-diethylbenzene, which would show a quartet and a triplet.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** (integrating to 12H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 4 and 6) are in different chemical environments. They are not adjacent, so they will appear as **two separate singlets** (each integrating to 1H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments. They will produce **four separate singlets** (each integrating to 3H).\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 4 alkyl singlets (3H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C1-C2 and C4-C5 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. Since they are equivalent and adjacent, they behave as a single group and produce **one singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other, but different from the first pair. This results in **two singlets** (each integrating to 6H, for a 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Ethyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. They will show a **quartet** (CH2, 4H) and a **triplet** (CH3, 6H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet, 1 alkyl quartet, 1 alkyl triplet. This is immediately ruled out as the problem states all alkyl signals are singlets.\n\n**3. Evaluate the options based on a 1:1 mixture:**\n\nLet's test the combination in each option to see if it matches the observed spectrum (2 aromatic singlets in 1:1 ratio; 3 alkyl singlets in 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene gives a quartet and triplet.\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a **1:1** integral ratio (2H:2H). This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **three singlets** with an integral ratio of **12H:6H:6H**, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). The mixture would show three aromatic singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match.\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). The mixture would show three aromatic singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
