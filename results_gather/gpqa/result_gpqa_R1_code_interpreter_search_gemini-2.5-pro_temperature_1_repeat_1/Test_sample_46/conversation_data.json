    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is a calculation to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   DoU = C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1\n    *   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1\n    *   DoU = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1\n    *   DoU = 5\n*   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a double bond, probably a carbonyl group (C=O), which is suggested by the IR spectrum.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in the region above 3300 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. A secondary amine (-NHR) would show only one band, and a tertiary amine has no N-H bonds.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for an **ester (R-C(=O)-OR')**. The fact that it's slightly lower than the typical 1735-1750 cm⁻¹ for a simple alkyl ester suggests that the carbonyl group is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** The signal is a triplet (t), meaning it has 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). It integrates to 3 protons (3H). This pattern is classic for a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** The signal is a quartet (q), meaning it has 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). It integrates to 2 protons (2H). This is the corresponding methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to the methyl group. The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The high chemical shift (deshielding) of the methylene protons to 4.5 ppm indicates it is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen, as in an **ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to 2 protons. This chemical shift and broadness are characteristic of the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is due to quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange with trace amounts of acid/water. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). Both are doublets (d), and each integrates to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is highly indicative of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons on the ring are split into two sets of two equivalent protons. The significant difference in chemical shift between the two doublets suggests that one substituent on the ring is strongly electron-donating, and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing.\n    *   The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-donating group. An amine (-NH₂) is a strong electron-donating group.\n    *   The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing group. An ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\nBased on the fragments identified:\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nPutting these pieces together, we have an amino group and an ethyl carboxylate group attached to a benzene ring at the 1 and 4 positions. This gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### 5. Verifying with the Options\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR. The C=O stretch would be at a much lower frequency (~1670 cm⁻¹).\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This has a propionate group (CH₃CH₂COO-), not an ethyl ester. The NMR would show the CH₂ of the propionyl group around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: C₉H₁₁NO₂, a primary amine, a conjugated ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring with appropriate NMR shifts.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, not an ester. The substitution pattern is meta (1,3), which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two doublets.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
