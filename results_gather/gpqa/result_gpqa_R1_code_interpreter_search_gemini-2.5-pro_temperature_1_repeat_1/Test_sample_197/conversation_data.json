    "This problem requires us to calculate the molar fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)2], and express it as a percentage.\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:**\n    In a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-), a series of complexation equilibria will be established. The cobalt-containing species are:\n    *   Free Co^2+ ion\n    *   [Co(SCN)]^+\n    *   [Co(SCN)2] (the species of interest)\n    *   [Co(SCN)3]^-\n    *   [Co(SCN)4]^2-\n\n2.  **Define the total cobalt concentration:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]\n\n3.  **Use the overall stability constants (β):**\n    The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free Co^2+ concentration, the ligand concentration [SCN-], and the overall stability constants (β_n).\n    *   [[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]\n    *   [[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2\n    *   [[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3\n    *   [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4\n\n4.  **Express the total cobalt concentration in terms of [Co^2+]:**\n    By substituting the expressions from step 3 into the equation from step 2, we can factor out [Co^2+]:\n    c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4)\n\n5.  **Calculate the fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex:**\n    The fraction of any specific species is its concentration divided by the total concentration. We want to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)2], which we'll call α2.\n    α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)\n\n    Substituting the expressions from steps 3 and 4:\n    α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4))\n\n    The [Co^2+] term cancels out, simplifying the expression. Notice that the total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10^-2 M, is not needed for this calculation.\n    α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4)\n\n6.  **Perform the calculation with the given values:**\n    *   [SCN-] = 0.1 M\n    *   β1 = 9\n    *   β2 = 40\n    *   β3 = 63\n    *   β4 = 16\n\nLet's compute each term in the expression. Let L = [SCN-] = 0.1.\n*   Numerator: β2 * L^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Denominator terms:\n    *   1\n    *   β1 * L = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   β2 * L^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4\n    *   β3 * L^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   β4 * L^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n*   Denominator (Sum): 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nNow, calculate the fraction α2:\nα2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n7.  **Convert to percentage:**\n    Percentage = α2 * 100% ≈ 16.916%\n\nThis value is closest to 16.9%.\n\nWe can verify this with a short Python script.\n```python\n# Given values\nSCN_conc = 0.1  # M\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Calculate the terms for the distribution equation\n# Let L = SCN_conc\nterm0 = 1\nterm1 = beta1 * SCN_conc\nterm2 = beta2 * SCN_conc**2\nterm3 = beta3 * SCN_conc**3\nterm4 = beta4 * SCN_conc**4\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms, representing the relative total concentration\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# The numerator is the term for the species of interest, [Co(SCN)2], which is term2\nnumerator = term2\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha2)\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage=}\")\n```\n>>>\npercentage=16.916180326482276\n>>>\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 25.6%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 16.9%\nD) 42.3%\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify all cobalt-containing species.**\n    In the solution, Co(II) ions react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes. The possible species are the free aquated ion and the successive complexes:\n    *   Co²⁺\n    *   [Co(SCN)]⁺\n    *   [Co(SCN)₂]\n    *   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n    *   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\n2.  **Define the total concentration of cobalt.**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, denoted as c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n3.  **Use the overall stability constants (βn).**\n    The concentration of each complex can be related to the concentration of the free metal ion [Co²⁺] and the ligand concentration [SCN⁻] using the overall stability constants (βn):\n    *   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ × [Co²⁺] × [SCN⁻]¹\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ × [Co²⁺] × [SCN⁻]²\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ × [Co²⁺] × [SCN⁻]³\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ × [Co²⁺] × [SCN⁻]⁴\n\n4.  **Express the total concentration in terms of [Co²⁺].**\n    By substituting the expressions from step 3 into the equation from step 2, we get:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + (β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) + (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) + (β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) + (β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n    Factoring out [Co²⁺] gives:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] × (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n5.  **Calculate the fraction of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex.**\n    The fraction of a particular species (in this case, [Co(SCN)₂]) is its concentration divided by the total concentration of all related species. This fraction is often denoted as α₂.\n    α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\n    Substituting the expressions for [[Co(SCN)₂]] and c(Co):\n    α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] × (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\n    The [Co²⁺] term cancels out, which means the fraction does not depend on the total cobalt concentration:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n6.  **Substitute the given values and compute the result.**\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n    First, calculate the terms in the denominator:\n    *   Term 0: 1\n    *   Term 1: β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   Term 2: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   Term 3: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   Term 4: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\n    The denominator is the sum of these terms:\n    Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n    The numerator is Term 2:\n    Numerator = 0.4\n\n    Now, calculate the fraction α₂:\n    α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n7.  **Convert the fraction to a percentage.**\n    Percentage = α₂ × 100% = 0.16916 × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
