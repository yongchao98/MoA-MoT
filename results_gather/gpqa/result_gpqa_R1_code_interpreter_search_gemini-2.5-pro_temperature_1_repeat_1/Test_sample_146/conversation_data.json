    "Annihilation is a process that occurs when a subatomic particle collides with its respective antiparticle to produce other particles, such as photons or other particle-antiparticle pairs. In this problem, we analyze the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) which results in the creation of two pairs of a new particle-antiparticle, $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$.\n\nThe reaction is given by:\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\nWe are given that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of particle physics, this typically implies that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume both the proton and the antiproton are effectively at rest in the lab frame. This means the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the velocity of the resulting A particles. To do this, we will use the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n**1. Calculate the total initial energy ($E_i$)**\n\nThe initial system consists of a proton and an antiproton, both considered to be at rest. The total initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies.\nThe mass of a proton ($m_p$) is equal to the mass of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$). The rest energy of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 = 938.272 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n$E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n$E_i = 2 \\times 938.272 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.544 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Calculate the total final energy ($E_f$)**\n\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$. We are given that the rest energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nDue to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum is zero), the four final particles must move away from the interaction point with a total momentum of zero. The most symmetric and simplest configuration is that all four particles have the same magnitude of momentum and thus the same kinetic energy and total energy. Let's denote the total energy of a single A particle as $E_A$.\n\nThe total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n$E_f = 4 \\times E_A$\n\nThe energy of each A particle is its relativistic energy, given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$, and $v$ is the speed of the particle.\n\nSo, the total final energy is:\n$E_f = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**3. Apply the conservation of energy**\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, the total initial energy must equal the total final energy:\n$E_i = E_f$\n$2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWe can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{938.272 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.272}{600} \\approx 1.563787$\n\n**4. Calculate the velocity (v)**\n\nNow that we have the Lorentz factor, we can find the velocity, $v$. The relationship between $\\gamma$ and the velocity ratio $\\beta = v/c$ is:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\gamma$ we calculated:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.563787)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.44547}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.408919}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{0.591081} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThus, the velocity of particle A is $v = 0.7688c$. This value is closest to 0.77c.\n\n<<<A>>>"
