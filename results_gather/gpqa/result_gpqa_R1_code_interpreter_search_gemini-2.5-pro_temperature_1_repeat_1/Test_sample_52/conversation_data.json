    "This problem requires us to deduce the molecular formula of an unknown compound by interpreting its spectroscopic data (FTIR and 1H NMR).\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a C6H4 core.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group is present. An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   Total of six signals.\n        *   Two signals for aromatic protons (Ar-H). A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4) substitution, which would give an AA'BB' system often appearing as two distinct signals (e.g., two doublets).\n        *   Two signals for vinyl protons (C=CH). One is a doublet (d), and the other is a doublet of quartets (dq). This splitting pattern is characteristic of a `-CH=CH-CH3` group (a propenyl group).\n            *   Let's label the protons: `(Ar)-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n            *   Proton H(a) is adjacent to proton H(b), so it will be split into a doublet.\n            *   Proton H(b) is adjacent to proton H(a) (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (giving a quartet). Thus, its signal is a doublet of quartets. This perfectly matches the description.\n        *   Two signals for methyl groups (-CH3). One of these methyl groups is from the propenyl (`-CH=CH-CH3`) group identified above. The other methyl group must be part of the ester substituent.\n        *   No signals for methylene groups (-CH2-). This is a crucial constraint that helps eliminate potential structures.\n\n2.  **Identify the molecular fragments:**\n    *   **Core:** A di-substituted benzene ring: `C6H4`.\n    *   **Substituent 1:** A propenyl group from the vinyl and one of the methyl signals: `-CH=CH-CH3`. The formula for this fragment is `C3H5`. It contains no -CH2- groups.\n    *   **Substituent 2:** An ester group containing the second methyl group. There are two common possibilities that don't have a -CH2- group:\n        *   A methyl ester group: `-COOCH3`. The formula for this fragment is `C2H3O2`.\n        *   An acetate group: `-OCOCH3`. The formula for this fragment is also `C2H3O2`.\n    *   Both ester possibilities are consistent with the \"no -CH2-\" rule.\n\n3.  **Assemble the fragments to determine the molecular formula:**\n    We combine the identified fragments to construct the whole molecule.\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4 ring) + 3 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 2 (from C2H3O2 ester) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4 ring) + 5 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 3 (from C2H3O2 ester) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2 ester) = **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify the result:**\n    *   The formula C11H12O2 matches one of the options (B).\n    *   Let's check the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)** for C11H12O2.\n        *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   The proposed structure contains a benzene ring (DoU = 4), one C=C double bond (DoU = 1), and one C=O double bond (DoU = 1).\n    *   Total expected DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   The calculated DoU matches the expected DoU from the structure, confirming our assignment is consistent.\n    *   The other options can be ruled out. For example, C11H14O2 (DoU=5) would not accommodate both a benzene ring and two double bonds. C12H14O2 (DoU=6) would require an additional `CH2` unit compared to our derived formula, which would violate the \"no -CH2- signals\" rule.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to the molecular formula C11H12O2.\n\n```python\n# Define the chemical composition of each fragment based on the analysis of the spectroscopic data.\n# Fragment 1: Di-substituted benzene ring\nfragment1 = {'C': 6, 'H': 4, 'O': 0}\n\n# Fragment 2: Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)\nfragment2 = {'C': 3, 'H': 5, 'O': 0}\n\n# Fragment 3: Ester group with a methyl group (e.g., -COOCH3 or -OCOCH3)\nfragment3 = {'C': 2, 'H': 3, 'O': 2}\n\n# Sum the atoms from all fragments to get the total molecular formula.\ntotal_C = fragment1['C'] + fragment2['C'] + fragment3['C']\ntotal_H = fragment1['H'] + fragment2['H'] + fragment3['H']\ntotal_O = fragment1['O'] + fragment2['O'] + fragment3['O']\n\n# Print the final molecular formula.\nprint(f\"C{total_C}H{total_H}O{total_O}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the given structural information:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogens with substituents. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group is present. The general formula for an ester is R-COO-R'. This group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum data:**\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (C6H4). The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, likely a para (1,4) substitution, which would give two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This confirms the C6H4 fragment, contributing 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is a classic indicator of a propenyl group, specifically `-CH=CH-CH3`, attached to another group (in this case, the aromatic ring).\n        *   Let's analyze the protons: `(Aryl)-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n        *   The proton `H(a)` is split by `H(b)` into a doublet.\n        *   The proton `H(b)` is split by `H(a)` (a doublet) and the three protons of the `-CH3` group (a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n        *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment. This fragment contributes 3 carbons and (1+1+3) = 5 hydrogens.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) we just identified. The second methyl group must belong to the ester substituent.\n    *   **No signals corresponding to –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information. The ester group cannot be, for example, `-COOCH2CH3` or `-CH2COOCH3` as these would produce `-CH2-` signals. The only simple ester structure containing a methyl group and no methylene group is a methyl ester, `-COOCH3`. This fragment contributes 2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens.\n\n3.  **Assemble the molecular formula from the identified fragments:**\n    *   **Fragment 1 (Aromatic Ring):** C6H4\n    *   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl Group):** C3H5 (`-CH=CH-CH3`)\n    *   **Fragment 3 (Methyl Ester Group):** C2H3O2 (`-COOCH3`)\n\n4.  **Sum the atoms from all fragments:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 0 + 0 + 2 (from ester) = 2\n\n5.  **Final Molecular Formula:** The deduced formula is C11H12O2.\n\n6.  **Verify with the provided options:**\n    *   A) C11H14O2\n    *   B) C11H12O2\n    *   C) C12H12O2\n    *   D) C12H14O2\n    Our calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option B. The python code execution also confirmed this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
