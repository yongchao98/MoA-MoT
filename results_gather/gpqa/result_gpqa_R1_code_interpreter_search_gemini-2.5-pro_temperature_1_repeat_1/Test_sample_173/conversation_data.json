    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its total energy is its rest-mass energy, E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2. These fragments are moving, so they have both rest-mass energy and kinetic energy.\n\n**2. Determine the Rest Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe are given two pieces of information about the fragment masses:\n*   One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's say m1 is the more massive one, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations:\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the second equation:\n    `2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n2.  Now find m1:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies in terms of the initial energy:\n*   Rest energy of the more massive fragment (m1): `E1_rest = m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * M * c^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest energy of the less massive fragment (m2): `E2_rest = m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * M * c^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy to Find the Total Kinetic Energy**\n\nThe total energy must be conserved.\n*   `E_initial = E_final`\n*   `M * c^2 = (T1 + m1*c^2) + (T2 + m2*c^2)`\n    where T1 and T2 are the kinetic energies of the fragments.\n\nThe total kinetic energy released (often called the Q-value) is:\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, the two fragments share a total of 3 GeV of kinetic energy.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe initial nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n*   `p_initial = 0`\n*   `p_final = p1 + p2 = 0`\n*   This means the fragments move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n\nWe can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, the ratio is `m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy:\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**6. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. Since the total energy is `E = T + m*c^2`, we can write:\n*   `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n*   Expanding this gives `T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2) + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n*   This simplifies to `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n\nSince the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments:\n*   `(p*c)^2 = T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1*c^2)`\n*   `(p*c)^2 = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2*c^2)`\n\nSet them equal:\n*   `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2*c^2)`\n\nNow, substitute the known values: `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`.\n*   `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   Cancel `T1^2` from both sides:\n    `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n*   Combine terms:\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   Solve for T1:\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600 * T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**7. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation, and convert it to MeV.\n*   Difference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nConvert to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculation.\n```python\n# All energy values are in GeV\n\n# Step 1: Define initial conditions\nE_initial = 300.0  # Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus in GeV\n\n# Step 2: Calculate fragment rest-mass energies\n# Given: m1 = 2 * m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n# This leads to m1 = 0.66 * M and m2 = 0.33 * M.\nm1_c2 = 0.66 * E_initial\nm2_c2 = 0.33 * E_initial\n\n# Step 3: Calculate total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\nQ = E_initial - (m1_c2 + m2_c2)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n# From T1/T2 = m2/m1 and T1+T2=Q, we get T1_classical = Q / 3.0\nT1_classical = Q / 3.0\n\n# Step 5: Calculate T1 using relativistic mechanics\n# We solve T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1_c2) = (Q-T1)^2 + 2*(Q-T1)*m2_c2 for T1.\n# This simplifies to T1 = (Q^2 + 2*Q*m2_c2) / (2*m1_c2 + 2*Q + 2*m2_c2).\nnumerator = Q**2 + 2 * Q * m2_c2\ndenominator = 2 * m1_c2 + 2 * Q + 2 * m2_c2\nT1_relativistic = numerator / denominator\n\n# Step 6: Calculate the difference in MeV\ndifference_MeV = (T1_relativistic - T1_classical) * 1000\n\nprint(f\"{difference_MeV:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n5.00\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, which means its total initial energy is its rest-mass energy.\n*   E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV\n\nThe nucleus fissions into two fragments, m1 and m2. We are given the following relationships for their rest masses:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's say m1 is the more massive one:\n    *   m1 = 2 * m2\n2.  The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M:\n    *   m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the masses of the fragments in terms of M:\n*   Substitute (1) into (2): (2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M => 3 * m2 = 0.99 * M => **m2 = 0.33 * M**\n*   Now find m1: m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) => **m1 = 0.66 * M**\n\nNow, let's find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   Rest energy of the more massive fragment (m1): E1_rest = m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = **198 GeV**\n*   Rest energy of the less massive fragment (m2): E2_rest = m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = **99 GeV**\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the initial energy equals the total final energy (rest energies + kinetic energies of the fragments).\n*   E_initial = E_final = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)\n*   The total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is:\n    *   Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n    *   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = **3 GeV**\n\nThe initial nucleus was at rest, so the initial momentum was zero. By conservation of momentum, the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n*   |p1| = |p2| = p\n\n**Case 1: Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation for T1**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m).\n*   T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)\n*   T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n*   T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = (0.33 M) / (0.66 M) = 1/2\n*   So, T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical\nNow, we use the total kinetic energy:\n*   T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV\n*   T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV\n*   3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV\n*   **T1_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n**Case 2: Correct (Relativistic) Calculation for T1**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2. This can be rearranged to find the momentum: (p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2.\nSince the momenta are equal, (p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2.\n*   E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\nWe also know from energy conservation that E1 + E2 = E_initial = 300 GeV. So, E2 = 300 - E1.\n*   E1^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E1)^2 - (99)^2\n*   E1^2 - 39204 = (90000 - 600*E1 + E1^2) - 9801\nCancel the E1^2 terms:\n*   -39204 = 90000 - 600*E1 - 9801\n*   -39204 = 80199 - 600*E1\n*   600*E1 = 80199 + 39204\n*   600*E1 = 119403\n*   E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV\nThe kinetic energy T1 is the total energy E1 minus the rest energy m1*c^2:\n*   T1_relativistic = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = **1.005 GeV**\n\n**Final Step: Calculate the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1 is:\n*   Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = **5 MeV**\n\n<<<B>>>"
