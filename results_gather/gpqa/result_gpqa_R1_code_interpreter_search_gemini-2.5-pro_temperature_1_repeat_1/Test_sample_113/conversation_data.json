    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n    *   **Reactants:**\n        *   Butan-2-one is a ketone (CH₃-CO-CH₂-CH₃).\n        *   NaCN provides the cyanide ion (⁻CN), a strong nucleophile.\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃).\n    *   **Transformation:** The C=O group of the ketone is converted into a C-OH group and a C-CN group on the same carbon. This is a classic **cyanohydrin formation** reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The nucleophilic cyanide ion (⁻CN) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This forms an alkoxide intermediate: CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃.\n        3.  This negatively charged alkoxide ion needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. Looking at the options for A, `H₃O⁺` represents an acidic medium (like adding dilute HCl or H₂SO₄), which serves as the required proton source. `NaHSO₃` is used for forming bisulfite addition products and is not the standard reagent for this protonation step. Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n    *   **Reactant:** A nitrile compound (specifically, an α-hydroxy nitrile). The key functional group undergoing reaction is the nitrile group (-C≡N).\n    *   **Product:** A carboxylic acid. The nitrile group (-C≡N) has been converted into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Transformation:** This reaction is the **hydrolysis of a nitrile**.\n    *   **Conditions:** Nitrile hydrolysis is typically carried out by heating with either a strong aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) or a strong aqueous base (like NaOH). The presence of `H₂O` is explicitly mentioned.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B must be the catalyst for this hydrolysis.\n        *   `HCl` is a strong acid and is a standard reagent for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid and is generally not effective enough to perform this hydrolysis efficiently.\n    *   Therefore, the most suitable reagent for **B is HCl**.\n\n3.  **Combine the findings and select the correct option:**\n    *   We have determined that A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   We have determined that B = HCl.\n    *   Matching this with the given choices:\n        *   A) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH (Incorrect)\n        *   B) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl (Correct)\n        *   C) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl (Incorrect)\n        *   D) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH (Incorrect)\n\nThe correct combination of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<B>>>"
