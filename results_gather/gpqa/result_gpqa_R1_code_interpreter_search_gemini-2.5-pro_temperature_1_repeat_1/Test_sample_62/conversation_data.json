    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Model and States:**\n    The problem describes a diatomic molecule using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The energy levels for this model are given by:\n    $E(v, J) = (v + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}J(J+1)$\n    where:\n    *   $v$ is the vibrational quantum number ($v = 0, 1, 2, ...$)\n    *   $J$ is the rotational quantum number ($J = 0, 1, 2, ...$)\n    *   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}$)\n    *   $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of vibration.\n    *   $I$ is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n2.  **Identify the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state, or the state of lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum values: $v_i = 0$ and $J_i = 0$.\n    *   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" For a photon absorption, there are selection rules that govern which transitions are allowed:\n        *   $\\Delta v = v_{final} - v_{initial} = +1$ (for absorption in the harmonic approximation)\n        *   $\\Delta J = J_{final} - J_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   Starting from the initial state $(v_i, J_i) = (0, 0)$:\n        *   The change in vibrational state must be $\\Delta v = +1$, so $v_f = 1$.\n        *   The change in rotational state must be $\\Delta J = \\pm 1$. Since $J$ cannot be negative, the only possibility is $\\Delta J = +1$, so $J_f = 1$.\n    *   Therefore, the transition is from the state $(v_i, J_i) = (0, 0)$ to $(v_f, J_f) = (1, 1)$. This transition corresponds to the first line of the R-branch in the rovibrational spectrum.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon ($\\Delta E$):**\n    The energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    $\\Delta E = E(v_f, J_f) - E(v_i, J_i)$\n    $\\Delta E = E(1, 1) - E(0, 0)$\n    $E(1, 1) = (1 + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}1(1+1) = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n    $E(0, 0) = (0 + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}0(0+1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n    $\\Delta E = (\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}) - (\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega) = \\hbar\\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Moment of Inertia ($I$):**\n    The moment of inertia is $I = \\mu R^2$, where $\\mu$ is the reduced mass.\n    *   **Reduced Mass ($\\mu$):**\n        $\\mu = \\frac{M_X M_Y}{M_X + M_Y} = \\frac{20 \\text{ amu} \\times 2 \\text{ amu}}{20 \\text{ amu} + 2 \\text{ amu}} = \\frac{40}{22} \\text{ amu} = \\frac{20}{11} \\text{ amu}$\n    *   We need to convert $\\mu$ to kg and $R$ to meters to use SI units.\n        *   $1 \\text{ amu} = 1.6605 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}$\n        *   $\\mu = \\frac{20}{11} \\times (1.6605 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}) \\approx 3.019 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}$\n        *   $R = 2 \\text{ angstroms} = 2 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}$\n    *   **Moment of Inertia ($I$):**\n        $I = \\mu R^2 = (3.019 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m})^2 = 1.2076 \\times 10^{-46} \\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^2$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Photon's Momentum ($p$):**\n    The relationship between a photon's energy and momentum is $E = pc$, where $c$ is the speed of light ($3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$).\n    Therefore, $p = \\frac{\\Delta E}{c} = \\frac{1}{c} (\\hbar\\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I})$.\n\n    We can now substitute the values. To maintain precision, we will use a Python script for the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nMx_amu = 20.0  # mass of atom X in amu\nMy_amu = 2.0   # mass of atom Y in amu\nR_angstrom = 2.0  # bond length in angstroms\nw_rad_s = 4.0e14  # angular frequency in rad/s\n\n# Physical constants\namu_to_kg = 1.660539e-27  # kg\nhbar = 1.0545718e-34      # J*s (reduced Planck constant)\nc = 2.99792458e8         # m/s (speed of light)\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n\n# 1.

Calculate moment of inertia (I)\nI = mu_kg * R_m**2\n\n# 4. Calculate the energy difference (Delta E) for the transition (v=0, J=0) -> (v=1, J=1)\n# Delta E = h_bar * w + h_bar^2 / I\ndelta_E = (hbar * w_rad_s) + (hbar**2 / I)\n\n# 5.

Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) p = 2.3 * 10^(-27) N*s\nB) p = 1.1 * 10^(-27) N*s\nC) p = 1.9 * 10^(-28) N*s\nD) p = 1.4 * 10^(-28) N*s\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user has provided the output of the Python code I generated.\nThe code output is `1.410e-28`.\n\nLet's review the logic and the result.\n1.  **Identify the initial and final states**: The molecule starts in the ground state (fundamental state), where the vibrational quantum number $v=0$ and the rotational quantum number $J=0$. For an absorption of a photon to the next lowest energy state, the selection rules are $\\Delta v = +1$ and $\\Delta J = +1$. Thus, the final state is $v=1, J=1$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy of the transition**: The energy levels of the non-rigid rotor are given by $E_{v,J} = (v + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + B J(J+1)$, where $B = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}$ is the rotational constant.\n    *   Initial energy: $E_{0,0} = (0 + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + B \\cdot 0(1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   Final energy: $E_{1,1} = (1 + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + B \\cdot 1(2) = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + 2B$\n    *   The energy of the absorbed photon is the difference: $\\Delta E = E_{1,1} - E_{0,0} = (\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + 2B) - \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega = \\hbar\\omega + 2B = \\hbar\\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$. This matches the formula used in the code.\n\n3.  **Calculate the momentum of the photon**: The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by $p = \\frac{\\Delta E}{c}$.\n\n4.  **Perform the numerical calculation**: The Python script calculated this value using the provided data and physical constants.\n    *   Mx = 20 amu\n    *   My = 2 amu\n    *   R = 2 angstroms = $2 \\times 10^{-10}$ m\n    *   $\\omega = 4 \\times 10^{14}$ rad/s\n    *   The script calculated the reduced mass $\\mu$, the moment of inertia $I = \\mu R^2$, the energy difference $\\Delta E$, and finally the momentum $p$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the result**: The output of the code is $p = 1.410 \\times 10^{-28}$ N·s. We compare this to the given options:\n    A) $p = 2.3 \\times 10^{-27}$ N·s\n    B) $p = 1.1 \\times 10^{-27}$ N·s\n    C) $p = 1.9 \\times 10^{-28}$ N·s\n    D) $p = 1.4 \\times 10^{-28}$ N·s\n\nThe calculated value $1.410 \\times 10^{-28}$ N·s is very close to $1.4 \\times 10^{-28}$ N·s. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
