    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum Mechanical Operators:**\n    The problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ in terms of the Pauli matrices, scaled by a factor of $\\hbar/2$. These are the spin angular momentum operators for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon.\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector:**\n    The direction $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary direction lying in the x-z plane. A unit vector in the x-z plane can be parameterized by a single angle, the polar angle $\\theta$ (the angle with the z-axis), while the azimuthal angle $\\phi$ is 0.\n    In spherical coordinates, a general unit vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$.\n    For a vector in the x-z plane, we set $\\phi=0$, which gives:\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n    So, the components of $\\vec{n}$ are $n_x = \\sin\\theta$, $n_y = 0$, and $n_z = \\cos\\theta$.\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator along the Direction $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y(0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta$\n    Now, substitute the matrices for $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_z$:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. Let the eigenvector be represented by a column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve the System of Linear Equations:**\n    We can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This matrix equation gives a system of two linear equations:\n    (1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    (2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n    Let's solve the first equation for the relationship between $a$ and $b$:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $b = a \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n    To simplify this expression, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n    Substituting these into the expression for $b$:\n    $b = a \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = a \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    So, the eigenvector has the form $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:**\n    The normalization condition requires that the inner product of the state with itself is 1, i.e., $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$. For a column vector, this means the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of its components is 1:\n    $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$\n    Substitute $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$:\n    $|a|^2 + |a \\tan(\\theta/2)|^2 = 1$\n    $|a|^2 (1 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n    Using the identity $1 + \\tan^2(x) = \\sec^2(x)$:\n    $|a|^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n    $|a|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sec^2(\\theta/2)} = \\cos^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $|a| = |\\cos(\\theta/2)|$. We can choose the overall phase of the eigenvector such that $a$ is real and positive. For $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\pi$, $\\cos(\\theta/2) \\ge 0$. So we can set $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$.\n    Now, we find $b$:\n    $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n\n7.  **Final Eigenvector:**\n    The normalized eigenvector is:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    Comparing our result with the given options:\n    A) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$\n    B) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$\n    C) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$\n    D) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$\n\n    Our result matches option D."
