    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify and formulate the paramagnetic coupling term, $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$.**\n    The paramagnetic coupling term describes the interaction energy of an atom's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. This is also known as the linear Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is given by:\n    $H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n    where $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic moment and $\\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field.\n\n    The orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n    $\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$\n    where $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_e$ is the mass of the electron.\n\n    Substituting this into the Hamiltonian, we get:\n    $H = \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\n    The problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the Oz axis, so we can write $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The dot product becomes:\n    $\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$\n\n    The energy of this coupling is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$. The expectation value of the $z$-component of the angular momentum, $\\left\\langle L_z \\right\\rangle$, is given by $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n    $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} \\left\\langle L_z \\right\\rangle = \\frac{e\\hbar B}{2m_e} m$\n\n    The quantity $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is a fundamental constant known as the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$.\n    So, the paramagnetic coupling energy is:\n    $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B$\n\n2.  **Calculate the value of the paramagnetic coupling energy $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$.**\n    We are given:\n    *   $B = 1 \\, \\text{T}$\n    *   $m$ is a small integer. To determine the order of magnitude, we can use the smallest non-zero integer value, $m=1$.\n    *   The value of the Bohr magneton is $\\mu_B \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T}$ or, more conveniently, $\\mu_B \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}$.\n\n    Using the value in electron-volts (eV):\n    $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T}) = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n\n3.  **Identify and formulate the transition energy, $\\Delta E$.**\n    The transition energy $\\Delta E$ corresponds to the energy of a photon with a given wavelength $\\lambda$. The relationship is:\n    $\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n    where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n4.  **Calculate the value of the transition energy $\\Delta E$.**\n    We are given:\n    *   $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm}$\n    *   The product $hc$ is approximately $1240 \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}$.\n\n    Using these values:\n    $\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n    (Note: This wavelength corresponds to the Balmer series transition from $n=4$ to $n=2$ in the hydrogen atom.)\n\n5.  **Compare the magnitudes of $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$ and $\\Delta E$.**\n    *   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n    *   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\n    Let's look at the ratio:\n    $\\frac{\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}}{2.55 \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\n    Since the ratio is extremely small (on the order of $10^{-5}$), the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the atomic transition energy.\n\n    Therefore, we can conclude that $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E$.\n\nTo verify the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# --- Given values ---\n# Magnetic field in Tesla\nB = 1.0\n# A small integer value for the magnetic quantum number\nm = 1\n# Wavelength in meters\nwavelength = 0.4861e-6\n\n# --- Physical Constants ---\n# Bohr magneton in J/T\nmu_B_J = const.value('Bohr magneton')\n# Bohr magneton in eV/T\nmu_B_eV = const.value('Bohr magneton in eV/T')\n# Product of Planck's constant and speed of light in eV*nm\nhc_eV_nm = 1240\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# 1. Paramagnetic coupling energy in eV\n# <H> = m * mu_B * B\nparamagnetic_energy_eV = m * mu_B_eV * B\n\n# 2. Transition energy in eV\n# Convert wavelength to nm\nwavelength_nm = wavelength * 1e9\n# Delta E = hc / lambda\ntransition_energy_eV = hc_eV_nm / wavelength_nm\n\n# --- Output ---\nprint(f\"Paramagnetic coupling energy <H> = {paramagnetic_energy_eV:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Transition energy Delta E = {transition_energy_eV:.3f} eV\")\nprint(f\"The order of magnitude of <H> is approximately 10^{int(round(math.log10(paramagnetic_energy_eV),0))} eV.\")\nprint(f\"The order of magnitude of Delta E is approximately 10^{int(round(math.log10(transition_energy_eV),0))} eV.\")\nprint(f\"The ratio <H> / Delta E is {paramagnetic_energy_eV / transition_energy_eV:.3e}.\")\nprint(\"\\nConclusion: The paramagnetic coupling energy is several orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.\")\n```\n\nThe comparison clearly shows that the energy from the Zeeman splitting in a 1T magnetic field is significantly smaller than the energy of a typical electronic transition in the visible spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculations performed are correct. The Python code output confirms the calculated values for the two energies, despite a minor error in the subsequent print statements (which did not affect the core calculation).\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n\n1.  **Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$)**: This is the energy shift due to the Zeeman effect.\n    The formula is $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B$.\n    Using the calculated value from the code:\n    $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n\n2.  **Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**: This is the energy of a photon with the given wavelength.\n    The formula is $\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$.\n    Using the calculated value from the code:\n    $\\Delta E = 2.551 \\text{ eV}$\n\n**Comparison:**\n\nWe compare the two energy values:\n- $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 6 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n- $\\Delta E \\approx 2.5 \\text{ eV}$\n\nClearly, the value of the paramagnetic coupling energy is several orders of magnitude smaller than the atomic transition energy.\nThe ratio is $\\frac{\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} \\approx \\frac{6 \\times 10^{-5}}{2.5} \\approx 2.4 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\nThis signifies that $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$ is *much less than* $\\Delta E$.\n\nTherefore, the correct relationship is $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
