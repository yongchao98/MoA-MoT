    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Mott-Gurney Equation and its context.**\n    The Mott-Gurney equation, $ J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$, describes the current density (J) in a material under a specific set of conditions known as the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. This regime occurs when a voltage (V) is applied across a material, and one of the electrical contacts injects more charge carriers than the material can transport away. This leads to a buildup of \"space charge\" within the material, which in turn limits the current flow.\n\n*   **Step 2: Deconstruct the assumptions behind the Mott-Gurney Law.**\n    To derive this specific form of the equation, several key assumptions must be made:\n    1.  **Single-Carrier Transport:** The current is assumed to be carried by only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes). The contribution from the other type is considered negligible. This is typical for wide-bandgap semiconductors or insulators where one carrier type is much more mobile or easily injected than the other.\n    2.  **Ohmic Contact (No Injection Barrier):** The injecting contact is assumed to be \"Ohmic,\" meaning it can supply an unlimited number of charge carriers into the device. There is no energy barrier to injection, so the contact is not the limiting factor for the current. This ensures that the bulk properties of the material (the space charge) are what limit the current.\n    3.  **Trap-Free Material:** The material is assumed to be a perfect insulator with no electronic trap states within its bandgap. If traps were present, injected carriers would first fill these traps, and the current would follow a different law until the traps are filled (Trap-Filled-Limited SCLC). The simple $J \\propto V^2$ relationship is for the trap-free case.\n    4.  **Drift-Dominated Current (Negligible Diffusion):** The current is assumed to be driven by the electric field (drift current). The current arising from gradients in carrier concentration (diffusion current) is considered negligible. This is a valid assumption for devices that are not too thin and are under a sufficiently high applied voltage.\n    5.  **Negligible Intrinsic Carrier Concentration:** The concentration of thermally generated charge carriers in the material is assumed to be negligible compared to the concentration of injected carriers.\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the given options against these assumptions.**\n\n    *   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   This is incorrect. The model is specifically for a **single-carrier** device.\n\n    *   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   This is incorrect. A Schottky contact, by definition, creates an energy barrier for charge injection, which would limit the current. The Mott-Gurney law requires a non-limiting, or Ohmic, contact.\n\n    *   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   This statement correctly aligns with the key assumptions:\n            *   \"trap-free\": Correct.\n            *   \"single-carrier device\": Correct.\n            *   \"no carrier injection barrier\": Correct (this is equivalent to an Ohmic contact).\n            *   \"negligible diffusion current\": Correct (implying drift-dominated current).\n        *   This option accurately describes the ideal conditions for the Mott-Gurney law.\n\n    *   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n        *   This is incorrect. The current in the SCLC model is precisely the **drift current**. It is the diffusion current that is neglected, not the drift current.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the correct option.**\n    Based on the analysis, option C is the only one that lists all the correct conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
