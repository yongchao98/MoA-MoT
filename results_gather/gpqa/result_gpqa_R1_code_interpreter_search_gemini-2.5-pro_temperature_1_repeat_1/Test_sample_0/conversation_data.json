    "This problem is governed by the energy-time uncertainty principle, a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. The principle states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt), there is an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy (ΔE).\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time is given by the relation:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which corresponds to the lifetime (τ) of the state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n2.  **Relate the Principle to the Problem:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their central energies (|E1 - E2|) must be greater than the spread or uncertainty of those energy levels. A common criterion for resolvability is that the energy separation must be at least on the order of the sum of the energy uncertainties (the linewidths) of the two states, or at a minimum, larger than the wider of the two linewidths.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State:**\n    The energy uncertainty (or linewidth), ΔE, for a state with lifetime τ is calculated as:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n    *   **For the first state (State 1):**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁\n\n    *   **For the second state (State 2):**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** We can use the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of eV·s for a direct result in electron-volts (eV).\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n    The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE₁). This is the dominant factor determining resolvability.\n\n5.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution:** To clearly resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be significantly larger than their energy widths. The minimum separation required is on the order of the larger width, ΔE₁.\n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n    |E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:** We need to find the option that satisfies this condition.\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (This is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV  (This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁴ eV  (This is much larger than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV  (This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n    Only option C provides an energy separation that is substantially larger than the calculated energy uncertainty of the broader state. An energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV would allow the two energy levels to be very clearly distinguished, as it is about 1500 times larger than the required minimum separation.\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculation:\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of State 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of State 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\n\n# The required energy difference to resolve the levels should be greater than the larger uncertainty.\nrequired_separation = delta_E1\nprint(f\"To be resolved, the energy difference must be > {required_separation:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Compare with the options\noptions = {'A': 1e-11, 'B': 1e-9, 'C': 1e-4, 'D': 1e-8}\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_separation:\n        print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference as it is greater than the required separation.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is not large enough.\")\n\n```\nExecution output:\n```\nEnergy uncertainty of State 1 (ΔE1): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy uncertainty of State 2 (ΔE2): 6.582e-08 eV\nTo be resolved, the energy difference must be > 6.582e-07 eV\n\nComparing with options:\nOption A (1.0e-11 eV) is not large enough.\nOption B (1.0e-09 eV) is not large enough.\nOption C (1.0e-04 eV) is a possible energy difference as it is greater than the required separation.\nOption D (1.0e-08 eV) is not large enough.\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
