    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate (CH₂(COOCH₃)₂). In the presence of a base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The p-tolyl group is a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt <=> [CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻ Na⁺ + EtOH`\n    2.  **Michael Addition (Nucleophilic Attack):** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n        `[CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻ + p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃ → (MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH⁻-COOCH₃`\n    3.  **Protonation:** The resulting enolate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final neutral product.\n        `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH⁻-COOCH₃ + EtOH → (MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n*   **Product A Identification:**\n    *   The structure of the product is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this compound as a tricarboxylate derivative of propane, we can consider the three-carbon chain formed by the malonate carbon, the β-carbon, and the α-carbon of the original acrylate.\n        *   Let C1 be the carbon from the malonate, which is attached to two `-COOCH₃` groups.\n        *   Let C2 be the β-carbon, which is attached to the `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   Let C3 be the α-carbon, which is now part of a `-CH₂-COOCH₃` moiety.\n    *   The structure can be seen as `(MeOOC)₂CH(1)-CH(2)(p-tolyl)-CH₂(3)COOCH₃`.\n    *   This is an ester of propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid. The substituent is a `p-tolyl` group at position 2.\n    *   Therefore, the IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are excellent Michael donors. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine system (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n*   **Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    1.  **Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and results in an iminium ion intermediate.\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** The reaction mixture is treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (ketone).\n*   **Product B Identification:**\n    *   The initial addition places the `CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group onto the cyclohexene ring at the position that was β to the nitrogen.\n    *   After hydrolysis, the enamine part reverts to a cyclohexanone. The substituent is at the α-position (C2) relative to the new carbonyl group.\n    *   The product structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at C2.\n    *   To name the product, we can consider it a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is the four-carbon nitrile.\n        *   `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`\n    *   The substituent is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group attached to C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Therefore, the name of the product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative name, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer, which is generally the minor product compared to the more stable keto form after acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants and Product:**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (commonly known as methyl vinyl ketone or MVK), `CH₂=CH-COCH₃`.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Reactant C.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   This is a Michael addition reaction where reactant C acts as the nucleophile. The reaction is done in the presence of base (KOH).\n    *   The product is formed by adding a fragment from the Michael acceptor to the Michael donor. The fragment added from MVK (`CH₂=CH-COCH₃`) to the donor is `-CH₂-CH₂-COCH₃`, which is the `3-oxobutyl` group.\n    *   The product structure shows that this `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to C2 of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n    *   This implies that the Michael donor (reactant C) must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The proton at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione is very acidic because it's located between two carbonyl groups. The base (KOH) deprotonates this carbon to form a highly stabilized enolate, which then attacks the MVK.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis of the three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis set of reactants and products corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
