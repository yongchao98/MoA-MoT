    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Reactant**\n    The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to identify its key features.\n    *   **`cyclohex`**: Indicates a six-membered carbon ring.\n    *   **`-3-ene`**: Indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring, starting at position 3 (between C3 and C4).\n    *   **`carboxylic acid`**: Indicates a -COOH group. As the principal functional group, it is located at position C1.\n    *   **`2-formyl`**: Indicates an aldehyde group (-CHO) at position C2.\n    *   **`5-vinyl`**: Indicates a vinyl group (-CH=CH2) at position C5.\n\n    From this structure, we can identify the features that contribute to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), which is also known as the degree of unsaturation. IHD is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (Ï€) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   One ring (the cyclohexene ring): IHD +1\n    *   One C=C bond in the ring: IHD +1\n    *   One C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group: IHD +1\n    *   One C=O bond in the formyl group: IHD +1\n    *   One C=C bond in the vinyl group: IHD +1\n    *   Total IHD of the reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n    We can also determine the molecular formula to verify this.\n    *   Carbons (C): 6 in the ring + 1 in COOH + 1 in CHO + 2 in vinyl = 10 carbons.\n    *   Hydrogens (H): After drawing the structure and ensuring each carbon has 4 bonds, we find there are 12 hydrogens. (C1(H), C2(H), C3(H), C4(H), C5(H), C6(H2), COOH(H), CHO(H), vinyl(H3)). Total H = 7 (on ring) + 5 (on substituents) = 12.\n    *   Oxygens (O): 2 in COOH + 1 in CHO = 3 oxygens.\n    *   Molecular Formula of reactant: C10H12O3.\n    *   IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - H/2. (Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n    *   IHD(reactant) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5. This confirms the structural analysis.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n    The reagent is red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI). This is a very strong reducing agent. It performs a complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The formyl (aldehyde) group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n    *   Importantly, the carbon-carbon single bonds of the ring are stable and will not be broken. The ring structure is preserved.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\n    The reaction reduces all pi bonds and removes all oxygen atoms, but it does not open the ring.\n    *   The product will be a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   The product will still contain the six-membered ring.\n    *   Since all C=C and C=O bonds are gone, the product will have zero pi bonds.\n\n    We can now calculate the IHD of the product based on its structure.\n    *   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring remains).\n    *   Number of pi bonds = 0 (all have been reduced).\n    *   IHD(product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n*   **Step 4: Verify with the Molecular Formula of the Product**\n    The starting material had a C10 skeleton, which is preserved. The product is therefore a C10 saturated cycloalkane (a substituted cyclohexane). The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CnH2n.\n    *   Since n=10, the molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n    *   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - H/2.\n    *   IHD(product) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\n    Both methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match with the given options**\n    The calculated IHD is 1, which corresponds to option C.\n    A) 0\n    B) 5 (This is the IHD of the reactant)\n    C) 1\n    D) 3\n\n<<<C>>>"
