    "This question requires us to determine which of the given compounds are optically active. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral carbons). However, a molecule with stereocenters can still be achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion (such molecules are called meso compounds).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   A stereocenter is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon atoms:\n        *   C1 is part of a double bond. Not a stereocenter.\n        *   C2 is part of a double bond. Not a stereocenter.\n        *   C3 (in the ethyl group) is a -CH2- group. Not a stereocenter.\n        *   C4 (in the ethyl group) is a -CH3 group. Not a stereocenter.\n        *   The methyl carbon attached to C2 is also not a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. The molecule is essentially planar about the double bond. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself provides the answer. The prefixes `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers (C-3a and C-7a).\n    *   When a compound is named as a specific, single enantiomer (using R/S notation), it is by definition chiral.\n    *   A pure sample of a single enantiomer will always be optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The configuration is given as (2R, 3S). We need to check for internal symmetry.\n    *   Let's draw a conformation (e.g., a Newman projection looking down the C2-C3 bond or a Fischer projection). In a staggered conformation, if we place the COOH groups anti-periplanar, the H on C2 is opposite the CH3 on C3, and the CH3 on C2 is opposite the H on C3. This conformation has a center of inversion. In an eclipsed conformation, the molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond.\n    *   A compound with stereocenters but which is achiral due to a plane of symmetry or center of inversion is a **meso compound**.\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a classic example of a meso compound.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Its mirror image is (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers are enantiomers. They are diastereomers of the meso (2R,3S) form.\n    *   Since (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it lacks internal symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The name includes the `(R)` designation, which specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   Let's verify the source of chirality. The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the `-CH2-CH=` path around the ring, and (4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` path around the ring. These four groups are different.\n    *   Thus, C1 is a chiral center, and the molecule is chiral. The `(R)` specifies one of the two enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation (related to cis/trans) indicates that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's consider the symmetry of this molecule. Imagine the cyclohexane ring is roughly planar. With all three -OH groups pointing up, the molecule has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) perpendicular to the ring. It also has three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH bond and the C4 atom across the ring.\n    *   The presence of these symmetry elements (especially the planes of symmetry) makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The IUPAC name describes a ketone. The parent chain is butan-1-one, where C1 is the carbonyl carbon. A cyclopentyl group is attached to C1, and a methyl group is at C3.\n    *   The structure is: `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`. This can also be written as `(CH3)2CH-CH2-CO-(Cyclopentyl)`.\n    *   Let's search for chiral centers. A chiral center must have four different substituents.\n    *   The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to one H, two identical -CH3 groups, and a `-CH2-` group. It is not a chiral center.\n    *   No other carbon atom in the molecule is bonded to four different groups. The molecule does not have any stereocenters.\n    *   The molecule is flexible due to single bond rotation and lacks overall chirality. It can easily adopt conformations that possess a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-...dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nCounting the optically active compounds, we have 3.\n\n<<<A>>>"
