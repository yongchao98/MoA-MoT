    "*   **Goal:** Determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ and the renormalizability of the theory described by the interaction Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\n*   **Step 1: Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density**\n    In natural units where $\\hbar=c=1$, the action $S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}$ must be a dimensionless quantity. The spacetime volume element $d^4x$ has units of (length)$^4$. Since mass and energy have units of $M^1$, and length has units of $M^{-1}$, the mass dimension of $d^4x$ is $[d^4x]_M = M^{-4}$. For the action $S$ to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of $[\\mathcal{L}]_M = M^4$.\n\n*   **Step 2: Mass Dimension of the Fields**\n    We can deduce the mass dimensions of the fields from their kinetic terms in the full Lagrangian.\n    1.  **Fermion field $\\psi$**: The kinetic term for a fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Dirac}} \\supset \\bar{\\psi} i \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi$.\n        *   We know $[\\mathcal{L}]_M = M^4$.\n        *   The derivative operator $\\partial_\\mu$ has the dimension of momentum, so $[\\partial_\\mu]_M = M^1$.\n        *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless.\n        *   Therefore, the dimensions must satisfy $[\\bar{\\psi}\\psi]_M [\\partial_\\mu]_M = M^4$.\n        *   Since $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M = [\\psi]_M$, we have $[\\psi]_M^2 \\cdot M^1 = M^4$, which leads to $[\\psi]_M^2 = M^3$.\n        *   Thus, the mass dimension of the fermion field is $[\\psi]_M = M^{3/2}$.\n\n    2.  **Field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{EM}} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n        *   Again, we must have $[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{EM}}]_M = M^4$.\n        *   This implies $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M^2 = M^4$.\n        *   Thus, the mass dimension of the field strength tensor is $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = M^2$.\n\n*   **Step 3: Mass Dimension of $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$**\n    The tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}\\right]$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless constant matrices.\n    *   Their commutator is therefore also a dimensionless matrix.\n    *   So, $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = M^0$.\n\n*   **Step 4: Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant $\\kappa$**\n    Now we can analyze the interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$. This term, being part of the Lagrangian density, must also have a mass dimension of $M^4$.\n    *   $[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M [\\bar{\\psi}]_M [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M [\\psi]_M [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = M^4$.\n    *   Substituting the dimensions we found:\n        $[\\kappa]_M \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^0) \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^2) = M^4$.\n    *   Combining the powers of M:\n        $[\\kappa]_M \\cdot M^{3/2 + 3/2 + 2} = M^4$.\n        $[\\kappa]_M \\cdot M^{3 + 2} = M^4$.\n        $[\\kappa]_M \\cdot M^5 = M^4$.\n    *   Solving for $[\\kappa]_M$:\n        $[\\kappa]_M = M^{4-5} = M^{-1}$.\n\n*   **Step 5: Renormalizability of the Theory**\n    The renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants (this is known as power-counting renormalizability).\n    *   If a coupling constant has a mass dimension of zero (dimensionless), the theory is typically renormalizable (e.g., the electric charge 'e' in QED).\n    *   If a coupling constant has a positive mass dimension, the theory is super-renormalizable.\n    *   If a coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable. Higher-order loop corrections in such a theory would generate divergences that require an infinite number of new counter-terms, making the theory lose its predictive power at high energies.\n\n    Since we found that $[\\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative, the theory described by this interaction is **not renormalizable**.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    The mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
