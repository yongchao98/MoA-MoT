    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Reactant:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule where the carbon at position 1 is attached to a bromine atom (Br), and the carbon at position 2 is attached to a deuterium atom (d). The other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are attached to hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   **Reagents:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) from NaNH2 acts as a base and removes a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n    *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Position C2, which has a deuterium atom (d).\n\n    Because there are two different atoms (H and D) at the ortho positions, two different elimination pathways are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n        2.  The resulting electron pair forms a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n        3.  The bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom is unaffected and remains at position C2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. (Note: If we number the triple bond as C1-C2, the deuterium is at C3).\n\n        ```\n           Br              (triple bond)\n          / \\               /     \\\n        (d)C--C(H)  -H⁺   (d)C-------C\n         ||  ||   ----->    ||       ||\n        (H)C--C(H)  -Br⁻    (H)C-------C(H)\n          \\ /                 \\     /\n           C(H)                  C(H)\n        (Reactant)       (Benzyne Intermediate A: 3-deuterobenzyne)\n        ```\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron (d⁺) from C2. (Note: This is slower than removing a proton due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still a possible pathway).\n        2.  The resulting electron pair forms a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n        3.  The bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n        ```\n           Br              (triple bond)\n          / \\               /     \\\n        (d)C--C(H)  -d⁺   (H)C-------C(H)\n         ||  ||   ----->    ||       ||\n        (H)C--C(H)  -Br⁻    (H)C-------C(H)\n          \\ /                 \\     /\n           C(H)                  C(H)\n        (Reactant)       (Benzyne Intermediate B: benzyne)\n        ```\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two sp-hybridized carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n    *   **Products from Benzyne A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. Attack can occur at either C1 or C6.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the #1 position, the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        So, Pathway A leads to two different products.\n\n    *   **Products from Benzyne B (benzyne):**\n        This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack at C1 or C2 leads to the same carbanion intermediate, which upon protonation gives the same final product.\n        *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The -NH2 group adds to one carbon of the triple bond, and the other carbon is protonated. The final product is simply **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        So, Pathway B leads to one product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Total Number of Possible Products**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products can be formed:\n    1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n    2.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n    3.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
