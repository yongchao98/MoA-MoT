    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a second peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ and M+2 pattern, with a ratio of approximately 100:32 (or ~3:1), is a distinctive signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom. Chlorine has two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl (75.8% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (24.2% abundance), which results in this characteristic peak ratio.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This is a very characteristic, broad absorption band that strongly indicates the presence of an O-H bond involved in hydrogen bonding. The extreme broadness is the hallmark of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of a C=O double bond stretch. The position at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This eliminates option **D) Phenyl chloroformate**, which is an ester and would lack the broad O-H peak.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is a singlet (s) integrating to one proton (1H). Its chemical shift is far downfield, which is highly characteristic of an acidic proton from a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   They are both doublets (d), meaning each set of protons is coupled to only one neighboring proton.\n    *   They each integrate to two protons (2H), for a total of four aromatic protons.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic indicator of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted)** benzene ring. This substitution pattern creates a high degree of symmetry, where the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent to the two on the other side.\n\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule has a carboxylic acid group and a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring, which would produce a more complex ¹H NMR spectrum with three distinct aromatic signals, not two doublets. It also lacks a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MW:** C₇H₅ClO₂ has a molecular weight of 156.5 g/mol (using ³⁵Cl), which matches the MS data.\n    *   **Functional Groups:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR data.\n    *   **Substitution:** It has a para- (1,4-) substitution pattern, which perfectly explains the ¹H NMR signals (two doublets of 2H each). The carboxylic acid proton explains the singlet at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho- (1,2-) disubstituted ring. This would result in four unique aromatic protons and a much more complex ¹H NMR splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester, not a carboxylic acid, and is inconsistent with the IR and ¹H NMR data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only structure that is consistent with all the provided spectral data (MS, IR, and ¹H NMR) is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
