    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is the electrophilic nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH3) is an ortho-, para-directing group. The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to steric hindrance, the para isomer is the major product.\n*   **Product 1:** 4-nitrotoluene.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (4-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO2) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an oxidation reaction. MnO2 is a specific oxidizing agent that oxidizes benzylic C-H bonds. While very strong oxidizing agents (like KMnO4) would oxidize the methyl group to a carboxylic acid, the use of MnO2 typically results in the oxidation of a benzylic methyl group to an aldehyde.\n*   **Product 2:** 4-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (4-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH3)2CO) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The aldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde) has no α-hydrogens and cannot form an enolate. Acetone has α-hydrogens and will be deprotonated by the NaOH base to form an enolate ion (`⁻CH₂COCH₃`). This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting β-hydroxy ketone intermediate readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The trans (E) isomer is the major product due to greater thermodynamic stability.\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The structure is O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CO-CH₃.\n\n**Step 4: Determination of the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n*   **Molecule:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    1.  The molecule has an extended conjugated system involving the p-nitrophenyl ring, the C=C double bond, and the C=O double bond. To maximize orbital overlap, all the atoms in this conjugated backbone (the C and N atoms of the p-nitrophenyl group, the vinylic carbons, the carbonyl carbon, and the carbonyl oxygen) tend to be coplanar.\n    2.  Let's consider this plane of conjugation as a potential plane of symmetry.\n    3.  The two oxygen atoms of the nitro group can lie in this plane. The hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring and the vinyl group also lie in this plane.\n    4.  The methyl group (-CH₃) is attached to the carbonyl carbon. The C-CH₃ bond allows for free rotation. It is possible for the methyl group to adopt a conformation where one of its C-H bonds lies in the molecular plane. In this case, the other two hydrogen atoms are located symmetrically, one above and one below the plane.\n    5.  With this conformation, the entire molecule possesses a single plane of symmetry (σ), which is the plane containing the conjugated backbone.\n    6.  We check for other symmetry elements:\n        *   **Rotation axis (Cn):** There is no C₂, C₃, or other rotational axis. The nitro group on one end and the acetyl group on the other end are different.\n        *   **Inversion center (i):** There is no center of inversion.\n        *   **Improper rotation axis (Sn):** There is no improper rotation axis.\n*   **Conclusion:** The only symmetry elements present are the identity element (E) and a single plane of reflection (σ). A molecule with this set of symmetry elements belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) C3\nB) Cs\nC) D2h\nD) C2h\n\nThe correct point group is Cs.\n\n<<<B>>>"
