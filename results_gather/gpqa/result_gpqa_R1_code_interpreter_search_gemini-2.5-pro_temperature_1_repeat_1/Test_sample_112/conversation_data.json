    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic feature. A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ region is the classic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding (dimerization). While alcohols also have a broad O-H peak, it is typically centered higher (around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹) and is usually less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the C=O group of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the molecule is also an alkene (i.e., it is unsaturated).\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n\n*   **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene, supporting the conclusion from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n**3. Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial clue. We need to identify a common chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45.\n    *   Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺:\n        *   Mass = (1 × Mass of C) + (2 × Mass of O) + (1 × Mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   The fragment at m/z = 45 is a very common and diagnostically important fragment for carboxylic acids.\n\n**4. Synthesize All Evidence and Determine the Formula:**\n\n*   The evidence from all three techniques points towards the molecule being an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n*   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options C (C₆H₁₀O) and D (C₆H₁₂O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n*   We are left with two possibilities: **C₆H₁₀O₂** and **C₆H₁₂O₂**.\n*   To decide between these two, we use the concept of the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   DoU Formula = C + 1 - (H/2)\n*   From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must contain:\n    1.  One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid). This accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    2.  One C=C double bond (from the alkene group). This accounts for a **second** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct formula must have a total DoU of at least 2.\n*   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n    *   **For C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This perfectly matches our required two degrees of unsaturation.\n    *   **For C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula only accounts for the C=O bond of a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid) and contradicts the clear evidence for a C=C double bond from both FTIR and NMR.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. It must contain two oxygen atoms and have at least two degrees of unsaturation. Only the formula C₆H₁₀O₂ fits all the experimental data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
