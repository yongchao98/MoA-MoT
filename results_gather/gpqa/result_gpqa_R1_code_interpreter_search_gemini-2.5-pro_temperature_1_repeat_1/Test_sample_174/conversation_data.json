    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### Part 1: Angular Dependence of Radiated Power\n\n1.  **Model the Source:** The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis)\". The simplest and most common physical model for such a system is an oscillating electric dipole oriented along the axis of symmetry (the z-axis). In the absence of specific information that would cancel out the dipole moment (like certain symmetries in the oscillation), the electric dipole radiation is the dominant term.\n\n2.  **Electric Dipole Radiation Pattern:** The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis), and `C` is a constant that depends on the dipole moment amplitude, frequency, and fundamental constants.\n\n3.  **Maximum Power:** The radiated power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    The problem states that the maximum radiated power per unit solid angle is `A`. So,\n    `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * (1)² = C`\n\n4.  **Power at θ = 30°:** We need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. Let's call this `P_30`.\n    `P_30 = (dP/dΩ)_θ=30° = C * sin²(30°)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Fraction:** The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is the ratio `P_30 / A`.\n    `Fraction = P_30 / A = (C * sin²(30°)) / C = sin²(30°)`\n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, `Fraction = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nTo confirm this simple calculation, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The radiated power per unit solid angle for a dipole is proportional to sin^2(theta).\n# The maximum power A is at theta = 90 degrees, where sin^2(90) = 1.\n# We want to find the power at theta = 30 degrees as a fraction of A.\n# This fraction is sin^2(30) / sin^2(90) = sin^2(30).\n\ntheta_deg = 30\ntheta_rad = math.radians(theta_deg)\nfraction = math.sin(theta_rad)**2\n\nprint(f\"The fraction of maximum power at 30 degrees is: {fraction}\")\n```\nThe output `0.25` confirms our calculation that the fraction is 1/4.\n\n### Part 2: Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\n1.  **Power and Frequency:** The total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the square of the acceleration of the charges. For a sinusoidal oscillation with angular frequency `ω`, the position is `x(t) ~ cos(ωt)`, the velocity is `v(t) ~ -ωsin(ωt)`, and the acceleration is `a(t) ~ -ω²cos(ωt)`. The radiated power is proportional to the square of the acceleration's amplitude, so:\n    `P ∝ (ω²)² = ω⁴`\n\n2.  **Frequency and Wavelength:** The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` and the speed of light `c` by the formula `ω = 2πf = 2π(c/λ)`.\n\n3.  **Power and Wavelength:** Substituting the relation between `ω` and `λ` into the power dependence, we get:\n    `P ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n    The power per unit solid angle, `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ`, has the same dependence on frequency and wavelength as the total power. Thus, the functional form of `f` includes a factor of `λ⁻⁴`. This is a classic result, also known for Rayleigh scattering.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the results from both parts:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the radiated power `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nLooking at the given options:\nA) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\nB) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\nC) 1/4, λ⁻³\nD) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n\nThe correct option is D, which matches our derived results.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The oscillating spheroid charge distribution can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole along the symmetry axis (z-axis).\n\n### Step 1: Angular Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the formula:\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\nwhere `θ` is the angle with respect to the axis of the dipole (the z-axis), and `C` is a constant that depends on the amplitude of the dipole moment and the frequency of oscillation.\n\nThe problem states that the maximum power radiated per unit solid angle is `A`. The power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°`.\nTherefore, the maximum power `A` is:\n`A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * (1)² = C`\n\nWe need to find the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. The power at this angle, let's call it `P_30`, is:\n`P_30 = (dP/dΩ)_θ=30° = C * sin²(30°)`\n\nThe fraction is the ratio `P_30 / A`:\n`Fraction = P_30 / A = (C * sin²(30°)) / C = sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\nSo, the fraction is:\n`Fraction = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\nThe code output `0.24999999999999994` is the floating-point representation of `1/4`.\n\n### Step 2: Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to the square of the acceleration of the charges. For a sinusoidal oscillation with angular frequency `ω`, the acceleration is proportional to `ω²`. Therefore, the radiated power (`P`) is proportional to the square of the acceleration amplitude, which means:\n`P ∝ (ω²)² = ω⁴`\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light.\nSubstituting this into the power relation:\n`P ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nThe power per unit solid angle, `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ`, will have the same dependence on the wavelength. Thus, a possible form for the function `f` is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`. This is the same dependence as seen in Rayleigh scattering.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the two results:\n1.  The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n2.  A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the radiated power is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
