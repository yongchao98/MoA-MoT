    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to determine the enthalpy of formation of the given compound.\n\n### **1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's analyze the structure to count the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe structure can be drawn as:\n```\n      CH3   CH3\n      |     |\nCH3 - C = CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C - CH3\n      |\n      CH3\n```\n-   **Carbon (C) atoms:**\n    -   2 from (CH3)2\n    -   1 from C=\n    -   1 from =CH-\n    -   1 from -CH2-\n    -   1 from -CH(CH3)-\n    -   1 from the CH3 in CH(CH3)\n    -   1 from the second -CH2-\n    -   1 from -CH=\n    -   1 from =C(CH3)2\n    -   2 from the second (CH3)2\n    -   Total Carbon atoms = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 12 atoms.\n\n-   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:**\n    -   6 from (CH3)2\n    -   1 from =CH-\n    -   2 from -CH2-\n    -   1 from -CH(CH3)-\n    -   3 from the CH3 in CH(CH3)\n    -   2 from the second -CH2-\n    -   1 from -CH=\n    -   6 from the second (CH3)2\n    -   Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound. We need to count the number of each type of bond.\n\n-   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n-   **C=C double bonds:** There are two double bonds in the structure: (CH3)2**C=C**H- and -**CH=C**(CH3)2. So, there are **2** C=C bonds.\n-   **C-C single bonds:**\n    -   To find the number of C-C bonds, we can use the total bond count. For an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, the total number of bonds is (Total Atoms) - 1.\n    -   Total atoms = 12 (C) + 22 (H) = 34.\n    -   Total bonds = 34 - 1 = 33.\n    -   Number of C-C bonds = Total bonds - (C-H bonds) - (C=C bonds)\n    -   Number of C-C bonds = 33 - 22 - 2 = **9**.\n\nNow, we calculate the enthalpy of atomization of C12H22 (ΔH_atom, compound) using the given bond energies:\n-   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n-   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n-   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n\nTotal ΔH_atom, compound = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\n\nThe formation of C12H22 involves starting from the elements in their standard states: 12 moles of Carbon (as graphite, C(s)) and 11 moles of Hydrogen gas (H2(g)).\n\n-   **For Carbon:** The enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol.\n    -   Energy to atomize 12 moles of C = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = **12000 kJ**.\n-   **For Hydrogen:** The bond energy of H-H is given as 100 kJ/mol. This is the energy to break 1 mole of H2 into 2 moles of H atoms. We need 22 moles of H atoms, which come from 11 moles of H2.\n    -   Energy to atomize 11 moles of H2 = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = **1100 kJ**.\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization of the elements (ΔH_atom, elements) = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy released when the compound is formed from its atoms (which is equal to the enthalpy of atomization of the compound).\n\nΔH_f = (ΔH_atom, elements) - (ΔH_atom, compound)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n### **5. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options include answers in kJ/g. Let's convert our result to these units. We need the molar mass of C12H22.\n-   Molar mass of C ≈ 12 g/mol\n-   Molar mass of H ≈ 1 g/mol\n-   Molar mass of C12H22 = (12 * 12) + (22 * 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\nΔH_f (per gram) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.446 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\nLet's use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n```python\n# Given values\nenthalpy_atom_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_HH = 100    # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CC = 200    # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CC_double = 300  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CH = 400    # kJ/mol\n\n# Molecular formula: C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Number of bonds\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\nnum_CC_double_bonds = 2\nnum_CC_bonds = 9  # Total bonds (12+22-1) - num_CH - num_CC_double = 33 - 22 - 2 = 9\n\n# 1. Calculate enthalpy of atomization of the compound\nenthalpy_atom_compound = (num_CH_bonds * bond_energy_CH) + \\\n                         (num_CC_bonds * bond_energy_CC) + \\\n                         (num_CC_double_bonds * bond_energy_CC_double)\n\n# 2. Calculate enthalpy of atomization of the elements\n# For C12H22, we need 12 C(g) and 22 H(g)\n# This comes from 12 C(graphite) and 11 H2(g)\nnum_H2_molecules = num_H / 2\nenthalpy_atom_elements = (num_C * enthalpy_atom_C) + (num_H2_molecules * bond_energy_HH)\n\n# 3. Calculate enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\nenthalpy_formation_mol = enthalpy_atom_elements - enthalpy_atom_compound\n\n# 4. Convert to kJ/g\nmolar_mass_C = 12.011\nmolar_mass_H = 1.008\nmolar_mass_compound = (num_C * molar_mass_C) + (num_H * molar_mass_H)\n\nenthalpy_formation_gram = enthalpy_formation_mol / molar_mass_compound\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): {enthalpy_formation_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Molar mass (g/mol): {molar_mass_compound}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): {enthalpy_formation_gram}\")\n\n```\nEnthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0\nMolar mass (g/mol): 166.308\nEnthalpy of formation (kJ/g): 11.424536259042562\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 11.44 kJ/g, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",

(The slight difference is due to using more precise atomic masses in the code).\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 11.44 kJ/g matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
