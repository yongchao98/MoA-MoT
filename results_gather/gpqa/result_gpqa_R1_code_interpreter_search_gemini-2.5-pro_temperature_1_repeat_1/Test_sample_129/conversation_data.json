    "The user wants to find the minimum redshift for a Lyman-alpha absorption line to be observable with a ground-based optical telescope.\n\n1.  **Identify the rest wavelength:** The Lyman-alpha (Lyα) transition of neutral hydrogen has a rest wavelength (λ_rest) of approximately 1216 Å. This is in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum.\n\n2.  **Identify the observational constraint:** Ground-based telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs most UV radiation. The atmosphere becomes transparent to electromagnetic radiation at a wavelength of about 3600 Å. This is known as the atmospheric cutoff. Therefore, to be detected from the ground, the light from the quasar must have a wavelength (λ_observed) greater than this cutoff.\n    *   λ_observed > 3600 Å\n\n3.  **Relate observed wavelength to redshift:** The redshift (z) relates the rest wavelength (λ_rest) to the observed wavelength (λ_observed) by the formula:\n    *   λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)\n\n4.  **Set up the inequality and solve for the minimum redshift:** We need to find the minimum redshift 'z' for which the observed wavelength of the Lyα line is just at the atmospheric cutoff.\n    *   λ_rest * (1 + z) > 3600 Å\n    *   1216 Å * (1 + z) > 3600 Å\n    *   1 + z > 3600 / 1216\n    *   1 + z > 2.96\n    *   z > 2.96 - 1\n    *   z > 1.96\n\n5.  **Compare with the options:** The lower limit on the redshift must be greater than 1.96.\n    *   A) 1.2\n    *   B) 3\n    *   C) 2.4\n    *   D) 1.9\n\n    The closest value that satisfies the condition z > 1.96 is 3. An object with a redshift of 1.9 would be right at the edge of detectability and likely too attenuated by the atmosphere to be observed well. An object with a redshift of 2.4 would be observable, but the question asks for the *lower limit* required for detection, which is represented by the options provided. Among the choices, the one that ensures clear detectability above the atmospheric cutoff is the next highest discrete value available, which implies a practical limit. However, the calculation shows the theoretical lower limit is z ~ 1.96. The closest answer choice is 1.9. But looking at the choices, a redshift of 3 would place the line at ~4864 Å, well within the optical band. A redshift of 2.4 places it at ~4134 Å, also well within. A redshift of 1.9 places it at ~3526 Å, which is right at the atmospheric cutoff and would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to observe. Therefore, a slightly higher redshift is practically necessary. Let's re-examine the question's phrasing \"lower limit ... such that they can be detected\". This implies a practical limit, not just the mathematical one. Often, a slightly higher buffer is considered for practical astronomy. However, if we strictly interpret \"lower limit\", 1.96 is the number. Let's re-evaluate the choices based on this. 1.9 is the closest choice to 1.96 from below, but the redshift must be *greater* than 1.96. The choice that represents the effective lower bound from the given options is 2.4 or perhaps 1.9 is intended to be the rounded-down answer.\n\nLet's do the calculation with a slightly more conservative atmospheric cutoff, say 3800 Å, which is sometimes used as a practical limit for the blue end of the optical spectrum.\nz > (3800 / 1216) - 1\nz > 3.125 - 1\nz > 2.125\n\nWith this more realistic cutoff, a redshift of 1.9 is too low, and 2.4 becomes a very plausible lower limit.\n\nLet's assume the question intended the standard atmospheric cutoff of ~3600 Å.\nz > 1.96.\nThe question asks for the lower limit. Of the options provided, the smallest redshift that is comfortably *above* this limit is 2.4. A redshift of 1.9 would put the observed wavelength at 1216 * (1 + 1.9) = 3526.4 Å, which is below the 3600 Å cutoff and thus not detectable. A redshift of 2.4 would put the line at 1216 * (1 + 2.4) = 4134.4 Å, which is clearly detectable. Therefore, to be detectable, the redshift must be at least the value that puts it into the observable window. The first option that does this is 2.4.\n\nLet's re-verify the cutoff. The ultraviolet is typically defined as ending at 4000 Å (400 nm), and the atmospheric cutoff is often cited as being around 320 nm (3200 Å) to 400 nm (4000 Å), depending on conditions. Using 4000 Å as a firm limit for the beginning of the optical window:\nz > (4000 / 1216) - 1\nz > 3.28 - 1\nz > 2.28\n\nIn this case, 2.4 is the first option that clearly exceeds this limit. Therefore, 2.4 is the most reasonable answer for a practical lower limit for ground-based observation.\n\nFinal check:\n- λ_rest = 1216 Å\n- λ_observed > ~3800 Å (practical atmospheric cutoff)\n- z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\n- z_min = (3800 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 2.125\n\nThe redshift must be greater than ~2.1. Of the choices given, the most appropriate lower limit is 2.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
