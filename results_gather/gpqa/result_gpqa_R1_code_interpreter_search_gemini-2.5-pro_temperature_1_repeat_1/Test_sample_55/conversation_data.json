    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Process:** The problem describes a decay from the hydrogen atom state |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> through a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This means it's a cascade decay:\n    |3,0,0> → intermediate state → |1,0,0>\n\n2.  **Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions:**\n    For a transition from an initial state |n, l, m> to a final state |n', l', m'>, the following rules must be satisfied:\n    *   **Parity change:** The parity of the state, given by (-1)^l, must change. This implies that Δl = l' - l must be an odd integer. For one-photon E1 transitions, this simplifies to Δl = ±1.\n    *   **Angular momentum projection:** The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = m' - m, must be 0 or ±1. (Δm = 0 corresponds to a π-polarized photon, and Δm = ±1 corresponds to σ±-polarized photons).\n    *   **Principal quantum number:** The change in the principal quantum number, Δn, can be any integer, but for decay (spontaneous emission), we must have E_initial > E_final, which generally means n_initial > n_final.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State(s):**\n    *   **First transition:** from |i> = |3, 0, 0> to |int>.\n        *   l_i = 0. According to the Δl = ±1 rule, the intermediate state must have l_int = 1.\n        *   m_i = 0. According to the Δm = 0, ±1 rule, the intermediate state can have m_int = 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   The problem implies the cascade goes via the n=2 shell, so the intermediate states are of the form |2, 1, m_int>.\n    *   **Second transition:** from |int> = |2, 1, m_int> to |f> = |1, 0, 0>.\n        *   l_int = 1. The final state has l_f = 0. The change is Δl = 0 - 1 = -1, which is allowed.\n        *   m_f = 0. The change is Δm = 0 - m_int. For this to be allowed (Δm = 0, ±1), the initial m_int must be 0, +1, or -1. This is consistent with our finding for the first transition.\n\n    Therefore, there are three possible cascade routes, distinguished by the magnetic quantum number of the intermediate |2,1,m> state:\n    *   **Path -1:** |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n    *   **Path 0:**  |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n    *   **Path +1:** |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of Each Route:**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. In the context of branching processes, this is the branching ratio for that specific path. The probability of a cascade path is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n    P(path m) = BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m>) × BR(|2,1,m> → |1,0,0>)\n\n    *   **Step 1: Branching Ratio for |3,0,0> → |2,1,m>**\n        The initial state |3,0,0> (a 3s state) is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transitions to the three degenerate sublevels |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1> are equally probable.\n        Let Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m>) be the transition rate to a specific sublevel m. Due to rotational symmetry:\n        Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>)\n        Let's call this rate Γ₀.\n        The total decay rate of the |3,0,0> state is the sum of the rates to all possible final states. The only allowed E1 decay from 3s is to a 2p state (since 1p does not exist).\n        Γ_total(|3,0,0>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) + Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) + Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 3Γ₀\n        The branching ratio for the transition into a specific sublevel 'm' is:\n        BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m>) = Γ₀ / (3Γ₀) = 1/3.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Branching Ratio for |2,1,m> → |1,0,0>**\n        Once the atom is in a state |2,1,m> (a 2p state), it will decay. The only energetically lower state it can decay to via an E1 transition is the |1,0,0> state (1s), as Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 is allowed. There are no other allowed E1 decay channels.\n        Therefore, the probability of a |2,1,m> state decaying to |1,0,0> is 1.\n        BR(|2,1,m> → |1,0,0>) = 1.\n\n    *   **Overall Probability for a Specific Path:**\n        P(path m) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Each of the three possible cascade routes has a probability of 1/3. Now we check the given options:\n    A) |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0> and 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\n    B) |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0> and 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\n    C) |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> and 1/3. (Correct route and probability)\n    D) |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> and 2/3. (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe only option that provides a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability is C.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
