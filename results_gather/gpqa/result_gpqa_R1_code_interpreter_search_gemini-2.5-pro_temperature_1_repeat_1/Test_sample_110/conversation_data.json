    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This reaction involves a ketone, a strong base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK), and an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate). This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate. The enolate will act as the nucleophile.\n    *   Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt) is the Michael acceptor and acts as the electrophile.\n\n3.  **Determine the site of deprotonation (enolate formation):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Let's examine the α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group at C1):\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-hydrogens**.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, C1, and C5. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-hydrogen**.\n    *   Since only the C6 position has an α-hydrogen, the strong base (t-BuOK) must abstract this proton to form the enolate. The negative charge will be delocalized between C6 and the carbonyl oxygen.\n\n4.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate formed acts as a nucleophile, with the electron density concentrated on the C6 carbon.\n    *   This C6 nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the carbon further from the ester group).\n    *   `Enolate (from C6) + CH₂=CH-COOEt → New C-C bond between C6 and the β-carbon (CH₂)`\n    *   The intermediate formed is then protonated (typically by the solvent, t-BuOH, or during aqueous workup) to give the final product.\n\n5.  **Determine the structure and name of Product A:**\n    *   The original cyclohexanone ring remains intact. A new substituent is added to the C6 position.\n    *   The new substituent is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n    *   The product structure is the 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one skeleton with a `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group attached at C6.\n    *   To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we treat the ethyl propanoate as the parent chain. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate.\n    *   Let's name the cyclohexyl substituent. The attachment point to the main chain is designated as C1' of the substituent ring. The principal functional group on the ring (the keto group) should get the lowest possible number.\n        *   C1' is the original C6 of the ketone. It has a methyl group.\n        *   Numbering from C1' towards the keto group gives the keto group position C2'. The original C1 of the ketone is now C2' of the substituent.\n        *   The original C2 of the ketone is now C3' of the substituent. It has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   So, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of the product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is also a Michael addition. The nucleophile is a nitronate anion, formed from a nitroalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   **Nucleophile:** The base, KOH, deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂C**H₂**NO₂). Protons on this carbon are acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nitro group. The resulting carbanion (nitronate ion) is the nucleophile: `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n    *   **Electrophile:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as crotononitrile, is the Michael acceptor.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (the carbon of the double bond that is further from the nitrile group).\n    *   `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻ + CH₃-CH=CH-CN → New C-C bond between the α-carbon of the nitroalkane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.`\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure and name of Product B:**\n    *   The new bond forms between the `CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃` group and the `CH(CH₃)` group of the original nitrile.\n    *   The product structure is:\n        ```\n              NO₂\n              |\n        CH₃-CH₂-CH -- CH-CH₂-CN\n                       |\n                       CH₃\n        ```\n    *   To name this product, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (C1).\n    *   The longest chain is six carbons long: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The parent alkane is hexane, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We identify and number the substituents on this chain:\n        *   A **methyl** group is on C3.\n        *   A **nitro** group is on C4.\n    *   Combining these parts, the full IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n\nThe calculated products for both reactions match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
