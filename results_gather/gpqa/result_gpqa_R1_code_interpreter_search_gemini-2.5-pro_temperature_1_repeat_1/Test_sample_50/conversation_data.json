    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\nWe need to find the total potential energy of a system composed of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere. A \"grounded\" sphere means its electric potential is maintained at zero (V=0). The charge `q` will induce charges on the surface of the sphere. The potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble this configuration, specifically, the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to a distance `d` from the sphere's center.\n\n### 2. Method of Images\nThis problem is a classic application of the \"method of images\". This powerful technique allows us to replace the complex problem of a charge and a conductor with a simpler problem involving only point charges that replicate the electric field in the region of interest (outside the sphere).\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the electric field and potential outside the sphere can be perfectly mimicked by:\n1.  The original charge `q` at distance `d`.\n2.  An \"image charge\" `q'` placed *inside* the sphere.\n\nThe magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at a distance R from the center) is zero. The standard results for this configuration are:\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d` (measured from the center, on the line connecting the center to `q`)\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\nThere are two common ways to calculate the potential energy of this system.\n\n#### Method A: Using the Work Integral\nThe potential energy `U` is the work `W` done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. The work is done against the electric force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere.\n`U = - ∫_∞^d F_electric · dr`\n\nThe force on charge `q` due to the sphere is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`. Let's say `q` is moved along the x-axis from `x = ∞` to `x = d`. The force on `q` when it is at a position `x` is:\n`F(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)^2`\nThe image charge `q'` at this point is `-qR/x` and its position is `R^2/x`. The distance between them is `x - R^2/x`.\n`F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nThe force is attractive (negative sign). The work done by the electric field is `W_field = ∫_∞^d F(x) dx`. The potential energy is `U = -W_field`.\n`U = - ∫_∞^d [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = k * q^2 * R ∫_∞^d x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\nUsing substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, `du = 2x dx`:\n`∫ x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx = (1/2) ∫ u^-2 du = -1 / (2u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, evaluate the definite integral:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))]` from `∞` to `d`.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞)))]`\n`U = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))`\n\n#### Method B: Using the General Energy Formula\nA more direct method uses the general formula for the electrostatic energy of a system of charges and conductors:\n`U = (1/2) * Σ q_i * V_i`\nwhere `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` created by all *other* charges in the system.\n\nFor our system, we have the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere, which has a total induced charge `Q_induced`.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q + (1/2) * Q_induced * V_sphere`\n\n1.  Since the sphere is grounded, `V_sphere = 0`. So the second term is zero.\n2.  `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere.\n\nThe beauty of the method of images is that this potential, `V_at_q`, is exactly the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n*   Location of `q` is `d`.\n*   Image charge `q' = -qR/d` is at `b = R^2/d`.\n*   Distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n\nThe potential at `d` due to `q'` is:\n`V_at_q = k * q' / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_at_q = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nBoth methods yield the same result. The potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
