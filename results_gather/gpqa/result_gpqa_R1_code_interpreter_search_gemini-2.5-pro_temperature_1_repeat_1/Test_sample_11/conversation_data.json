    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process and conservation laws:**\n    The problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion ($Pi^+$) into a positive muon ($mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($nu$). The decay is represented as:\n    $Pi^+ \\rightarrow mu^+ + \\nu$\n\n    Since the pion is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. The fundamental principles of physics that govern this decay are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum.\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   Initial momentum ($p_{initial}$) = Momentum of stationary $Pi^+$ = 0.\n    *   Final momentum ($p_{final}$) = Momentum of $mu^+$ ($p_{mu}$) + Momentum of $nu$ ($p_{nu}$).\n    *   According to the conservation of momentum, $p_{initial} = p_{final}$.\n    *   Therefore, $0 = \\vec{p}_{mu} + \\vec{p}_{nu}$, which implies $\\vec{p}_{mu} = -\\vec{p}_{nu}$.\n    *   This means the muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude 'p', so $p = |\\vec{p}_{mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{nu}|$.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   Initial energy ($E_{initial}$) = Rest mass energy of the stationary $Pi^+ = m_{Pi}c^2$.\n    *   Final energy ($E_{final}$) = Total energy of the $mu^+$ ($E_{mu}$) + Total energy of the $nu$ ($E_{nu}$).\n    *   According to the conservation of energy, $E_{initial} = E_{final}$.\n    *   $m_{Pi}c^2 = E_{mu} + E_{nu}$.\n\n4.  **Use Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relations:**\n    *   The total energy of a particle is given by $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}$.\n    *   For the muon ($mu^+$), which is a massive particle: $E_{mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2}$.\n    *   The kinetic energy of the muon is $KE_{mu} = E_{mu} - m_{mu}c^2$.\n    *   For the neutrino ($nu$), we assume it is massless ($m_{nu} = 0$). Its energy is therefore $E_{nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0} = pc$. The kinetic energy of a massless particle is equal to its total energy, so $KE_{nu} = E_{nu} = pc$.\n\n5.  **Derive the Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   Substitute the energy expressions back into the energy conservation equation:\n        $m_{Pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n    *   Rearrange to solve for `pc`:\n        $m_{Pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $(m_{Pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2$\n        $(m_{Pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{Pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2$\n    *   Simplify by canceling $(pc)^2$ from both sides:\n        $(m_{Pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{Pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{mu}c^2)^2$\n    *   Solve for `pc`, which is the kinetic energy of the neutrino ($KE_{nu}$):\n        $2(m_{Pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{Pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{mu}c^2)^2$\n        $pc = KE_{nu} = \\frac{(m_{Pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{mu}c^2)^2}{2m_{Pi}c^2}$\n\n    *   The total energy released in the decay (Q-value) is converted into the kinetic energies of the products:\n        $Q = m_{Pi}c^2 - m_{mu}c^2 = KE_{mu} + KE_{nu}$\n    *   We can find the kinetic energy of the muon ($KE_{mu}$) using this relation:\n        $KE_{mu} = Q - KE_{nu} = (m_{Pi}c^2 - m_{mu}c^2) - KE_{nu}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Values:**\n    *   Given values:\n        Rest mass energy of $Pi^+$ ($m_{Pi}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV\n        Rest mass energy of $mu^+$ ($m_{mu}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV\n\n    *   We can use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n```python\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu)\n# KE_nu = ((m_pi_c2)^2 - (m_mu_c2)^2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\nke_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Calculate the Q-value of the reaction\nq_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (mu+)\n# KE_mu = Q-value - KE_nu\nke_mu = q_value - ke_nu\n\n# The question asks for the KE of the product particles, which are the muon and the neutrino.\n# The options list pairs of values. We check which pair matches our calculated values.\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nThe output of the code is:\n```\nKE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n```\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the solution based on the calculations:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: The initial energy is the rest mass energy of the stationary pion ($E_{\\pi^+} = m_{\\pi}c^2$). This energy is converted into the total energies of the muon ($E_{\\mu^+}$) and the neutrino ($E_{\\nu}$).\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. The muon and neutrino must be emitted in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude ($p$).\n    $\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0 \\implies |\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy**: The total energy of a particle is $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}$.\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu^+} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the neutrino (assumed massless): $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0} = pc$. The kinetic energy of the neutrino is its total energy, so $KE_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\n4.  **Calculation**: Substituting these into the energy conservation equation:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n    As derived in the reasoning step and calculated by the Python code:\n    $KE_{\\nu} = pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2m_{\\pi}c^2}$\n    $KE_{\\mu^+} = E_{total\\_released} - KE_{\\nu} = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2) - KE_{\\nu}$\n\n5.  **Results**: The Python code executed these calculations with the given values:\n    *   $m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n    *   $m_{\\mu}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV\n\n    The output was:\n    *   KE of neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$): 29.78 MeV (approximately 29.8 MeV)\n    *   KE of muon ($KE_{\\mu^+}$): 4.12 MeV\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: The calculated kinetic energies for the muon and the neutrino are 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
