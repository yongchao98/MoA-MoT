    "This problem requires us to determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### 1. Single-Particle States and Energies\n\nFor a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L, the energy levels are quantized and given by:\n$E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere *n* is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nSo, the energy of the *n*-th level is simply $E_n = n^2 E$.\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 fermions. This means they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number *n* and the spin projection quantum number *m_s* (+1/2 for spin-up, -1/2 for spin-down).\n\nTherefore, for each energy level *n*, there are two available quantum states: (n, spin-up) and (n, spin-down). This means each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles.\n\n### 2. System Energy States\n\nThe total energy of the four-particle system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles. To find the energies of the ground state and excited states, we need to distribute the four particles into the single-particle states in a way that minimizes the total energy.\n\n#### Ground State (E_ground)\n\nTo achieve the lowest possible total energy (the ground state), we fill the energy levels from the bottom up.\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy = 1²E = E):** We can place two particles here, one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy = 2²E = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles in this level, one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\nThe configuration for the ground state is two particles in n=1 and two particles in n=2.\nThe total energy is the sum of the energies of these four particles:\n$E_{ground} = (E_1 + E_1) + (E_2 + E_2)$\n$E_{ground} = (1E + 1E) + (4E + 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n#### First Excited State (E_first)\n\nTo get the first excited state, we need to find the lowest-energy excitation from the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   **Ground state configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2.\n*   **Highest occupied level:** n=2.\n*   **Lowest unoccupied level:** n=3.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n\nThe new configuration is:\n*   Two particles in n=1 (Energy = E each)\n*   One particle in n=2 (Energy = 4E)\n*   One particle in n=3 (Energy = 3²E = 9E)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{first} = (E_1 + E_1) + E_2 + E_3$\n$E_{first} = (1E + 1E) + 4E + 9E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n#### Second Excited State (E_second)\n\nTo find the second excited state, we must find the configuration with the next lowest total energy. Let's consider the possible excitations from the ground state that would have slightly more energy than the first excited state.\n\n*   **Ground State Config:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2. (Energy = 10E)\n*   **First Excited State Config:** 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. (Energy = 15E)\n\nLet's analyze other possible configurations:\n1.  **Move a particle from n=1 to n=3:** This results in one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $1 \\times E_1 + 2 \\times E_2 + 1 \\times E_3 = 1 \\times (1E) + 2 \\times (4E) + 1 \\times (9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n2.  **Move two particles from n=2 to n=3:** This results in two particles in n=1 and two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $2 \\times E_1 + 2 \\times E_3 = 2 \\times (1E) + 2 \\times (9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n3.  **Move one particle from n=2 to n=4:** This results in two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = $2 \\times E_1 + 1 \\times E_2 + 1 \\times E_4 = 2 \\times (1E) + 1 \\times (4E) + 1 \\times (16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the third lowest energy for the system is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n### Summary\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\nTo verify this, we can run a short script to enumerate the possible states and their energies.\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef calculate_energies():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the energies of the lowest states for four spin-1/2 particles\n    in a 1D infinite potential well.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Generate single-particle states (n, spin) and their energies (n^2).\n    # Considering n up to 6 should be sufficient for the lowest states.\n    single_particle_states = []\n    for n in range(1, 7):\n        # Each energy level n can have two particles (spin up/down)\n        single_particle_states.append({'level': n, 'energy': n**2})\n        single_particle_states.append({'level': n, 'energy': n**2})\n\n    # To model the Pauli exclusion principle, we treat the two states at the same\n    # energy level n as distinct.

    "This problem asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### 1. Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFor a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the energy levels are quantized. The energy of the *n*-th level is given by:\n$E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere *n* is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Therefore, the energy of the *n*-th level can be expressed as:\n$E_n = n^2 E$\n\nSo, the first few single-particle energy levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n### 2. Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For this system, a quantum state is defined by the pair of quantum numbers: the principal quantum number *n* and the spin projection quantum number *m_s* (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n\nThis implies that each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### 3. Calculating the System Energies\n\nThe total energy of the four-particle system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles. We need to find the three lowest possible total energies by distributing the four particles among the available single-particle states.\n\n#### Ground State (Lowest Energy)\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up:\n*   We place the first two particles in the lowest energy level, **n=1** (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1E) = 2E$.\n*   We place the next two particles in the second lowest energy level, **n=2** (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (4E) = 8E$.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n#### First Excited State (Next Lowest Energy)\n\nTo find the first excited state, we create the lowest-energy excitation from the ground state. This is done by moving one particle from the highest occupied level to the lowest unoccupied level.\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{first} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{first} = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n#### Second Excited State (Third Lowest Energy)\n\nTo find the second excited state, we need to find the configuration with the next lowest energy. We can consider other possible excitations from the ground state:\n*   **Possibility 1 (First Excited State):** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3. Energy = 15E.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Move one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration becomes: one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n*   **Possibility 3:** Move one particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration becomes: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=4.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states we have found so far (15E, 18E, 22E, ...), the lowest energy is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states of the system are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
