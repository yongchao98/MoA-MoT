    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **A:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. This is a norbornadiene derivative, which will act as a dienophile. It has two double bonds, so it can react twice.\n    *   **B:** 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium iodide (NaI).\n*   **Reaction:** The first step is the in-situ generation of a reactive diene from reactant B. The reaction of gem-dihalides, such as the two -CHBr2 groups in B, with sodium iodide is a known method for reductive elimination to form double bonds. In this case, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene undergoes a double elimination reaction to form 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. Let's call this reactive diene **I**.\n\n    *   Structure of Diene **I** (5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene): It is a six-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions C1-C2 and C3-C4, and two exocyclic double bonds (=CH2) at positions C5 and C6. The molecular formula is C8H8.\n\n*   **Diels-Alder Reaction:** The generated diene **I** is highly reactive and undergoes a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition with the dienophile **A**.\n    *   The problem states that 2 equivalents of reactant B are used for every 1 equivalent of reactant A. This means 2 equivalents of diene **I** are generated.\n    *   Since dienophile **A** has two double bonds, it undergoes two successive Diels-Alder reactions, one with each molecule of diene **I**.\n    *   **Product 1** is the resulting double adduct. It is a large, complex polycyclic molecule with a C2 axis of symmetry, assuming the additions occur from the same face (*exo* or *endo*). The central part of the molecule is the original bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton, with the -O-tBu group at the C7 bridge.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Transformation:** Strong acid is used to cleave the tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-O-tBu) at C7 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a standard deprotection step.\n*   **Product 2** is the same as Product 1, but with a C7-OH group instead of a C7-O-tBu group. The overall symmetry of the molecule is maintained.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with SO3-pyridine complex in DMSO.\n*   **Transformation:** This set of reagents is used for the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method to oxidize alcohols. The secondary alcohol at C7 in Product 2 is oxidized to a ketone.\n*   **Product 3** is the corresponding ketone, with a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C7 position. The core of the molecule is now a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadien-7-one derivative.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150 °C.\n*   **Transformation:** The core of Product 3, the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadien-7-one system, is known to be thermally unstable. Heating triggers a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. In fact, it triggers a double retro-Diels-Alder reaction, reversing the cycloadditions from Step 1.\n    *   Product 3 → 2 × Diene **I** + Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one\n*   The extruded dienophile, bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one, is itself unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one → Benzene + CO\n*   The question asks for the \"final product 4\", which refers to the major organic product of interest from this reaction sequence. This is the diene **I** that was regenerated.\n*   Therefore, **Product 4 is 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4, which is 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene (C8H8).\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule consists of a six-membered ring (C1-C6) and two exocyclic methylene (=CH2) groups. The bonds are C1=C2-C3=C4-C5-C6-C1, with C5=CH2 and C6=CH2. Due to the conjugated pi system, the molecule is expected to be planar or nearly planar. It possesses a C2 axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n\n*   **Identifying Equivalent Hydrogens:** This C2 symmetry makes pairs of atoms chemically equivalent.\n    *   The hydrogen on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. Let's call this **Set A**.\n    *   The hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. Let's call this **Set B**.\n    *   Now consider the methylidene (=CH2) groups. On each group, the two hydrogens are in different chemical environments relative to the ring; they are diastereotopic. Let's call them H_inner (closer to the C2=C3 part of the ring) and H_outer.\n    *   The C2 axis of symmetry exchanges the entire methylidene group at C5 with the one at C6.\n    *   Therefore, the H_inner on the C5-methylidene is equivalent to the H_inner on the C6-methylidene. This forms **Set C**.\n    *   Similarly, the H_outer on the C5-methylidene is equivalent to the H_outer on the C6-methylidene. This forms **Set D**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** We have identified four distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n    1.  {H on C1, H on C4}\n    2.  {H on C2, H on C3}\n    3.  {H_inner on C5=CH2, H_inner on C6=CH2}\n    4.  {H_outer on C5=CH2, H_outer on C6=CH2}\n\nEach set contains two chemically equivalent hydrogen atoms. Therefore, there are a total of **4** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4. This would correspond to 4 signals in a proton NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
