    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Part A)**\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom—a hydrogen atom on an sp3-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n    1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone, C₆H₄O₂):**\n        *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl groups at opposite positions.\n        *   The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds within the ring.\n        *   These alpha-carbons are sp2-hybridized, not sp3-hybridized.\n        *   Since there are no alpha-hydrogens on sp3-hybridized carbons, benzoquinone cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (C₆H₆O₃):**\n        *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons between the carbonyls (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups.\n        *   These carbons (C2, C4, C6) are sp3-hybridized and are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons has two alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   Due to the presence of these alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can and does exhibit keto-enol tautomerism. It readily converts to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and highly stable compound.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism. Therefore, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Part B)**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Methyl lactate):**\n        *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        *   This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since the carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and thus exhibits optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n    2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is the *trans* isomer, meaning the two methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃) groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n        *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there are no chiral centers.\n        *   The molecule possesses a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the C=C bond), which makes it achiral.\n        *   Since the molecule is achiral, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism. Therefore, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer:**\n    *   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
