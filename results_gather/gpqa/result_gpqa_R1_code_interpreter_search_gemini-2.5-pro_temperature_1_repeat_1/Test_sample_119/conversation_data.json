    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Premise:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This is a crucial assumption, which means the number density of stars, let's call it `n` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere in space.\n\n2.  **Relating Parallax to Distance:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The relationship is given by:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n    This means that a larger parallax corresponds to a smaller distance, and a smaller parallax corresponds to a larger distance.\n\n3.  **Considering a Volume of Space:** Let's think about the number of stars up to a certain distance `d`. These stars are contained within a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer. The volume `V` of this sphere is:\n    `V = (4/3) * π * d³`\n\n4.  **Counting Stars in a Shell:** The question asks for the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*. This is a density function. To find it, let's consider the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell, `dV`, can be approximated as the surface area of the sphere times its thickness:\n        `dV = (Surface Area) * (thickness) = (4πd²) * dd`\n    *   Since the star density `n` is constant, the number of stars `dN` in this shell is:\n        `dN = n * dV = n * 4πd² * dd`\n\n5.  **Expressing in Terms of Parallax:** Now, we need to convert this expression from being in terms of `d` and `dd` to being in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between the thickness of the shell `dd` and the corresponding small range in parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the distance-parallax relation:\n        `d(d) / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`. The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are counting stars, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n6.  **Substituting into the Star Count Equation:** Now substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = n * 4π * (1/plx)² * [ (1/plx²) * d(plx) ]`\n\n7.  **Simplifying the Expression:** Combine the terms involving `plx`:\n    `dN = n * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `dN / d(plx) = 4πn / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:** The term `dN / d(plx)` represents the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Since `4`, `π`, and the stellar density `n` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `Number of stars per unit parallax range ∝ 1 / plx⁴`\n\nThis means the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<A>>>"
