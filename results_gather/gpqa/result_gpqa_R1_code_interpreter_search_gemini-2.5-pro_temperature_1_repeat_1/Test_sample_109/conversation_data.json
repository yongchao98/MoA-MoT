    "`Paranal Observatory` is located in the southern hemisphere (latitude ~24° S), so it can observe stars in the southern celestial hemisphere and part of the northern one. `Keck Observatory` is in the northern hemisphere (latitude ~20° N) and can observe stars in the northern celestial hemisphere and part of the southern one. For a star to be observable from both observatories, its declination must be in a range visible from both locations.\n\n*   An observer at latitude `L` can theoretically observe stars with declination `δ` between `L - 90°` and `L + 90°`. However, for practical ground-based observations, the star must rise above the horizon.\n*   For Keck (latitude ≈ +20° N), the observable declination range is from `20 - 90 = -70°` to `+90°`.\n*   For Paranal (latitude ≈ -24° S), the observable declination range is from `-90°` to `-24 + 90 = +66°`.\n*   Therefore, to be visible from **both** observatories, a star must have a declination `δ` such that **-70° < δ < +66°**.\n\nThe second condition is the apparent brightness.\n*   ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 17 (m_V < 17).\n*   HIRES can observe stars with m_V brighter than 16 (m_V < 16).\n*   To be detectable by **both**, a star must have an apparent V magnitude **m_V < 16**.\n\nLet's evaluate each star based on these two criteria: Declination and Apparent Magnitude.\n\nThe relationship between apparent magnitude (m_V), absolute magnitude (M_V), distance in parsecs (d), and extinction (A_V) is:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\nThe extinction in the V band is given by `A_V = R_V * E(B-V)`, where `R_V = 3.1`.\n\n**Star 1:**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the observable range for Keck Observatory (-70° to +90°).\n*   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star 2:**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = 55°. This is within the observable range for both observatories (-70° < 55° < +66°).\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** m_V = 16.5 mag. This is not brighter than 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star 3:**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = 48°. This is within the observable range for both observatories (-70° < 48° < +66°).\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** m_V = 15.5 mag. This is brighter than 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\n**Star 4:**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = -48°. This is within the observable range for both observatories (-70° < -48° < +66°).\n*   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   M_V = 15.5 mag\n    *   d = 10 pc\n    *   E(B-V) = 0.4 mag\n    *   A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 * 1 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n    *   This is not brighter than 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star 5:**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = 60°. This is within the observable range for both observatories (-70° < 60° < +66°).\n*   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   M_V = 16.5 mag\n    *   d = 5 pc\n    *   A_V = 0 (no extinction mentioned)\n    *   m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 + 0 ≈ 16.5 + 5 * 0.699 - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995 mag.\n    *   m_V ≈ 15.0 mag. This is brighter than 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\nOnly Star3 and Star5 meet both the declination and apparent magnitude criteria for observation by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n<<<A>>>"
