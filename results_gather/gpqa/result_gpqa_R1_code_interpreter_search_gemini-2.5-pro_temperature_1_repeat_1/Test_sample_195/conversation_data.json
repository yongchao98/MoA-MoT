    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the relevant physical principles:**\nThe problem involves a relativistic object moving under the influence of a conservative force (from a spring, obeying Hooke's Law). The key principle to use is the conservation of energy. In special relativity, the total energy of a particle must be considered.\n\n**2. Define the energy components:**\n*   **Relativistic Kinetic Energy (K):** For a particle of rest mass `m` moving at speed `v`, the kinetic energy is given by `K = (γ - 1)mc²`, where `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ` is the Lorentz factor and `c` is the speed of light.\n*   **Potential Energy (U):** The force is given by Hooke's Law, `F = -kx`. The potential energy `U(x)` is the negative integral of the force with respect to position:\n    `U(x) = -∫ F dx = -∫ (-kx) dx = (1/2)kx²`. We set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position (`x=0`).\n\n**3. Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy:**\nIn a conservative system, the total mechanical energy `E_mech` is conserved. The total mechanical energy is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy.\n`E_mech = K + U = (γ - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx² = constant`\n\n**4. Analyze the system at two key points:**\nWe need to evaluate the total energy at two specific points in the oscillator's motion:\n*   **Point 1: At maximum amplitude (x = A):**\n    At the point of maximum displacement, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction. Therefore, its speed is zero (`v = 0`).\n    When `v = 0`, the Lorentz factor `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0²/c²) = 1`.\n    The kinetic energy `K = (1 - 1)mc² = 0`.\n    The potential energy is at its maximum: `U(A) = (1/2)kA²`.\n    The total energy at this point is `E_mech = 0 + (1/2)kA² = (1/2)kA²`.\n\n*   **Point 2: At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n    As the mass passes through the equilibrium position, its potential energy is zero, and its speed is at its maximum (`v = v_max`).\n    The kinetic energy is `K = (γ_max - 1)mc²`, where `γ_max = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)`.\n    The potential energy is `U(0) = (1/2)k(0)² = 0`.\n    The total energy at this point is `E_mech = (γ_max - 1)mc² + 0 = (γ_max - 1)mc²`.\n\n**5. Equate the energies and solve for v_max:**\nSince energy is conserved, the total energy at Point 1 must equal the total energy at Point 2.\n`(γ_max - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA²`\n\nNow, we solve this equation for `v_max`. First, isolate `γ_max`:\n`γ_max - 1 = (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n`γ_max = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n\nNext, substitute the definition of `γ_max`:\n`1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for `v_max`. Let's invert both sides:\n`sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))`\n\nSquare both sides:\n`1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²`\n\nIsolate the `v_max²/c²` term:\n`v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²`\n\nFinally, multiply by `c²` and take the square root to find `v_max`:\n`v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²)`\n\n**6. Compare with the given options:**\nThe derived expression for `v_max` is:\n`v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}`\n\nThis matches option D exactly.\n\n**Alternative approach using total relativistic energy:**\nOne can also define the total conserved energy as `E_total = γmc² + U(x)`.\n*   At `x=A`, `v=0`, `γ=1`: `E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA²`.\n*   At `x=0`, `v=v_max`, `U=0`: `E_total = γ_max mc²`.\nEquating these gives `γ_max mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA²`, which simplifies to `(γ_max - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA²`, the same equation as before, yielding the same result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
