    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, so its chemical formula is CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. This is equivalent to 0.1428.\n*   The mass fraction can be expressed as: `(mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. For simplicity, we can use atomic masses of H=1 and C=12.\n*   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`\n*   The fraction 1/7 is approximately 0.142857, which is a very close match. So, let's assume `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n*   `7y = 12x + y`\n*   `6y = 12x`\n*   `y = 2x`\n*   This means the empirical formula of Z is (CH2)n, and the molecular formula is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed from hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   A saturated hydrocarbon with the general formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common and stable cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   Let's check the hydrogen mass fraction for cyclohexane: H% = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 â‰ˆ 14.28%. This confirms that Z is very likely cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   It does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic. Benzene, despite being unsaturated, does not react with bromine water under normal conditions due to its aromatic stability.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Let the two components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We have Y1 = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   When mixture Y is hydrogenated, Y1 (cyclohexane) does not react. Y2 must hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\n*   Since Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, it could be another saturated C6 isomer or an aromatic compound. If it were a saturated isomer like methylcyclopentane, severe hydrogenation would cause ring-opening to form alkanes (like n-hexane or methylpentane), not just cyclohexane. This contradicts the condition that *only* Z is formed.\n*   The most plausible candidate for Y2 is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane: `C6H6 + 3H2 --(Pt)--> C6H12`.\n*   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X and Solve the Problem**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n*   When heated with platinum, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. A disproportionation in this context involves hydrogen transfer, where one component is oxidized (loses hydrogen) and the other is reduced (gains hydrogen).\n*   The reaction is: `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6`. Since the products are equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1 on both sides.\n*   From the law of conservation of mass, we can balance the atoms.\n    *   Carbon: C atoms in (X1 + X2) = C atoms in (C6H12 + C6H6) = 6 + 6 = 12.\n    *   Hydrogen: H atoms in (X1 + X2) = H atoms in (C6H12 + C6H6) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both X1 and X2 must have a six-carbon ring structure. So, their formulas are C6Hx and C6Hy.\n*   We know `x + y = 18`.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n*   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X.\n*   Let's consider possible non-conjugated, unsaturated C6-ring compounds:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: One double bond. Non-conjugated.\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Two double bonds, which are not conjugated.\n    *   (1,3-Cyclohexadiene has conjugated bonds, so it is ruled out).\n*   Let's test if these two compounds fit our hydrogen count:\n    *   If X1 = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n*   The disproportionation reaction would be:\n    `C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) --> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)`\n    In this reaction, the diene is oxidized to benzene by losing 2H, and the cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane by gaining 2H. This is a plausible catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\nTotal H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<C>>>"
