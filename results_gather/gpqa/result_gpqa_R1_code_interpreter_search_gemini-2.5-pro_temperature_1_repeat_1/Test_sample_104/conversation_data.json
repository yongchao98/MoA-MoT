    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Problem**\n\nThe problem asks us to compare two different phenomena that cause a star's brightness to dim periodically:\n*   **Rotational Modulation:** A star with cool, dark spots on its surface will appear dimmer when the spotted region rotates into view, and brighter when the unspotted region is visible.\n*   **Exoplanet Transit:** A planet passing in front of its star blocks a small fraction of the starlight, causing a temporary dip in brightness.\n\nWe need to find the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would block the same amount of light as the starspots do.\n\n**2. Quantify the Brightness Drop due to Starspots**\n\nThe brightness (or more formally, the flux, F) of a star is related to its temperature (T) by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to T⁴.\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere, with a uniform temperature `T_eff = 6000 K`, is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to `T_eff⁴`. We can write this as `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`.\n\n*   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. This hemisphere is not entirely covered in spots. It has a spot \"filling factor\" `f_spot = 20% = 0.20`. This means 20% of the visible surface has the cooler spot temperature `T_spot`, and the remaining 80% (`1 - f_spot`) has the normal star temperature `T_eff`.\n    *   The temperature of the spots is `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   The total flux is a weighted average of the flux from the hot and cool areas: `F_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Amplitude of the Starspot Signal**\n\nThe \"amplitude\" of the signal is the relative change in brightness between the maximum and minimum states.\n\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\nAmplitude = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n\nSubstituting the expressions for flux:\nAmplitude = 1 - [ ( (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴ ) / T_eff⁴ ]\nAmplitude = 1 - [ (1 - f_spot) + f_spot * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴ ]\nAmplitude = 1 - 1 + f_spot - f_spot * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\nAmplitude = f_spot * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴ ]\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values to calculate the amplitude.\n\n**4. Quantify the Brightness Drop due to an Exoplanet**\n\nWhen a planet transits a star, it blocks an amount of light equal to the ratio of its projected area (`A_pl = π * R_pl²`) to the star's projected area (`A_star = π * R_star²`). This is called the transit depth (δ).\n\nTransit Depth (δ) = A_pl / A_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**5. Equate the Two Signals and Solve**\n\nThe problem states that the amplitude of the signal from the exoplanet should be the same as the amplitude from the starspots.\n\nTransit Depth = Amplitude\n(R_pl / R_star)² = f_spot * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴ ]\n\nTo find the relative radius of the planet (`R_pl / R_star`), we just need to take the square root of both sides.\n\n`R_pl / R_star` = √ ( f_spot * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴ ] )\n\nThis calculation can be performed efficiently using a short Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the star's properties\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000.0 # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin (6000K - 1000K)\nf_spot = 0.20   # Filling factor of spots on the spotted hemisphere\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to rotational modulation.\n# This is the relative flux drop when the spotted hemisphere is in view.\n# Amplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\namplitude_from_spots = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The amplitude of a transit signal (transit depth) is given by (R_pl / R_star)^2.\n# We set the two amplitudes to be equal.\n# (R_pl / R_star)^2 = amplitude_from_spots\n\n# Solve for the relative radius of the planet (R_pl / R_star).\nrelative_planet_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude_from_spots)\n\nprint(relative_planet_radius)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3217924849999547\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.3218. This value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Problem**\n\nThe problem requires us to find the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same periodic dimming of a star's light as a large, cool starspot region does. This means we need to calculate the brightness drop caused by the starspots and equate it to the brightness drop caused by a transiting planet.\n\n**2. Calculate the Brightness Drop from Starspots**\n\nThe brightness (or more accurately, the flux, F) emitted by a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that `F = σT⁴`, where `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and `T` is the temperature. The total flux is proportional to `T⁴`.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted, hotter hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible surface has a temperature `T_eff = 6000 K`. So, `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`.\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. This hemisphere is a mix of two temperatures:\n    *   The normal stellar surface temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n    *   The cooler spot temperature, `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   The spots cover 20% of this hemisphere (filling factor `f_spot = 0.20`). This means 80% (`1 - f_spot`) of the surface is at `T_eff` and 20% (`f_spot`) is at `T_spot`.\n    *   The total flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average: `F_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴`.\n\n*   **Amplitude of the Signal:** The amplitude of the variation is the relative change in flux between the maximum and minimum states.\n\n    Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n    Amplitude = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n\n    Substituting the expressions for flux:\n\n    Amplitude = 1 - [((1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴]\n    Amplitude = 1 - [(1 - f_spot) + f_spot * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n    Amplitude = 1 - 1 + f_spot - f_spot * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\n    Amplitude = f_spot * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\n**3. Calculate the Brightness Drop from an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nWhen a planet passes in front of its star, it blocks a circular area of light. The drop in brightness, called the transit depth (δ), is the ratio of the planet's area (`A_pl = π * R_pl²`) to the star's area (`A_star = π * R_star²`).\n\n    Transit Depth (δ) = A_pl / A_star\n    δ = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\n    δ = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**4. Equate the Signals and Solve**\n\nThe problem asks for the planet radius that produces the *same amplitude signal*. Therefore, we set the transit depth equal to the starspot amplitude.\n\n    (R_pl / R_star)² = f_spot * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\nNow, we can solve for the relative radius `R_pl / R_star` by taking the square root of both sides.\n\n    R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f_spot * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴] )\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n*   `f_spot = 0.20`\n*   `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   `T_spot = 5000 K`\n\n    R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴] )\n    R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴] )\n    R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * [1 - 0.48225] )\n    R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * 0.51775 )\n    R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.10355 )\n    R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.32179\n\nThe calculated relative radius is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
