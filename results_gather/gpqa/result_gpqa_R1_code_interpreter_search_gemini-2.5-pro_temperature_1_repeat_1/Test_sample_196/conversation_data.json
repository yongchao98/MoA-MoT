  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of Compound X from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong, sharp peak is characteristic of the C=O stretching vibration of a carbonyl group, specifically from a carboxylic acid (often around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n        *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks are in the region for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** The data strongly suggests that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet this far downfield is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is shifted downfield, indicating these protons are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The doublet at 7.2 ppm is further upfield, indicating these protons are adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis (2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, 0.9 ppm):** Let's piece together the other substituent on the ring.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a terminal ethyl fragment (-CH₂-CH₃).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from the ethyl fragment. It's a multiplet because it's split by both the adjacent -CH₃ (triplet) and the adjacent -CH- (doublet).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). This proton is attached directly to the aromatic ring (causing a downfield shift) and is split by the protons on both adjacent carbons (-CH₃ and -CH₂-), resulting in a complex multiplet.\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The fragments are -CH₂CH₃ and -CH(CH₃)-. Putting them together on the methine carbon gives a **sec-butyl** group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\n\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydriodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to their corresponding methyl groups (-CH₃). It will also reduce ketones and aldehydes to alkanes but does not typically affect aromatic rings or simple alkyl groups.\n    *   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring will remain unchanged.\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Product: The -COOH at position 4 is converted to a -CH₃. The sec-butyl group at position 1 remains. The product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n    *   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the predicted product.\n    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has an isobutyl group [-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂], not a sec-butyl group.\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
