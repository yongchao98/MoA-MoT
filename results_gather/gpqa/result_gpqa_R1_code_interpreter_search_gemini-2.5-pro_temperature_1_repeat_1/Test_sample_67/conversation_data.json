    "Here is a step-by-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle, meaning its spin angular momentum `S` has a z-component `Sz` with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` (spin up) and `-ħ/2` (spin down).\n*   Its magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component of the magnetic moment is `μz = γSz`.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_initial = B * ẑ` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian (energy operator) of the particle in this field is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(S ⋅ B_initial) = -γB * Sz`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n    *   The energy for spin up (`|+z>`) is `E_up = -γB * (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`.\n    *   The energy for spin down (`|-z>`) is `E_down = -γB * (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`.\n*   The lowest energy state is the spin-up state, `|+z>`. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. The Change in the System\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field along the Z-axis is turned off, and a new magnetic field `B_final = B * ŷ` (pointing in the +Y direction) is turned on.\n*   For all `t > 0`, the system evolves according to the new Hamiltonian: `H' = -μ ⋅ B_final = -γ(S ⋅ B_final) = -γB * Sy`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the System\n\nThe problem asks for the oscillation of the *average* (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μz(t)>`. This can be found in two ways.\n\n#### Method 1: Larmor Precession (Classical Analogy)\n\nThis is the most direct method. The time evolution of the expectation value of the spin vector, `<S>`, in a magnetic field `B` is governed by the equation:\n`d<S>/dt = γ * <S> x B`\n\nThis equation describes the precession of the vector `<S>` around the magnetic field vector `B` with an angular frequency known as the **Larmor frequency**, `ω_L`.\n\n*   **Larmor Frequency:** `ω_L = γ * |B|`\n*   In our case, the new field has magnitude `B`, so the precession frequency is `ω_L = γB`.\n*   **Initial Spin Vector:** At `t=0`, the state is `|+z>`. The expectation value of the spin vector is `<S(0)> = <+z|S|+z>`.\n    *   `<Sx(0)> = <+z|Sx|+z> = 0`\n    *   `<Sy(0)> = <+z|Sy|+z> = 0`\n    *   `<Sz(0)> = <+z|Sz|+z> = ħ/2`\n    *   So, initially, `<S(0)> = (ħ/2) * ẑ`. The spin vector points along the Z-axis.\n*   **Precession:** For `t>0`, the spin vector `<S(t)>` precesses around the new magnetic field `B_final = B * ŷ`. This means `<S(t)>` rotates in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis.\n*   **Z-Component Oscillation:** As the vector `<S(t)>` rotates in the X-Z plane, its projection onto the Z-axis, `<Sz(t)>`, will oscillate. The frequency of this rotation is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n*   Therefore, `<Sz(t)>` oscillates as `<Sz(t)> = <Sz(0)> * cos(ω_L * t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γB * t)`.\n*   The z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μz(t)> = γ * <Sz(t)> = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γB * t)`.\n*   The angular frequency of this oscillation is `γB`.\n\n#### Method 2: Full Quantum Mechanical Calculation\n\n1.  **Express Initial State in New Basis:** The new Hamiltonian `H'` is proportional to `Sy`. We need to express the initial state `|+z>` in the eigenbasis of `Sy`. The eigenstates of `Sy` are:\n    *   `|+y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> + i|-z>)`\n    *   `|-y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> - i|-z>)`\n    Inverting these gives:\n    *   `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    So, `|ψ(t=0)> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n\n2.  **Apply Time Evolution:** The state at a later time `t` is `|ψ(t)> = e^(-iH't/ħ)|ψ(0)>`. Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are eigenstates of `H'`, this is straightforward.\n    *   The energy eigenvalues for `H' = -γB*Sy` are `E'_+ = -γB(ħ/2)` for `|+y>` and `E'_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)` for `|-y>`.\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(-iE'_+t/ħ)|+y> + e^(-iE'_-t/ħ)|-y> ]`\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(iγBt/2)|+y> + e^(-iγBt/2)|-y> ]`\n\n3.  **Calculate Expectation Value `<Sz(t)>`:**\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `|+y>` and `|-y>` back into `|ψ(t)>`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>` (After simplification, as shown in the thought process).\n    *   Now calculate `<Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`:\n        `<Sz(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * Sz * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n    *   Using `Sz|±z> = ±(ħ/2)|±z>` and the orthogonality of the states:\n        `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n    *   Using the double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n        `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n4.  **Find Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the spin is `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μz(t)> = γ<Sz(t)> = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The term oscillates with the form `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω` is `γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods show that the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with an angular frequency of `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
