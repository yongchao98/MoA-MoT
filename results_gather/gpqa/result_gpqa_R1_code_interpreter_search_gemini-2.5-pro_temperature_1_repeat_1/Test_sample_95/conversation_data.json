    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to calculate the order of magnitude of the entropy (S) of a supermassive black hole given its distance (d) from Earth and the angular size (θ) of its event horizon.\n\n### **2. Identify Given Information**\n\n*   Distance to the black hole, $d = 10^{10}$ parsecs.\n*   Angular size of the event horizon, $\\theta = 10^{-17}$ degrees.\n\n### **3. Recall Necessary Physical Principles and Formulas**\n\n1.  **Small Angle Approximation:** To find the physical size (diameter, D) of an object from its angular size (θ) and distance (d), we use the formula $D = d \\times \\theta$. For this formula to be valid, the angle θ must be in radians.\n2.  **Schwarzschild Radius:** The radius of a non-rotating black hole's event horizon is the Schwarzschild radius, $R_{sh}$. The diameter we calculate will be $D = 2 \\times R_{sh}$.\n3.  **Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy:** The entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon (A). The formula is:\n    $S = \\frac{k_B c^3 A}{4 \\hbar G}$\n    where:\n    *   $A = 4\\pi R_{sh}^2$ (Area of a sphere).\n    *   $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant ($1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}$).\n    *   $c$ is the speed of light ($3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$).\n    *   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s}$).\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant ($6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ N m}^2/\\text{kg}^2$).\n\n### **4. Formulate a Step-by-Step Plan**\n\n1.  Convert all given units to standard SI units (meters for distance, radians for angle).\n2.  Calculate the physical diameter (D) of the event horizon using the small angle approximation.\n3.  Determine the Schwarzschild radius ($R_{sh}$) from the diameter.\n4.  Calculate the area (A) of the event horizon using the radius.\n5.  Substitute the area into the Bekenstein-Hawking formula to find the entropy (S).\n6.  Identify the order of magnitude of the final result.\n\n### **5.
