    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge q. These are famously known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework: Retarded Potentials\n\nThe electromagnetic field does not respond instantaneously to the motion of a charge. Instead, it propagates outward at the speed of light, c. Therefore, the potential at a specific observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time t is determined not by the charge's current position and velocity, but by its position and velocity at an earlier time, $t_r$, called the **retarded time**.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is defined such that the time delay $t - t_r$ is exactly the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$, denoted as $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n\nLet $\\vec{d}$ be the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point:\n$\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$\nLet d be the magnitude of this vector:\n$d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$\n\nThe retarded time condition is then:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Potentials\n\nThe general expressions for the potentials in terms of charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ are the retarded potential formulas:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|} dV'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|} dV'$\nwhere $t_r = t - |\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|/c$.\n\nFor a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$ with velocity $\\vec{v}(t) = d\\vec{s}/dt$, the charge and current densities are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q\\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral formulas and performing the integration (a non-trivial step that accounts for the fact that $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r'}$), we arrive at the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nA key part of the derivation involves a correction factor that arises from a relativistic Doppler-like effect. As the charge moves, the \"length\" of the signal it emits is compressed or stretched from the observer's perspective. This modifies the effective charge density. The correction factor is found to be $\\frac{1}{1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$, where $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$.\n\nThe resulting potentials, evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$, are:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n### 3. Matching with the Options\n\nLet's rewrite the denominator using the problem's notation:\n$d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) = d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d c}\\right) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expressions for V and A:\n\nFor the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential A:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese two expressions exactly match option D.\n\nWe can also check the relationship between $\\vec{A}$ and $V$:\n$\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} V$\nSince $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, we have $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$.\nSo, $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. This confirms the consistency of the expressions in option D.\n\n*   Option A and B use the static potential form, which is incorrect for a moving charge where retardation effects are considered.\n*   Option C has the wrong sign in the denominator ($dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$). The correct sign is negative, reflecting that the potential is enhanced when the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$).\n\nTherefore, option D correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>"
