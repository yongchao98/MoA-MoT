    "*   **Analyze the options based on physical principles:** The key concept here is **gravitational compression**. For planets with the same composition (i.e., made of the same materials like iron, silicate rock, etc.), a more massive planet will exert a stronger gravitational pull on itself. This intense gravity compresses the planet's material, squeezing it into a smaller volume than it would otherwise occupy. A higher mass packed into a proportionally smaller volume results in a higher overall density.\n\n*   **Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our reference point. Earth has a known average density of approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's denote this as ρ_Earth.\n\n*   **Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density of this planet is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is virtually the same as Earth's density.\n\n*   **Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** Since this planet has the same composition as Earth but is much more massive (5 times the mass), its self-gravity will be significantly stronger. This will cause much greater gravitational compression, leading to a density significantly higher than Earth's. So, ρ_c > ρ_Earth.\n\n*   **Option d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This planet is less massive than Earth. With weaker self-gravity, there will be less gravitational compression compared to Earth. Therefore, its density will be lower than Earth's. So, ρ_d < ρ_Earth.\n\n*   **Comparison and Conclusion:**\n    *   Density of planet (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density of planet (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density of planet (c) > 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density of planet (d) < 5.51 g/cm³\n\nComparing the four options, the planet in option (c) will be the most compressed due to its large mass, and will therefore have the highest density.\n\n<<<D>>>"
