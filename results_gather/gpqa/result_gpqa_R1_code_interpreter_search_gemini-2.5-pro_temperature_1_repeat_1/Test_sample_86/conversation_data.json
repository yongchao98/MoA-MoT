    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound and its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring with two groups attached (C6H4XY).\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents (X and Y) must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Data:**\n    *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present.\n\n**2. Deduce the Possible Chemical Structure**\n\n*   From the FTIR data, we know one substituent (let's say X) is a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, or -I). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent (Y) must contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible C2 substituents containing a carbonyl group:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This has 2 carbons and a C=O. If this group is attached to the halo-benzene ring, the structure would be **halo-acetophenone** (C6H4(X)(COCH3)). This structure fits all the criteria: 8 carbons (6+2), di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n    *   **Formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO):** This also has 2 carbons and a C=O. The structure would be **halo-phenylacetaldehyde** (C6H4(X)(CH2CHO)). This structure also fits all the criteria.\n    *   Other groups like carboxymethyl (-CH2COOH) or methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH3) would also fit the carbon count and functional group requirement, but we will see that their expected NMR spectra do not match any of the options.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Options**\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to match the predicted 1H NMR spectrum of our candidate structures with the given options. A di-substituted benzene ring will have 4 aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Option A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows no signals in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). It cannot be the correct answer.\n\n*   **Option C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows only one aromatic proton (1H, s), which would suggest a tetra-substituted ring, contradicting the \"di-substituted\" information. It cannot be the correct answer.\n\n*   **Option B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, is highly characteristic of a **para (1,4)-substituted** benzene ring. The chemical shifts, being far downfield (>7.5 ppm), indicate that both substituents are electron-withdrawing.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** `2.3 (3H, s)`. A singlet integrating to 3 protons in this region (~2.1-2.6 ppm) is the classic signal for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (**-COCH3**).\n    *   **Matching Structure:** This spectrum perfectly matches the description of **p-halo-acetophenone**. The acetyl group (-COCH3) and the halogen (-X) are both electron-withdrawing and are in a para arrangement. The total proton count is 4 (aromatic) + 3 (methyl) = 7H, which matches the integration (2H + 2H + 3H = 7H).\n\n*   **Option D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Characteristic Peaks:** The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is unmistakably an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO). The signal at `3.7 (2H, s)` is consistent with a methylene group adjacent to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl (-Ar-**CH2**-CHO).\n    *   **Matching Structure:** This data points towards the **p-halo-phenylacetaldehyde** structure.\n    *   **Inconsistency:** However, there is a major problem. The aromatic signals are at `7.8` and `7.6` ppm. For a phenylacetaldehyde, the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group is insulated from the ring by a CH2 group. Its effect on the ring is minimal. The aromatic protons should therefore appear much closer to the region for a simple halobenzene, around 7.2-7.4 ppm. The downfield shifts of 7.6-7.8 ppm are inconsistent with this structure. Such strong deshielding requires direct conjugation of the ring with an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl, as seen in acetophenone.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\n*   Option B describes the NMR spectrum of p-halo-acetophenone. All features of the spectrum (aromatic pattern, aromatic shifts, aliphatic signal) are consistent with this structure.\n*   Option D contains an internal contradiction: the aliphatic signals point to a phenylacetaldehyde structure, but the aromatic signals are in a region that is chemically incorrect for that structure.\n*   Therefore, the compound is a halo-acetophenone, and the correct 1H NMR data is given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
