    "**1. Deconstruction of the Product from NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's determine the structure of the product formed in the reaction using the provided 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR data. The molecular formula of the starting material, Compound X, is C11H12O. The reaction described is a rearrangement, so the product will also have the formula C11H12O.\n\n*   **13C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   A signal at **δ 197.7** is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, specifically a **ketone**.\n    *   Signals in the aromatic/vinylic region (δ 120-150): δ 126.9 (2C), 127.1, 129.1 (2C), 130.3, 141.5, 144.1. The presence of two signals that each account for two carbons (`126.9 (2C)` and `129.1 (2C)`) strongly suggests a symmetrically substituted benzene ring, most commonly a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   Aliphatic signals: **δ 21.3** and **δ 28.4**. These correspond to sp3 hybridized carbons, likely methyl groups.\n\n*   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   Signals in the aromatic region: **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)**. This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   Other signals in the deshielded region: **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)**. These are two doublets, each for one proton, indicating two adjacent vinylic protons (**-CH=CH-**) that are coupling with each other. Their chemical shifts suggest they are part of a conjugated system.\n    *   Aliphatic signals: **δ 2.28 (3H, s)** and **δ 2.31 (3H, s)**. These are two distinct methyl groups, neither of which is coupled to adjacent protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  We have a **ketone** group (`C=O`).\n    2.  We have a **para-substituted benzene ring**.\n    3.  One of the methyl singlets (e.g., δ 2.31, 3H) and its corresponding 13C signal (δ 21.3) are characteristic of a methyl group attached to an aromatic ring. This gives us a **p-tolyl group** (4-methylphenyl group).\n    4.  The other methyl singlet (δ 2.28, 3H) and its 13C signal (δ 28.4) must belong to the ketone, forming an **acetyl group** (`-CO-CH3`).\n    5.  The remaining pieces are the `-CH=CH-` group.\n    6.  Connecting all fragments (`p-tolyl`, `-CH=CH-`, and `-CO-CH3`) in a chemically stable way leads to the structure of an α,β-unsaturated ketone: **(E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n    Product Structure:\n    `(p-CH3-C6H4)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`\n\n    Let's check if the formula matches C11H12O:\n    (p-tolyl) C7H7 + (-CH=CH-) C2H2 + (-CO-CH3) C2H3O = C11H12O. The formula is correct.\n\n**2. Identification of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe reaction is an isomerization of Compound X into (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. This means Compound X must have the same molecular formula (C11H12O) and contain the same core atoms, including a **p-tolyl group**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound contains a **phenyl group** (`C6H5-`), not a p-tolyl group. Therefore, it cannot be Compound X.\n*   **B) 2-styrylepoxide:** This is `Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`. Its formula is C10H10O, not C11H12O. It also contains a phenyl group. Therefore, it cannot be Compound X.\n*   **C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is `(p-CH3-C6H4)-CH=CH-`. This compound contains the required **p-tolyl group**. Let's check its formula: `(C7H7)-CH=CH-C2H3O` -> C7+1+1+2 = C11; H7+1+1+3 = H12; O1. The formula is **C11H12O**. This is a valid candidate.\n*   **D) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This compound contains a **styryl group** (which has a phenyl ring), not a p-tolyl group. The methyl group is on the oxirane ring. Therefore, it cannot be Compound X.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nBased on the structural analysis of the product derived from the NMR data, only a starting material containing a p-tolyl group could lead to this product via isomerization. Out of the given options, only **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (C)** possesses this structural feature and the correct molecular formula. The reaction is a base-catalyzed rearrangement of an allylic epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated ketone, a known transformation for which the given conditions (DABCO base, heat) are suitable.\n\nTherefore, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<C>>>"
