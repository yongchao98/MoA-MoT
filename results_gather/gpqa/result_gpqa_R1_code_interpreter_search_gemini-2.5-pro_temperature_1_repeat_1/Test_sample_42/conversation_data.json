    "Here is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Parent Compound and Substituents\n\n*   **Parent Compound:** The molecule is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). According to IUPAC rules, this is the principal functional group, and the parent name is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO) is named as a **formyl** group.\n    *   Cyano (-CN) is named as a **cyano** group.\n    *   Hydroxyl (-OH) is named as a **hydroxy** group.\n    *   Dimethyl amino (-N(CH₃)₂) is named as a **(dimethylamino)** group.\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH₃) is named as a **methoxy** group.\n\n### 2. Draw the Structure Based on Positional Information\n\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring, starting with the principal functional group at C1.\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH (This defines the parent benzoic acid).\n\n*   \"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"\n    *   The positions meta to C1 are C3 and C5. For all three groups to be mutually meta, the carbaldehyde and cyano groups must be at C3 and C5.\n\n*   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"\n    *   The position para to C1 is C4. So, the **methoxy group is at C4**.\n\n*   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"\n    *   The positions ortho to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are at C2 and C6.\n\n*   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   This is the key constraint to resolve the ambiguities. The methoxy group is at C4. The nitrile (cyano group) must be ortho to it, meaning the cyano group must be at C3 or C5. The alcohol (hydroxyl group) must also be ortho to the nitrile.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n\n*   **Case 1: Cyano group is at C3.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (ortho), which is consistent.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at C2 (ortho).\n    *   This means the remaining ortho position to C1 (which is C6) must be occupied by the dimethylamino group.\n    *   And the remaining meta position (C5) must be occupied by the formyl group.\n    *   This gives **Structure I**: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂.\n\n*   **Case 2: Cyano group is at C5.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (ortho), which is consistent.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at C6 (ortho).\n    *   This means the remaining ortho position to C1 (which is C2) must be occupied by the dimethylamino group.\n    *   And the remaining meta position (C3) must be occupied by the formyl group.\n    *   This gives **Structure II**: C1-COOH, C2-N(CH₃)₂, C3-CHO, C4-OCH₃, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n\nBoth structures fully satisfy the description. Fortunately, as we will see, IUPAC rules lead to the same name for both. Let's name Structure I.\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nWe need to number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n\n*   **Structure I**: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂\n*   Numbering starts at C1. We can number clockwise (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW).\n*   The set of locants for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for both directions.\n*   **Tie-Breaker Rule:** When the locant sets are identical, we number in the direction that gives the lowest locant to the substituent cited first in alphabetical order.\n*   Let's list the substituents alphabetically: **C**yano, **D**imethylamino, **F**ormyl, **H**ydroxy, **M**ethoxy.\n*   Now, let's write the sequence of locants for this alphabetical list for both numbering directions:\n    *   **CW Numbering (2-OH, 3-CN, 4-OCH₃, 5-CHO, 6-N(CH₃)₂):**\n        *   Cyano is at 3.\n        *   Dimethylamino is at 6.\n        *   Formyl is at 5.\n        *   Hydroxy is at 2.\n        *   Methoxy is at 4.\n        *   The locant sequence is **{3, 6, 5, 2, 4}**.\n    *   **CCW Numbering (2-N(CH₃)₂, 3-CHO, 4-OCH₃, 5-CN, 6-OH):**\n        *   Cyano is at 5.\n        *   Dimethylamino is at 2.\n        *   ...and so on.\n        *   The locant sequence is **{5, 2, 3, 6, 4}**.\n*   We compare the two sequences term by term: {**3**, 6, 5, 2, 4} vs {**5**, 2, 3, 6, 4}. Since 3 is lower than 5, the first sequence is preferred.\n*   Therefore, the **Clockwise (CW) numbering is correct**.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Name\n\nUsing the correct (CW) numbering, the locants are:\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nList these alphabetically to construct the final name:\n3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nThis name matches option A. (If we were to name Structure II, the same procedure would also lead to this exact name, as the counter-clockwise direction would be chosen).\n\n<<<A>>>"
