    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Concepts:** The problem involves unstable particles traveling at relativistic speeds. This immediately brings two key concepts to mind:\n    *   **Special Relativity:** Specifically, time dilation. A moving particle's internal \"clock\" runs slower from the perspective of a stationary observer. The particle's mean lifetime is extended by the Lorentz factor, γ.\n    *   **Radioactive Decay:** The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The number of particles remaining after a certain time decreases exponentially.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equations:**\n    *   Let N₀ be the initial number of particles created at the center.\n    *   Let N(t) be the number of particles that have not decayed after a time `t` in the lab frame (the detector's frame).\n    *   The law of radioactive decay is given by: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_lab)`, where `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particles *in the lab frame*.\n    *   The fraction of particles that survive is `S = N(t) / N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`.\n    *   Time dilation relates the lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) to the particle's proper lifetime (`τ₀`, its lifetime in its own rest frame): `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`.\n    *   The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. So, we can approximate `v ≈ c`.\n    *   The time `t` it takes for a particle to travel the radius `R` of the detector is `t = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n\n3.  **Combine the Equations into a General Formula:**\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `t` and `τ_lab` into the survival fraction equation:\n        `S = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n    *   This can be rearranged as: `S = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ₀))`.\n    *   Notice that `R`, `c`, and `τ₀` are constants for this specific setup and particle type. Let's group them into a single constant `K = R / (c * τ₀)`. This simplifies the equation to:\n        `S = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n4.  **Apply the Formula to the First Scenario:**\n    *   We are given:\n        *   Survival fraction, `S₁ = 1/3`.\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n    *   Plug these values into our simplified formula:\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    *   To solve for the unknown constant `K`, I'll take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n        `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n    *   Now I have a value for the constant `K` that characterizes the system. I don't need to calculate its numerical value yet; I can carry it symbolically.\n\n5.  **Apply the Formula to the Second Scenario:**\n    *   We are given:\n        *   Desired survival fraction, `S₂ = 2/3`.\n    *   We want to find the required Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    *   Plug these values and our expression for `K` into the formula:\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    *   Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n        `-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n        `ln(3/2) = K / γ₂`\n    *   Now, solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Substitute the expression for `K` from step 4 into the equation for `γ₂` from step 5:\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n    *   This is the final symbolic answer. To find the numerical value and match it with the options, I need to compute it. I'll use a Python script for an accurate calculation. The properties of logarithms `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)` can be used to write it as `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Based on the derived formula: gamma2 = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\n# Using the property ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)\ngamma2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / (math.log(3) - math.log(2))\nprint(gamma2)\n```\n\n7.  **Interpret the Result:**\n    *   The code output is `54.18961754019125`.\n    *   This value is extremely close to 54.\n    *   Comparing this result with the given multiple-choice options:\n        A) 54\n        B) 40\n        C) 28\n        D) 68\n    *   The calculated value clearly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem involves two key concepts from physics:\n*   **Radioactive Decay:** Unstable particles decay over time. The fraction of particles, `S`, that survive after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law: `S = N(t) / N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`, where `N₀` is the initial number of particles, `N(t)` is the number at time `t`, and `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particles as measured in the laboratory frame.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A particle's lifetime appears longer when it is moving at a high velocity relative to an observer. This observed lifetime (`τ_lab`) is related to the particle's intrinsic lifetime in its own rest frame (`τ₀`, the proper lifetime) by the Lorentz factor, `γ`: `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`.\n\n**2. Formulate the Governing Equation**\n\nFirst, let's combine these principles.\nThe time `t` it takes for a particle to travel the detector radius `R` at a velocity `v` is `t = R/v`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. So, `t ≈ R/c`.\n\nNow, substitute `t = R/c` and `τ_lab = γ * τ₀` into the survival fraction equation:\n`S = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\nWe can group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ₀` into a single constant, let's call it `K = R / (c * τ₀)`, which is characteristic of the experimental setup and the particle type. The equation simplifies to:\n`S = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n**3. Use the First Scenario to Find the Constant `K`**\n\nWe are given the first scenario:\n*   Survival fraction `S₁ = 1/3`\n*   Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`\n\nPlug these values into our simplified equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\nTo solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n\nSolving for `K`:\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**4. Use the Second Scenario to Find the New Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`)**\n\nNow we have the second scenario:\n*   Desired survival fraction `S₂ = 2/3`\n*   Unknown Lorentz factor `γ₂`\n\nPlug these values and our value for `K` into the equation:\n`2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nAgain, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n\nTo solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(x/y) = -ln(y/x)`:\n`γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, substitute the expression for `K` we found in step 3:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n\nTo get the final numerical answer, we can compute the value of this expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Derived expression for the new Lorentz factor, gamma2\n# gamma2 = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\ngamma2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / math.log(1.5)\n\nprint(gamma2)\n```\nThe output of the code is approximately 54.19.
