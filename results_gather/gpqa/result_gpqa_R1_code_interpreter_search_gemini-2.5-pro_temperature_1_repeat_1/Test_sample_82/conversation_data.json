    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Part 1: Initial Dilution**\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):\n    *   Volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    *   Concentration (M₁) = 0.05 M\n    *   Moles = M₁ × V₁ = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.0010 mol\n\n*   The initial moles of acetic acid are diluted in a new total volume:\n    *   Final Volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n\n*   The new concentration of the diluted acetic acid (M₂) is:\n    *   M₂ = Moles / V₂ = 0.0010 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M CH₃COOH with 0.1 M NaOH.\n\n---\n\n**Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nThe titration reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This means the solution is a buffer containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\npH = pKa + log ( [Conjugate Base] / [Weak Acid] )\n\n*   First, calculate pKa:\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base to weak acid is:\n    *   [Conjugate Base] = 25% of initial acid\n    *   [Weak Acid] = 75% of initial acid remaining\n    *   Ratio = [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] = 25 / 75 = 1/3\n\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) - log(3)\n\nLet's compute the exact value.\n```python\nimport math\n\nKa = 1.85e-5\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\nprint(f\"The pH at 25% titration is: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\n```\n*Code execution result:*\n```\nThe pH at 25% titration is: 4.26\n```\nThe pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n---\n\n**Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), which will hydrolyze water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Step 1: Find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point (V_eq).**\n    *   Moles of NaOH = Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.0010 mol\n    *   V_eq = Moles / Concentration of NaOH = 0.0010 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the total volume and concentration of acetate ([CH₃COO⁻]) at the equivalence point.**\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + V_eq = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n    *   The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acid, which is 0.0010 mol.\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.0010 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.**\n    *   The hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for the acetate ion.\n        *   Kw = Ka × Kb = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ (at 25 °C)\n        *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n    *   Set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\n        *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n        *   Let x = [OH⁻] at equilibrium. Then [CH₃COOH] = x and [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.02 - x.\n        *   Kb = x² / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n        *   Kb ≈ x² / 0.02\n        *   x² ≈ Kb × 0.02\n        *   x = [OH⁻] = sqrt(Kb × 0.02)\n    *   Now, calculate pOH and then pH.\n        *   pOH = -log([OH⁻])\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH\n\nLet's compute the exact value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# Values from previous steps\nmoles_acid = 0.0010  # mol\nconc_acetate_at_eq = 0.02  # M\n\n# Calculate Kb\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-]\n# x = [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate_at_eq)\nx = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate_at_eq)\n\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npOH = -math.log10(x)\npH_at_equivalence = 14.00 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"The pH at the equivalence point is: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\n*Code execution result:*\n```\nThe pH at the equivalence point is: 8.52\n```\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n---\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated pH values are 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point.
