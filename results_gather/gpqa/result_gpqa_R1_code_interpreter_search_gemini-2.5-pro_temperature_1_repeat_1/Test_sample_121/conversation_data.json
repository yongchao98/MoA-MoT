    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction is an α-bromination of acetic acid. While the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction uses PBr3, the combination of acetic anhydride, pyridine, and Br2 achieves the same outcome. Acetic anhydride likely forms a mixed anhydride with acetic acid, which enolizes more readily. Pyridine acts as a base to facilitate enolization and neutralize the HBr byproduct.\n*   **Product 1:** The bromine atom substitutes one of the α-hydrogens of acetic acid.\n    CH3COOH → BrCH2COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst (H2SO4) to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by the ethoxy group from ethanol.\n    BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH → BrCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3), sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is an excellent nucleophile, and it displaces the bromide ion (a good leaving group) from the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:**\n    BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NCCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequential double alkylation reaction leading to cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes a proton from the carbon atom situated between the electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups. These α-protons are acidic (pKa ≈ 11).\n        NCCH2COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The resulting carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic α-proton on the newly formed intermediate.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The carbanion now attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a ring. Since the chain has 5 carbons, a stable 6-membered ring is formed. This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n     \n\n**1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals for 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. The key is to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **Chirality and Symmetry:** The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) of the cyclohexane ring is bonded to four different groups: a cyano group (-CN), an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt), C2 of the ring, and C6 of the ring. Thus, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It belongs to the C1 point group.\n\n2.  **Chemically Distinct Protons:** In a chiral molecule with no symmetry, all protons are chemically non-equivalent unless they can be interchanged by a rapid process like bond rotation. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, implying a theoretical count.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments:\n\n*   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. This will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH₂-:** These two methylene protons are diastereotopic because of the adjacent chiral center (C1). The chiral center is four bonds away (-CH₂-O-C(=O)-C₁). In a strict theoretical sense, they are in different chemical environments and should give **2 distinct signals**. However, in introductory and intermediate level problems, it is a common simplification to consider diastereotopic protons on a flexible side chain distant from the chiral center as being practically equivalent (isochronous) and giving a single signal. Let's evaluate both possibilities.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The ring has 5 methylene (CH₂) groups at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    *   Since there is no plane of symmetry, the environment of C2 is different from C6, and C3 is different from C5. All five CH₂ groups are non-equivalent.\n    *   Within each CH₂ group in the chiral ring, the two geminal protons (one 'axial-like' and one 'equatorial-like' in the chair conformations) are diastereotopic. They are chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   Therefore, each of the 5 CH₂ groups will contribute 2 distinct proton signals.\n    *   Total signals from the ring = 5 CH₂ groups × 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n\n**Total Signal Count:**\n\n*   **Strict Theoretical Count:** 1 (from CH₃) + 2 (from diastereotopic -OCH₂-) + 10 (from ring) = **13 signals**.\n*   This number is not among the options (A) 5, B) 10, C) 8, D) 12).\n\n*   **Count with Common Simplification:** The options provided suggest that a simplification is expected. The most reasonable one is to treat the two diastereotopic protons of the ethyl group's -OCH₂- as having the same chemical shift, as their non-equivalence is often small due to distance and flexibility.\n    *   If we count the -OCH₂- protons as one signal:\n    *   Total signals = 1 (from CH₃) + 1 (from -OCH₂-) + 10 (from ring) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis matches option D. The parenthetical note in the question is slightly ambiguous, but the available choices strongly point toward this interpretation, where the clear and significant non-equivalence of the 10 ring protons is counted, but the minor non-equivalence of the side-chain methylene protons is ignored.\n\n<<<D>>>"
