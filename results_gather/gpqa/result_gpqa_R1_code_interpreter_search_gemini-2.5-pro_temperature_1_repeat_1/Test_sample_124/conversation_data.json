    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System:** The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means that the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all three directions (x, y, z).\n\n2.  **Recall the Energy Eigenvalues:** For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy eigenvalues are quantized and given by the formula:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $n$ is the principal quantum number, which can take non-negative integer values: $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Excited States:**\n    *   The **ground state** corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which is for $n=0$.\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   The **first excited state** corresponds to the next energy level, which is for $n=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{5}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   The **second excited state** corresponds to $n=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{7}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   The **third excited state** corresponds to $n=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n\n    So, the value of the energy for the third excited state is **$(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Degeneracy:** The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) that have the same energy. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the principal quantum number $n$ is related to the quantum numbers of the three independent 1D oscillators in Cartesian coordinates by $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers.\n\n    The degeneracy of the energy level $E_n$ is the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ that sum up to $n$. The general formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, is:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Degeneracy for the Third Excited State (n=3):**\n    We need to find the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy $E_3$, which corresponds to $n=3$. Using the degeneracy formula:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$\n\n    Alternatively, we can list all possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n    *   Combinations of the form (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) — 3 states\n    *   Combinations of the form (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) — 6 states\n    *   Combinations of the form (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) — 1 state\n    Total number of states = 3 + 6 + 1 = **10**.\n\n    Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, and the degeneracy is 10. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
