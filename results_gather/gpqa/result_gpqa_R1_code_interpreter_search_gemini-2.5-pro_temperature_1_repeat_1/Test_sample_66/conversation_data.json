    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the initial state:** The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2.\n    *   $l = 2$: total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the 2-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$: the magnetic quantum number corresponding to the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Understand the measurement:** A measurement is performed on the z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, represented by the operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n\n3.  **Understand the desired outcome:** We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ to be $-\\hbar$ AND the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is given by $m_l \\hbar$.\n    *   So, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l_1} = -1$.\n    *   Similarly, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l_2} = -1$.\n\n4.  **Relate the total and individual angular momenta:** The total orbital angular momentum operator is the sum of the individual operators: $\\vec{L} = \\vec{L_1} + \\vec{L_2}$.\n    This also applies to their components. For the z-component, we have: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n\n5.  **Apply the principles of quantum mechanics:**\n    *   The state of the system, $|l, m> = |2, -1>$, is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z$.\n    *   This means that if we measure the total z-component of the angular momentum, $L_z$, the result will *always* be the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    *   Since $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, the sum of the eigenvalues measured for $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ must equal the eigenvalue of $L_z$.\n    *   Let the measured eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ be $m_{l_1}\\hbar$ and the measured eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ be $m_{l_2}\\hbar$.\n    *   Then, we must have the condition: $m_{l_1}\\hbar + m_{l_2}\\hbar = m\\hbar$.\n    *   Dividing by $\\hbar$, we get the selection rule for the magnetic quantum numbers: $m_{l_1} + m_{l_2} = m$.\n\n6.  **Check if the desired outcome is possible:**\n    *   The system is in a state with $m = -1$.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome is $m_{l_1} = -1$ and $m_{l_2} = -1$.\n    *   Let's check if this outcome satisfies the selection rule:\n        $m_{l_1} + m_{l_2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   We compare this sum to the system's total magnetic quantum number: $-2 \\neq -1$.\n    *   The desired outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n7.  **Determine the probability:** An outcome that violates a fundamental conservation law is impossible. The probability of an impossible event is 0.\n\n**Alternative Method using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:**\n\nThe probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_{l_1}>|l_2, m_{l_2}>$ when it is in the coupled state $|l, m>$ is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n$P(m_{l_1}, m_{l_2}) = |<l_1, m_{l_1}, l_2, m_{l_2} | l, m>|^2$.\n\nWe want to find the probability for $m_{l_1} = -1$ and $m_{l_2} = -1$.\n$P(-1, -1) = |<1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2$.\n\nA fundamental property of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are zero unless $m = m_{l_1} + m_{l_2}$.\nIn our case, $m = -1$ and $m_{l_1} + m_{l_2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\nSince $-1 \\neq -2$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero: $<1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1> = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the probability is $P(-1, -1) = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\n<<<B>>>"
