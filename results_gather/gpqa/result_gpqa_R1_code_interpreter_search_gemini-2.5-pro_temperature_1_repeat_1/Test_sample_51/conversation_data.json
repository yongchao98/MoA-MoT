    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio of atomic populations in two different energy levels changes when a star's temperature changes due to spots. Specifically, it asks for the ratio (Population Ratio without spots) / (Population Ratio with spots).\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principle:** The problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). In LTE, the distribution of atoms among different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two energy levels (level 2, the higher energy level, and level 1, the lower energy level) is given by:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    Where:\n    *   N₂/N₁ is the population ratio.\n    *   g₂/g₁ is the ratio of the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels, a constant for this specific transition.\n    *   ΔE = E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature of the photosphere.\n\n4.  **Define the Ratios for Both Scenarios:**\n    *   Let T₁ be the temperature without spots: T₁ = 6000 K.\n    *   Let T₂ be the effective temperature with spots: T₂ = 5500 K.\n    *   The population ratio without spots is: R₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n    *   The population ratio with spots is: R₂ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Factor:** The question asks for the factor of change \"when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots,\" which corresponds to the ratio R₁ / R₂.\n    Factor = R₁ / R₂ = [(g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))] / [(g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n    The term (g₂/g₁) cancels out.\n    Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n    Using the properties of exponents (exp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a-b)):\n    Factor = exp( -ΔE/(k*T₁) + ΔE/(k*T₂) )\n    Factor = exp( (ΔE/k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) )\n\n6.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy difference is related to the wavelength (λ) of the photon emitted or absorbed during the transition: ΔE = h * c / λ.\n    *   h = Planck's constant\n    *   c = speed of light\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ meters.\n    We need the term ΔE/k:\n    ΔE/k = (h * c) / (λ * k)\n\n7.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:** We will use a Python script to compute the values with high precision.\n    *   T₁ = 6000 K\n    *   T₂ = 5500 K\n    *   λ = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   h ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   c ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   k ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n\n    The script will calculate `exp( (h*c/(λ*k)) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) )`.\n\n8.  **Interpret the Unused Information:** The star's radius (1.5 R_sun), mass (1.1 M_sun), and the spot coverage (40%) are not needed for this calculation. The problem provides the direct consequence of the spots—the change in effective temperature from 6000 K to 5500 K. Using the effective temperature as the characteristic temperature for the photosphere in the Boltzmann equation is a standard approximation in such problems. The extra information is likely included as a distractor. The problem statement \"the ratio ... decreases when the star has spots\" is consistent with our formula, as a lower temperature (T₂) results in a smaller population ratio for the upper energy level.\n\nNow, let's execute the Python code to get the final numerical answer.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Physical constants in SI units\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J.s\nc = 2.99792458e8   # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23   # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Given parameters from the problem\nT_nospots = 6000.0   # Temperature without spots in Kelvin\nT_spots = 5500.0     # Temperature with spots in Kelvin\nwavelength_A = 1448.0 # Wavelength in Angstroms\nwavelength_m = wavelength_A * 1e-10 # Convert wavelength to meters\n\n# Calculate the energy difference (Delta E) between the two levels\ndelta_E = h * c / wavelength_m\n\n# The ratio of populations is R = C * exp(-delta_E / (k * T)).\n# We need to find the factor F = R_nospots / R_spots.\n# F = exp(-delta_E / (k * T_nospots)) / exp(-delta_E / (k * T_spots))\n# F = exp( (delta_E / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) )\n\n# Calculate the factor\nfactor = np.exp((delta_E / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots))\n\nprint(f\"The factor by which the ratio changes is: {factor}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nThe factor by which the ratio changes is: 4.50280436881773\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.50.

    "The reasoning and calculation performed in the previous step are correct. The python script calculated the factor by which the ratio of atomic populations changes.\n\n1.  **Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of populations N₂/N₁ is proportional to `exp(-ΔE / (kT))`.\n2.  **Ratio of Ratios:** We need to find the factor `(Ratio at T_nospots) / (Ratio at T_spots)`.\n    *   `Ratio_nospots = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))`\n    *   `Ratio_spots = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))`\n3.  **Factor Calculation:**\n    `Factor = Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots`\n    `Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))`\n    `Factor = exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) )`\n4.  **Numerical Values:**\n    *   T_nospots = 6000 K\n    *   T_spots = 5500 K\n    *   λ = 1448 Å\n    *   The energy difference `ΔE` is calculated from the wavelength `λ` using `ΔE = hc/λ`.\n5.  **Code Execution Result:** The Python code executed these calculations and yielded a result of approximately 4.50.\n\nThis numerical result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
