    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Treatment Process**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts is passed through three tubes. We need to understand the function of each tube to identify the components of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂** is a powerful drying agent. Its mass increase is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O absorbed = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater)** is used to detect and absorb acidic gases, such as CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change. This indicates that no acidic gases were present in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)** reacts with oxidizing agents, most commonly oxygen (O₂). The problem states CuO is formed, confirming a reaction with an oxygen-containing species. The mass increase of the tube is the mass of the element that combined with the copper.\n    *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO (or Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂). In both cases, the mass increase is due to oxygen atoms.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) gained = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas C did not react with the drying agent, limewater, or hot copper. This strongly suggests that gas C is nitrogen (N₂), a common, relatively inert product of the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nBased on the products, we can determine the composition of the initial salt mixture. The products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. (Even if the oxygen source was N₂O, it would decompose to N₂ and O atoms which react with Cu, so the elemental accounting remains the same).\n\n*   **Total moles of H atoms:** In 0.20 mol of H₂O, there are 0.20 * 2 = 0.40 mol of H atoms.\n*   **Total moles of O atoms:** In 0.20 mol of H₂O and from the 0.05 mol of O atoms that reacted with copper, the total is 0.20 * 1 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol of O atoms.\n*   **Total moles of N atoms:** In 0.10 mol of N₂, there are 0.10 * 2 = 0.20 mol of N atoms.\n\nNow, let's verify the total mass based on this elemental composition:\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol * 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol * 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol * 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass = 0.40 + 4.00 + 2.80 = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the salt mixture, confirming our analysis of the products is correct. The salts A and B are composed only of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states that A and B are salts in an equimolar mixture. Since they contain N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of oxygen acids of nitrogen. The most common ones are:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. We need to check if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these two salts produces the observed amounts of products. Let 'n' be the number of moles of each salt.\n\n*   **Decomposition of NH₄NO₂:** NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   n moles of NH₄NO₂ produce: n mol N₂ and 2n mol H₂O.\n*   **Decomposition of NH₄NO₃:** This can proceed via different pathways, but a known reaction under certain heating conditions is 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O.\n    *   n moles of NH₄NO₃ produce: n mol N₂, 0.5n mol O₂, and 2n mol H₂O.\n\nNow, let's sum the products from n moles of NH₄NO₂ and n moles of NH₄NO₃:\n*   **Total H₂O:** 2n (from A) + 2n (from B) = 4n mol\n*   **Total O₂:** 0.5n (from B) = 0.5n mol\n*   **Total N₂:** n (from A) + n (from B) = 2n mol\n\nWe can find the value of 'n' by comparing this with our experimental results:\n*   From H₂O: 4n = 0.20 mol  =>  n = 0.05 mol\n*   From O₂ (moles of O₂ gas = moles of O atoms / 2 = 0.05/2 = 0.025): 0.5n = 0.025 mol  =>  n = 0.05 mol\n*   From N₂: 2n = 0.10 mol  =>  n = 0.05 mol\n\nAll calculations consistently yield n = 0.05 mol. This confirms our hypothesis. The salts are indeed ammonium nitrite (A) and ammonium nitrate (B).\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite): NH₄NO₂**\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate): NH₄NO₃**\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\nLet's quickly verify the calculations with a Python script.\n```python\n# Constants\nM_H = 1.008  # g/mol\nM_N = 14.007 # g/mol\nM_O = 15.999 # g/mol\n\n# Molar masses of the identified salts\nM_NH4NO2 = M_N + 4 * M_H + M_N + 2 * M_O\nM_NH4NO3 = M_N + 4 * M_H + M_N + 3 * M_O\n\n# Moles of each salt determined from the experiment\nn = 0.05 # mol\n\n# Verify the total mass of the initial mixture\ncalculated_total_mass = n * M_NH4NO2 + n * M_NH4NO3\n\n# Calculate the total number of atoms in the formulas of the two salts\natoms_in_NH4NO2 = 2 + 4 + 2  # N, H, O\natoms_in_NH4NO3 = 2 + 4 + 3  # N, H, O\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_NH4NO2 + atoms_in_NH4NO3\n\nprint(f\"Calculated total mass: {calculated_total_mass:.2f} g\")\nprint(f\"Given total mass: 7.20 g\")\nprint(f\"Total number of atoms in salts A and B: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n>>>\nCalculated total mass: 7.20 g\nGiven total mass: 7.20 g\nTotal number of atoms in salts A and B: 17\n\nThe script confirms that the calculated mass matches the given mass and the total number of atoms is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**1. Deconstruction of the Experimental Setup**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gas mixture is analyzed by passing it through a series of reactive tubes. Let's analyze the function of each tube to identify the products of the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent. Its mass increase is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O absorbed = 3.60 g.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change. This is a crucial piece of information: it tells us that **no acidic gases were formed** during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper, Cu):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, which means the gas contained oxygen atoms. The mass increase of the tube corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of oxygen atoms (O) gained = 0.80 g.\n    *   The molar mass of an oxygen atom is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen most likely came from O₂ gas (in which case moles of O₂ = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol) or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** The gas that did not react in any of the tubes.\n    *   Volume of gas C = 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since this gas is inert to a strong dehydrating agent, a base, and hot copper, it is almost certainly nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Determining the Composition of the Salts**\n\nFrom the products (H₂O, N₂, and an oxygen source), we can deduce that the original salts A and B must be composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). Let's calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the 0.10 mol of N₂. Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and in the gas that reacted with copper. Moles of O = (moles in H₂O) + (moles reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet's check if the mass of these elements adds up to the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 + 2.80 + 4.00 = 7.20 g.\nThe calculated mass matches the given mass, confirming our analysis.\n\n**3. Identifying Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. Common salts with these elements are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids, such as ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains an equal number of moles ('n') of salt A and salt B.\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the salts are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃.\n*   Salt A: NH₄NO₂ (contains 2 N, 4 H, 2 O)\n*   Salt B: NH₄NO₃ (contains 2 N, 4 H, 3 O)\n\nLet's check if the total elemental moles match our findings for an equimolar mixture of these two salts.\n*   Total moles of H = n × (4) + n × (4) = 8n. We found 0.40 mol of H. So, 8n = 0.40  => n = 0.05 mol.\n*   Total moles of N = n × (2) + n × (2) = 4n. We found 0.20 mol of N. So, 4n = 0.20  => n = 0.05 mol.\n*   Total moles of O = n × (2) + n × (3) = 5n. We found 0.25 mol of O. So, 5n = 0.25  => n = 0.05 mol.\n\nAll calculations consistently give n = 0.05 mol. This confirms that the equimolar mixture consists of 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrite and 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrate.\n\nThe decomposition reactions that produce the observed products are:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n**4. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two identified salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
