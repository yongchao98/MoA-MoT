    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   The scenario involves two different mean free paths (MFP), λ1 and λ2, within the same TEM sample compartment.\n    *   The physical conditions (pressure, temperature, gas composition, and therefore number density 'n' of gas molecules) are identical for both measurements.\n    *   **λ1:** The mean free path of *gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules*. This is the standard definition of MFP in kinetic gas theory.\n    *   **λ2:** The mean free path of *beam electrons colliding with gas molecules*. This is the MFP for a beam of particles passing through a target gas.\n    *   The question asks to compare the values of λ1 and λ2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formulas for Mean Free Path:**\n    *   The general formula for MFP is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where 'n' is the number density of target particles and 'σ' is the collision cross-section.\n    *   **For λ1 (gas-gas collisions):** In a gas where all particles are moving randomly, we must account for their relative motion. The standard formula from kinetic theory applies:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_gas-gas` = the collision cross-section for one gas molecule with another. This is related to the physical size of the molecules. In a simple hard-sphere model, σ_gas-gas = πd², where 'd' is the molecular diameter.\n        *   The `√2` factor is crucial and arises from averaging over all possible relative velocities of the colliding gas molecules.\n\n    *   **For λ2 (electron-gas collisions):** In this case, we have a high-energy, directional beam of electrons traveling through a gas of comparatively stationary molecules. (The electron velocity at 1000 keV is a significant fraction of the speed of light, while the gas molecules have much lower thermal velocities). Therefore, we can use the simpler formula for a beam hitting a stationary target:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas)\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules (same as before).\n        *   `σ_e-gas` = the scattering cross-section for an electron with a gas molecule.\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ):**\n    *   `σ_gas-gas` represents the effective area for a physical collision between two molecules. It's determined by their size (e.g., van der Waals radius).\n    *   `σ_e-gas` represents the effective area for an electron to be scattered by a gas molecule. An electron is essentially a point particle. The scattering is an electrostatic interaction with the molecule's electron cloud and nucleus.\n    *   Crucially, for a high-energy electron (1000 kV), the probability of interaction is much lower than for two bulky molecules hitting each other. The electron can pass through the atomic structure without interaction much more easily. Therefore, the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is significantly *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section for two gas molecules.\n    *   So, we can conclude: **σ_e-gas < σ_gas-gas**.\n\n4.  **Combine the Formulas and the Cross-Section Comparison:**\n    *   We have:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas)\n    *   Let's look at the denominators:\n        *   Denominator of λ1: √2 * n * σ_gas-gas\n        *   Denominator of λ2: n * σ_e-gas\n    *   Since σ_e-gas is smaller than σ_gas-gas, and √2 is greater than 1, the entire denominator for λ1 is significantly larger than the denominator for λ2.\n        (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas) > (n * σ_e-gas)\n    *   Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to its denominator, a larger denominator means a smaller MFP.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently conclude that **λ2 > λ1**.\n\n5.  **Perform a Quantitative Estimate:**\n    *   Let's find the ratio λ2 / λ1:\n        λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_e-gas)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)]\n        λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas) / (n * σ_e-gas)\n        λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gas-gas / σ_e-gas)\n    *   We already established that σ_gas-gas > σ_e-gas, which means the ratio (σ_gas-gas / σ_e-gas) is a number greater than 1.\n    *   Therefore: λ2 / λ1 > √2\n    *   Since √2 ≈ 1.414, we have **λ2 / λ1 > 1.414**.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1  --> This means 1 < λ2/λ1 < 1.22. This is incorrect because our physics-based derivation shows λ2/λ1 must be greater than 1.414.\n    *   B) λ2 < λ1 --> This is incorrect. The electron's mean free path is longer.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 --> This means λ2/λ1 >= 1.22. This statement is consistent with our finding that λ2/λ1 > 1.414.\n    *   D) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation --> This is incorrect. There is a clear physical reason for the mean free paths to be different.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The mean free path of the electrons (λ2) is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules among themselves (λ1). This is due to two factors: (1) the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is smaller than the gas-kinetic cross-section, and (2) the formula for gas-gas MFP includes a √2 factor in the denominator that is absent in the beam-gas formula. Both effects make λ2 larger than λ1. Our calculation shows λ2 is at least 1.414 times larger than λ1. Option C is the only one that reflects this reality.\n\n<<<C>>>"
