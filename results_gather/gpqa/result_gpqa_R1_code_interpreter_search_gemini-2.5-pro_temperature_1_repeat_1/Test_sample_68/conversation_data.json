    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the minimum resolution needed by the CERN Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Physics:**\n    *   A particle moving at a relativistic speed has a longer lifetime in the lab frame compared to its proper lifetime. This is due to time dilation.\n    *   The number of particles that decay over time (or distance) follows an exponential decay law.\n    *   \"Observing a decay\" implies that the detector can resolve the track length of the particle before it decayed. This means the particle's travel distance, `d`, must be greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`.\n    *   Therefore, the problem asks for a resolution `d_res` such that the fraction of particles traveling a distance `d > d_res` before decaying is 30%.\n\n3.  **List Given Information:**\n    *   Proper lifetime of $X^0$: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n    *   Total energy of $X^0$ in the lab frame: $E = 27$ GeV.\n    *   Rest mass energy of $X^0$: $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV.\n    *   Speed of light: $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Equations:**\n    *   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor relates the energy and rest mass, and also describes time dilation.\n        $E = \\gamma m_0c^2 \\implies \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$\n    *   **Lifetime in Lab Frame ($\\tau$):** The observed lifetime is dilated by the Lorentz factor.\n        $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    *   **Mean Decay Length (L):** This is the average distance the particle travels before decaying in the lab frame. For a highly relativistic particle, its velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n        $L = v \\cdot \\tau \\approx c \\cdot \\tau = c \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    *   **Decay Probability:** The probability that a particle survives (does not decay) after traveling a distance `d` is given by the exponential decay law:\n        $P(survival, d) = e^{-d/L}$\n    *   **Condition for Observation:** We need to find the resolution `d_res` such that the probability of a particle traveling further than `d_res` is 30% (0.3).\n        $P(d > d_{res}) = P(survival, d_{res}) = 0.3$\n        $e^{-d_{res}/L} = 0.3$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Resolution (`d_res`):**\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the probability equation:\n        $\\ln(e^{-d_{res}/L}) = \\ln(0.3)$\n        $-d_{res}/L = \\ln(0.3)$\n        $d_{res} = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.3) = L \\cdot \\ln(1/0.3)$\n    *   Substitute the expression for L:\n        $d_{res} = (c \\gamma \\tau_0) \\cdot \\ln(1/0.3)$\n        $d_{res} = c \\cdot \\left(\\frac{E}{m_0c^2}\\right) \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\ln(1/0.3)$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:** Now, we plug in the given values. This calculation is best performed with a script to maintain precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values from the problem statement\ntau_0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nE = 27         # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41    # Rest mass energy in GeV\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = E / m0c2\n\n# Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame (L)\n# L = c * gamma * tau_0\nL = c * gamma * tau_0\n\n# The resolution (d_res) is the distance such that 30% of particles travel further.\n# This is derived from the decay probability formula: exp(-d_res / L) = 0.3\n# Solving for d_res gives: d_res = L * ln(1/0.3)\nresolution = L * np.log(1 / 0.3)\n\nprint(f\"{resolution:.2e}\")\n```\n\n> **Execution Output:**\n> ```\n> 2.29e-06\n> ```\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated resolution is $2.29 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.

The minor difference is likely due to the precise value of `c` used or slight rounding in the problem's intended answer. The order of magnitude and the leading digit are a clear match.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum resolution a detector needs to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle. In this context, observing a decay means the particle travels a distance `d` that is greater than the detector's resolution (`d_res`) before it decays. The detector cannot resolve tracks shorter than its resolution.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Proper lifetime of $X^0$: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n    *   Total energy of $X^0$ in the lab frame: $E = 27$ GeV.\n    *   Rest mass of $X^0$: $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV.\n    *   The condition: At least 30% of decays must be observed.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Effects:** The $X^0$ particle is moving at a relativistic speed. We need to account for time dilation and the corresponding increase in its travel distance in the lab frame (the frame of the Bubble Chamber).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy to its rest mass energy.\n    $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.9179$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Mean Lifetime in the Lab Frame ($\\tau$):** Due to time dilation, the lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab is longer than its proper lifetime.\n    $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0 = 7.9179 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 6.3343 \\times 10^{-15}$ s\n\n6.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. Since the particle is highly relativistic ($\\gamma \\approx 7.9$), its velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. We can approximate $v \\approx c$.\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau \\approx c \\cdot \\tau = c \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$\n\n7.  **Formulate the Decay Probability:** The number of particles that survive after traveling a distance `d` follows an exponential decay law, $N(d) = N_0 e^{-d/L}$. The probability of a single particle traveling a distance `d` or more before decaying is:\n    $P(\\text{survival, d}) = e^{-d/L}$\n\n8.  **Apply the Observation Condition:** We need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means that for at least 30% of the particles, their travel distance `d` must be greater than the resolution `d_res`.\n    $P(d > d_{res}) \\ge 0.30$\n    $e^{-d_{res}/L} \\ge 0.30$\n\n9.  **Solve for the Resolution (`d_res`):** The question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed\". This corresponds to the boundary condition of the inequality. A smaller (better) resolution will observe more particles, but we need the limiting value. This means we are looking for the maximum permissible value of `d_res` that still satisfies the condition.\n    $e^{-d_{res}/L} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $\\ln(e^{-d_{res}/L}) = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $-d_{res}/L = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d_{res} = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.30) = L \\cdot \\ln(1/0.30)$\n\n10. **Calculate the Numerical Value:** Now, we substitute the expression for L and the given values to find the resolution. We will use a python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\ntau_0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nE = 27         # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41    # Rest mass energy in GeV\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# 1. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = E / m0c2\n\n# 2. Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame (L)\n# We use the approximation v ~ c, which is very accurate for high gamma.\nL = c * gamma * tau_0\n\n# 3. Solve for the resolution (d_res) based on the observation condition.\n# The fraction of decays observed is the fraction of particles traveling further than d_res.\n# exp(-d_res / L) >= 0.3  => d_res <= L * ln(1/0.3)\n# The required resolution is the threshold value.\nresolution = L * np.log(1 / 0.3)\n\nprint(f\"{resolution:.3e}\")\n```\n> **Execution Output:**\n> ```\n> 2.286e-06\n> ```\n\n11. **Compare with Options:** The calculated resolution is $2.286 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's compare this to the given options:\n    A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n    B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n    C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n    D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\nThe calculated value ($2.286 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is very close to option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). They share the same order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$). The ~10% difference likely stems from a slight imprecision in the values given in the problem statement. Given the choices, C is the only physically plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
