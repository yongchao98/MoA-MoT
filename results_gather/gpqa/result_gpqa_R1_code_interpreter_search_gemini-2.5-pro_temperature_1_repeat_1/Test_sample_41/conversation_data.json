    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet in a circular orbit around a star is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n    In this problem, all three exoplanets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant for all three. We are also told that the albedo ($A$) is the same for all three planets. Therefore, the terms $T_{star}$, $R_{star}$, and $(1 - A)$ are constant across the system. This simplifies the relationship to:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{a} \\right)^{1/2}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n2.  **Use the temperature ratios to find the ratios of the orbital distances.**\n    From the relationship $T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{a}$, we can write the ratio of temperatures for two planets (Planet X and Planet Y) as:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,X}}{T_{eq,Y}} = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{a_X}}{1/\\sqrt{a_Y}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_Y}{a_X}}$\n\n    We are given the following temperature ratios:\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = 1.4$\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 2.3$\n\n    Using the formula, we can find the ratios of the orbital distances:\n    *   For Planet1 and Planet2: $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = 1.4 \\implies \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 1.4^2 = 1.96$\n    *   For Planet2 and Planet3: $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_3}{a_2}} = 2.3 \\implies \\frac{a_3}{a_2} = 2.3^2 = 5.29$\n\n3.  **Calculate the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to Planet1 ($a_3/a_1$).**\n    We can find this by multiplying the individual ratios:\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$\n\n4.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of the orbital periods.**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that for objects orbiting the same central body, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    This can be written as $P \\propto a^{3/2}$.\n\n    The ratio of the orbital periods of Planet3 and Planet1 is therefore:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{a_3}{a_1}\\right)^{3/2}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the final value.**\n    Substitute the value of $a_3/a_1$ we found in step 3:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}$\n\n    We can perform this calculation to find the final factor.\n    \nLet's use a Python script to compute the final value accurately.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given ratios of equilibrium temperatures\nT1_over_T2 = 1.4\nT2_over_T3 = 2.3\n\n# From T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(a), we have (T_x/T_y)^2 = a_y/a_x.\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes a2/a1 and a3/a2.\na2_over_a1 = T1_over_T2**2\na3_over_a2 = T2_over_T3**2\n\n# Calculate the total ratio of semi-major axes a3/a1.\na3_over_a1 = a3_over_a2 * a2_over_a1\n\n# From Kepler's Third Law, P ∝ a^(3/2).\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods P3/P1.\nP3_over_P1 = a3_over_a1**(3/2)\n\nprint(P3_over_P1)\n```\n<execute_result>\n33.386248000000004\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\nThe information about the TTV method and the mass ratios is extraneous, as the planets' masses are negligible compared to their host star's mass in the standard application of Kepler's Third Law for this type of problem.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is related to its orbital distance (semi-major axis, $a$) from the star. For a planet in a circular orbit, this relationship is given by:\n\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nThis means that the square of the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the orbital distance:\n\n$T_{eq}^2 \\propto \\frac{1}{a}$ or $a \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2}$\n\nWe can use this relationship to find the ratios of the orbital distances for the planets.\n\n1.  **Find the ratio of orbital distances between Planet1 and Planet2 ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{1/T_{eq2}^2}{1/T_{eq1}^2} = \\left(\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}}\\right)^2$\n    Given $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = 1.4$,\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96$\n\n2.  **Find the ratio of orbital distances between Planet2 and Planet3 ($a_3/a_2$):**\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = \\left(\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}}\\right)^2$\n    Given $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 2.3$,\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29$\n\n3.  **Find the overall ratio of orbital distances between Planet1 and Planet3 ($a_3/a_1$):**\n    We can find this by multiplying the individual ratios:\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$\n\n4.  **Use Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of orbital periods.**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    $P \\propto a^{3/2}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods ($P_3/P_1$):**\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{a_3}{a_1}\\right)^{3/2} = (10.3684)^{3/2}$\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} \\approx 33.386$\n\nThe result is approximately 33.4. The information about the masses and the specific albedo value is not needed for this calculation, as long as the albedo is the same for all planets and the planets' masses are negligible compared to the star's mass.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~ 10.4\nB) ~ 33.4\nC) ~ 3.2\nD) ~ 4.4\n\nThe calculated factor is closest to 33.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
