    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction and equilibrium:**\n    The Ca-EDTA complex ($[CaY]^{2-}$, where Y represents the EDTA anion) is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Relate the formation constant (K_f) to the dissociation constant (K_d):**\n    The problem provides the formation constant, $K_{Ca-EDTA}$ (also known as $K_f$), which corresponds to the reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    The dissociation constant ($K_d$) for the reverse reaction is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[[CaY]^{2-}]} = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:**\n    Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions that form upon dissociation of the complex.\n    The initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| $Ca^{2+}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n| $Y^{4-}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression and solve for x:**\n    Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\n    $K_d = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n5.  **Apply a simplifying approximation:**\n    Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the dissociation constant ($K_d$) is extremely small. This implies that the complex dissociates very little, and 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M).\n    Therefore, we can approximate $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the concentration of Calcium ions (x):**\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option D.\n\nThe \"ideal pH\" condition ensures that the EDTA is fully in its $Y^{4-}$ form, allowing us to use the given absolute formation constant directly without needing pH-dependent corrections (conditional constants).\n\nTo verify the calculation, we can use a python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\n# Stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex in M\nC_complex = 0.02\n\n# Formation constant of Ca-EDTA\nK_f = 5e10\n\n# The dissociation reaction is: [CaY]2- <=> Ca2+ + Y4-\n# The dissociation constant, Kd, is the inverse of the formation constant.\nK_d = 1 / K_f\n\n# Let x be the equilibrium concentration of Ca2+ ions.\n# From the stoichiometry of the dissociation, [Y4-] is also x.\n# The equilibrium concentration of the complex is [CaY]2- = C_complex - x.\n# The equilibrium expression is: Kd = [Ca2+][Y4-] / [[CaY]2-]\n# Kd = (x * x) / (C_complex - x)\n# Since Kd is very small, x will be very small compared to C_complex.\n# So, we can approximate (C_complex - x) ≈ C_complex.\n# The equation simplifies to: Kd ≈ x^2 / C_complex\n# We can solve for x: x = sqrt(Kd * C_complex)\n\n# Calculate x\nx_squared = K_d * C_complex\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"The concentration of Ca2+ ions is approximately {x:.2e} M.\")\n```\nThe concentration of Ca2+ ions is approximately 6.32e-07 M.\nThe calculated result is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, which confirms the manual calculation and matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equilibrium:\n$[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\nThe problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$) for the reverse reaction:\n$Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n$K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nThe dissociation constant ($K_d$) for our reaction of interest is the inverse of the formation constant:\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the equilibrium concentrations.
