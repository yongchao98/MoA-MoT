    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The relationship between the populations of different energy levels and temperature is governed by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two different energy levels, `i` and `j`, as follows:\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n    Where:\n    *   `N_j` and `N_i` are the number of atoms in the higher energy state `j` and lower energy state `i`, respectively.\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights (or degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   `E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the two levels, which we can denote as `ΔE`.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Boltzmann Equation to each star:**\n    Let the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the number of atoms in the lower state be `R`.\n\n    For star_1 (with temperature T_1):\n    R_1 = (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\n    For star_2 (with temperature T_2):\n    R_2 = (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n4.  **Use the information given in the problem:** The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This translates to:\n    R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n5.  **Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship:**\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The term for the statistical weights, `(g_j / g_i)`, is the same for both stars since it's the same atomic transition. Therefore, it can be canceled from both sides:\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n7.  **Solve for the relationship between the temperatures:** To deal with the exponentials, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(exp(x)) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n8.  **Isolate ln(2):** Rearrange the equation to solve for `ln(2)`.\n    ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\n9.  **Factor and simplify the expression:** Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`.\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n10. **Analyze the numerical values:** The problem gives the energy difference `ΔE` as approximately `1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant, `k`, is known to be `1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. The problem is set up such that the numerical value of `ΔE` in Joules is essentially equal to the numerical value of `k` in J/K. This means the ratio `ΔE / k` is approximately 1 (with units of Kelvin, which makes the whole right side of the equation dimensionless, as required since `ln(2)` is dimensionless).\n\n    Therefore, we can substitute `ΔE / k ≈ 1 K` into our derived equation. The options provided do not contain the `ΔE/k` term, which confirms that we are expected to make this simplification.\n\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n11. **Compare with the given options:** This result matches option C.\n\n    A) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n    B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n    C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n    D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n\nThe correct equation is given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
