As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of Gene G2.**\n    *   The single mutant `g2` shows 0% resistance, a complete loss of the phenotype. This suggests G2 plays an essential role in the resistance pathway.\n    *   The double mutant `g1g2` also shows 0% resistance. The phenotype of the `g2` single mutant (0%) masks the phenotype of the `g1` single mutant (75%). In genetic terms, this means **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n    *   Similarly, the double mutant `g2g3` shows 0% resistance, the same as the `g2` single mutant. This means **G2 is also epistatic to G3**.\n    *   When a gene's mutation is epistatic to (masks) mutations in other genes in the same pathway, and its knockout leads to a total loss of function, it is very likely an upstream regulator that controls the expression of the other genes. The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. G2 perfectly fits this description.\n    *   **Conclusion 1: G2 is a transcription factor that acts upstream of G1 and G3.** This eliminates option B, which suggests G1 is the transcription factor.\n\n2.  **Analyze the interaction between Gene G1 and Gene G3.**\n    *   The single mutant `g1` has 75% resistance (a loss of 25%).\n    *   The single mutant `g3` has 50% resistance (a loss of 50%).\n    *   The double mutant `g1g3` has 10% resistance (a loss of 90%).\n    *   If the genes acted independently and additively, the expected loss in the double mutant would be the sum of individual losses: 25% + 50% = 75%. The expected resistance would be 100% - 75% = 25%.\n    *   The observed resistance (10%) is much lower than the expected additive resistance (25%). This type of genetic interaction, where the double mutant phenotype is much more severe than expected, is called **synergy**. It suggests that G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways that both contribute to the overall resistance.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the concept of epistasis between G1 and G3.**\n    *   For G1 to be epistatic to G3, the phenotype of the `g1g3` double mutant must be the same as the `g1` single mutant. Here, 10% resistance (`g1g3`) is not equal to 75% resistance (`g1`). So, **G1 is not epistatic to G3**.\n    *   For G3 to be epistatic to G1, the `g1g3` phenotype must equal the `g3` phenotype. Here, 10% (`g1g3`) is not equal to 50% (`g3`). So, **G3 is not epistatic to G1**.\n    *   **Conclusion 2: According to the standard definition and the provided data, there is no epistasis between G1 and G3.** This reveals a flaw in options A, C, and D, as they all make a claim about epistasis between G1 and G3. We must choose the \"best fit\" option despite this contradiction.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the remaining options (A, C, D).**\n    *   All three correctly identify G2 as the likely transcription factor.\n    *   They all make an incorrect statement about epistasis between G1 and G3. Options A and D incorrectly claim \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\". Option C incorrectly claims \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\". There might be a non-standard definition intended where the gene with the milder phenotype (`g1`) is considered epistatic, which would align with options A and D. Let's proceed by comparing the middle clause.\n    *   **Option A: \"G1 and G3 show pleiotropy.\"** Pleiotropy means a single gene affects multiple unrelated traits. While possibly true, it doesn't describe the interaction between G1 and G3 with respect to the single trait being measured (resistance). However, the single mutants have different effects (`g1` loss is 25%, `g3` loss is 50%), which shows they are functionally distinct, not identical. Pleiotropy is a property of genes with distinct functions.\n    *   **Option C: \"G1 and G3 has the same promoter.\"** This is a plausible molecular mechanism for co-regulation by the transcription factor G2, but it's a hypothesis that cannot be directly concluded from the phenotype data alone.\n    *   **Option D: \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy.\"** Gene redundancy implies that the genes have the same or very similar functions, such that one can compensate for the other. Since the `g1` and `g3` mutants have different, significant phenotypes, they are not truly redundant. \"Redundancy\" is a poor descriptor for functionally distinct genes.\n\n5.  **Select the best option.**\n    *   Comparing the middle clauses, \"redundancy\" (D) is inaccurate because the genes have different functional importance. \"Pleiotropy\" (A), while not a term for gene interaction, is consistent with G1 and G3 being functionally distinct genes that act in parallel, a conclusion supported by the data (`g1` and `g3` have different phenotypes). Given that G1 and G3 are not functionally identical, describing them as pleiotropic (capable of distinct roles) is more accurate than describing them as redundant (having the same role).\n    *   Therefore, despite the flawed epistasis claim, option A presents a combination of statements that is arguably the most plausible description of the genetic system. The first statement is strongly supported, and the second statement (\"pleiotropy\") is more consistent with the data (functionally distinct genes) than the corresponding statement in option D (\"redundancy\"). The flawed third statement is likely an error in the question that must be overlooked to find the intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
