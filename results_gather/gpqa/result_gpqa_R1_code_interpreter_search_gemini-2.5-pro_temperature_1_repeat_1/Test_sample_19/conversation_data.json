    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics.\n\n**1. Analyze the core concept: The Impulse Approximation**\n\nThe impulse approximation simplifies the complex problem of an external probe (like an electron or neutrino) interacting with a nucleus full of strongly interacting nucleons. The core idea is to treat the interaction as if it happens with a single, quasi-free nucleon, while the other nucleons are just \"spectators\". This is valid when the energy transferred in the collision is much larger than the binding energies of the nucleons and the interaction time is very short.\n\n**2. Evaluate each assumption:**\n\n*   **1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**\n    *   This is the fundamental starting point of the approximation. It assumes that the probe interacts with one nucleon at a time. It explicitly neglects more complex phenomena like meson-exchange currents (where the probe interacts with the virtual particles exchanged between nucleons) or interactions with correlated nucleon pairs. This is a cornerstone of the impulse approximation. This statement is **necessary**.\n\n*   **2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**\n    *   This addresses what happens to the particles *before* and *after* the main interaction. If the incoming probe or the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) were to interact with the other \"spectator\" nucleons, the simple picture would break down. These are called Initial-State Interactions (ISI) and Final-State Interactions (FSI). Assuming the nucleus is \"transparent\" means we are neglecting ISI and FSI. This allows us to treat the incoming and outgoing particles as simple plane waves, as in a free-particle scattering experiment. This is a key part of the simplified picture, often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA). This statement is **necessary** for the full approximation.\n\n*   **3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**\n    *   This statement concerns the *internal structure* of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation is a framework for describing the interaction at the level of *nucleons*, not quarks. It separates the problem into two parts: the nuclear dynamics (treating nucleons as quasi-free) and the nucleon's response (described by form factors). How one models these form factors (using a non-relativistic quark model, a relativistic model, or experimental data) is a separate question. The impulse approximation itself does not require a non-relativistic description of the nucleon's internals. In fact, for high-energy interactions where the impulse approximation is most valid, a relativistic description of the nucleon is often more appropriate. Therefore, this statement is **not a necessary assumption**.\n\n*   **4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**\n    *   This is the essence of treating the nucleon as \"free\". A nucleon inside a nucleus is bound by the strong nuclear force, meaning it sits in a potential well and has a binding energy. The impulse approximation posits that the interaction happens so quickly and violently that during the brief moment of collision, this binding potential is negligible compared to the interaction energy. The nucleon is \"knocked out\" before it has time to \"feel\" the pull of its neighbors. This statement is **necessary**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe three assumptions that are essential to the impulse approximation (specifically, the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation, which is the standard interpretation) are:\n1.  The interaction is with a single nucleon.\n2.  Final-state and initial-state interactions are ignored (the nucleus is transparent).\n4.  The nucleon's binding energy is ignored during the short interaction time.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n**4. Match with options:**\n*   A) 2,3,4\n*   B) 1,3,4\n*   C) 1,2,4\n*   D) 1,2,3\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
