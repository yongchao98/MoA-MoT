    "This problem requires understanding the principles of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. A key feature of this distribution is that it is \"memoryless,\" meaning the probability of a future event is independent of past events.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Model the Decay Process:**\n    Radioactive decay is a random process. The probability that an atomic nucleus survives for a time `t` is given by the survival function `S(t) = P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`, where `T` is the time of decay and `λ` is the decay constant.\n    The probability that the nucleus decays *within* a time `t` is `P(T ≤ t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information to Find a Key Parameter:**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n    *   This means `1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`.\n    *   Solving for the survival part, we get `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    This value, `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`, represents the probability of the atom surviving for 100 minutes. We can use this relationship without explicitly solving for `λ`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Question Mathematically:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, *given* that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    *   The event is: Decay occurs between `t=50` and `t=50+150=200` minutes.\n    *   The condition is: The atom has survived past `t=50` minutes (`T > 50`).\n    *   We are looking for the conditional probability: `P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50)`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:**\n    The memoryless property of exponential decay states that the time an atom has already survived does not affect its future decay probability. The probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom would decay in 150 minutes.\n    *   `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)`\n    So, the problem simplifies to calculating the probability that a new atom decays within 150 minutes.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    We need to calculate `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`.\n    We can find `e^(-150λ)` using the relationship we found in Step 2 (`e^(-100λ) = 0.68`):\n    *   `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    *   `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n    Now, we can compute this value and find the decay probability.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# From the problem statement, we know the probability of survival for 100 minutes.\n# P(decay in 100 min) = 0.32\n# P(survive > 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n# This corresponds to exp(-lambda * 100).\nsurvival_prob_100_min = 0.68\n\n# Due to the memoryless property of exponential decay, the probability of decaying\n# in the next 150 minutes is independent of the 50 minutes already passed.\n# We need to calculate the probability of decay within 150 minutes for a new atom.\n# P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - P(survive > 150 min)\n# P(survive > 150 min) = exp(-lambda * 150) = (exp(-lambda * 100))^(150/100)\n# P(survive > 150 min) = (survival_prob_100_min) ^ 1.5\n\nsurvival_prob_150_min = survival_prob_100_min ** 1.5\ndecay_prob_150_min = 1 - survival_prob_150_min\n\n# Print the result as a percentage.\nprint(f\"The calculated probability is {decay_prob_150_min * 100:.2f}%\")\n```\nThe calculated probability is 43.93%\n\nThe code output `0.4393` represents the probability. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100, which gives 43.93%. This value is closest to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
