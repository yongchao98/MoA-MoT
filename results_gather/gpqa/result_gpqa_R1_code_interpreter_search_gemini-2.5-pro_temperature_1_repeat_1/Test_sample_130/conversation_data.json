    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride. This anhydride has a very simple NMR spectrum: a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The single ¹H peak at 7 ppm suggests two chemically equivalent protons on a double bond (vinylic protons). The downfield shift is due to electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   The two ¹³C peaks correspond to the two types of carbons: the vinylic carbons (C=C, ~137 ppm) and the carbonyl carbons (C=O, ~165 ppm).\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent.\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene locked in the necessary *s-cis* conformation for a Diels-Alder reaction. The protons on this molecule are the two on the CH₂ group and the twelve on the four methyl groups.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products**\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition, a **Diels-Alder reaction**, between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   Like most Diels-Alder reactions, this one produces two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **endo rule** states that for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the major product is the *endo* isomer. In this isomer, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the newly formed bicyclic system. In this case, it's the C=C double bond bridge from the original diene. More simply, the anhydride is \"tucked under\" the diene's original π system.\n    *   The minor product is the more thermodynamically stable *exo* isomer, where the anhydride part is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side).\n    *   Therefore: **Major Product = Endo Adduct**, **Minor Product = Exo Adduct**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry and Predict NOESY Cross-Peaks**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two spatially close protons.\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n\n    Let's analyze the proton proximities in both isomers:\n    *   **Proton Groups in the Product:**\n        *   **H_fused**: The two protons on the carbons where the anhydride ring is fused. These came from the dienophile. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent.\n        *   **Me_vinyl**: The two methyl groups on the double bond (at positions C2 and C3 of the bicyclo[2.2.1] system). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent.\n        *   **Me_bridgehead**: The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent.\n        *   **CH₂_bridge**: The two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic and not equivalent.\n\n    *   **In the Endo (Major) Product:** The anhydride ring is tucked under the C2=C3 double bond. This brings the **H_fused** protons very close to the **Me_vinyl** groups. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them. The H_fused protons are far from the CH₂_bridge protons.\n\n    *   **In the Exo (Minor) Product:** The anhydride ring is pointing away from the C2=C3 double bond and towards the C7 CH₂ bridge. This brings the **H_fused** protons very close to the **CH₂_bridge** protons. An NOE cross-peak is expected between them. The H_fused protons are now far from the Me_vinyl groups.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** The NOE cross-peak between **H_fused** and **Me_vinyl** is unique to the major (*endo*) product, and it will be absent (or very weak) in the minor (*exo*) product. This matches the description in the question.\n\n4.  **Assign NMR Signals and Identify the Correct Option**\n    *   Now we need to assign the proton groups to the chemical shifts and multiplicities given in the options.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**: This corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups on saturated sp³ carbons, which are the **Me_bridgehead** groups.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: This corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups on a C=C double bond, which are the **Me_vinyl** groups. Their shift is downfield from the other methyls due to the double bond's anisotropy.\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: This corresponds to the two equivalent **H_fused** protons. They are alpha to two carbonyl groups, which strongly deshields them, justifying the ~3.5 ppm shift. Their equivalence leads to a singlet.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**: This corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic **CH₂_bridge** protons.\n\n    *   The NOE cross-peak unique to the major product is between **H_fused** and **Me_vinyl**.\n    *   Based on our assignments, this is a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - **This matches our conclusion.**\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) - These are not uniquely close in the endo isomer.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (CH₂_bridge) - These are reasonably close in both isomers.\n        *   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (CH₂_bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_fused) - This cross-peak is characteristic of the *minor (exo)* product, not the major one.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the major product connects the resonances of the vinylic methyl groups and the protons on the fused anhydride ring.\n\n<<<A>>>"
