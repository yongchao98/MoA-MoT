    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe problem describes the detection of exoplanets using the Radial Velocity (RV) method, also known as the Doppler wobble method. Here's how it works:\n*   An orbiting planet exerts a gravitational pull on its host star, causing the star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass.\n*   This wobble means the star moves slightly towards and away from an observer on Earth.\n*   When the star moves towards us, its light is blueshifted (wavelengths become shorter). When it moves away, its light is redshifted (wavelengths become longer).\n*   By observing the periodic shift in the star's spectral lines, we can infer the presence of a planet.\n\nThe key relationship is that the magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_star) along our line of sight.\nΔλ / λ₀ = v_star / c\nwhere λ₀ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe problem gives the *maximum* periodic shift, which corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star. This maximum velocity is called the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, denoted by K.\n\nTherefore, we can establish a direct proportionality:\nK ∝ Δλ\n\n### 2. Relate Observables to Physical Quantities\n\nWe are given:\n*   Maximum wavelength shift for Planet #1 system: Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n*   Maximum wavelength shift for Planet #2 system: Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n\nFrom the proportionality K ∝ Δλ, we can find the ratio of the stellar velocity semi-amplitudes:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n### 3. Derive the Relationship Between Stellar Velocity (K) and Orbital Period (T)\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the observed semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity is given by the formula:\nK = (m_p / M_star) * v_p\nwhere `m_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `v_p` is the planet's orbital velocity. (This is derived from the conservation of momentum, `M_star * v_star = m_p * v_p`, where `v_star` is the star's velocity, which has a maximum value of K).\n\nThe planet's orbital velocity `v_p` is determined by its orbital period `T` and the semi-major axis `a` (which is the radius for a circular orbit):\nv_p = 2πa / T\n\nWe can relate `a` and `T` using Kepler's Third Law:\nT² = (4π² / (G * (M_star + m_p))) * a³\n\nSince the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (m_p << M_star), we can simplify this to:\nT² ≈ (4π² / (G * M_star)) * a³\n\nLet's rearrange this to express `a` in terms of `T`:\na³ ≈ (G * M_star * T²) / (4π²)\na ≈ (G * M_star * T² / (4π²))^(1/3)\n\nNow substitute this expression for `a` back into the equation for `v_p`:\nv_p = 2π / T * (G * M_star * T² / (4π²))^(1/3)\nv_p = ( (2π)³ / T³ * (G * M_star * T² / (4π²)) )^(1/3)\nv_p = ( (8π³) / T³ * (G * M_star * T² / (4π²)) )^(1/3)\nv_p = ( (2π * G * M_star) / T )^(1/3)\n\nFinally, substitute this `v_p` back into the formula for K:\nK = (m_p / M_star) * ( (2π * G * M_star) / T )^(1/3)\nK = m_p * M_star⁻¹ * (2πG)^(1/3) * M_star^(1/3) * T⁻⁽¹/³⁾\nK = ( (2πG)^(1/3) * m_p * M_star⁻⁽²/³⁾ ) * T⁻⁽¹/³⁾\n\n### 4. Use the Derived Relationship to Find the Period Ratio\n\nThe term in the parentheses depends on G (a constant), `m_p`, and `M_star`. The problem states:\n*   The stars have the same mass (M_star1 = M_star2).\n*   The planets have similar masses (m_p1 ≈ m_p2).\n\nThis means the entire term in the parentheses is a constant for both systems. Let's call it C.\nK ≈ C * T⁻⁽¹/³⁾\n\nThis gives us the crucial relationship: **K is proportional to T⁻⁽¹/³⁾**.\n\nWe can write this for both systems:\nK₁ = C * T₁⁻⁽¹/³⁾\nK₂ = C * T₂⁻⁽¹/³⁾\n\nNow, let's find the ratio T₂ / T₁:\nK₂ / K₁ = (C * T₂⁻⁽¹/³⁾) / (C * T₁⁻⁽¹/³⁾)\nK₂ / K₁ = (T₂ / T₁)⁻⁽¹/³⁾\nK₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)⁽¹/³⁾\n\nTo solve for T₂ / T₁, we can cube both sides and then take the reciprocal:\n(K₂ / K₁)³ = T₁ / T₂\nT₂ / T₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n### 5. Calculate the Final Answer\n\nWe already know the ratio of the velocities from the wavelength shifts:\nK₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5\nTherefore, K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7.\n\nSubstitute this into our final equation:\nT₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³\nT₂ / T₁ = 5³ / 7³\nT₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343\n\nTo find the decimal value, we perform the division.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the final numerical value for the ratio of the periods.\n# T2/T1 = (K1/K2)^3, and K1/K2 = 5/7.\nratio_T = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio_T)\n```\n> 실행 결과\n```\n0.3644314868804665\n```\n\nThe calculation shows that T₂ / T₁ ≈ 0.364.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.40\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 0.36\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nThe value 0.364 is closest to 0.36.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants to find the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Connection between Wavelength Shift and Stellar Velocity:**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method relies on the Doppler effect. The change in a star's light wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to its velocity (v) along our line of sight. The problem gives the *maximum periodic shift*, which corresponds to the maximum velocity of the star, known as the velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n    Therefore, we have the relationship:\n    K ∝ Δλ\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of Stellar Velocities:**\n    We are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    *   Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ for the star hosting planet #1.\n    *   Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ for the star hosting planet #2.\n\n    From the proportionality K ∝ Δλ, we can find the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5\n\n3.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to the Planet's Orbital Period (T):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by a formula that depends on the planet's mass (m_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the planet's orbital period (T). Let's derive the relationship.\n\n    *   From the conservation of momentum (in the center-of-mass frame), the star's velocity (v_star) is related to the planet's velocity (v_planet) by: M_star * v_star = m_p * v_planet. The maximum value of v_star is K, so we can write: K ≈ (m_p / M_star) * v_planet.\n    *   The planet's orbital velocity is v_planet = 2πa / T, where 'a' is the orbital radius (semi-major axis).\n    *   From Kepler's Third Law for a planet much less massive than its star, T² ∝ a³. This means a ∝ T^(2/3).\n    *   Substituting 'a' into the velocity equation: v_planet ∝ T^(2/3) / T = T^(-1/3).\n    *   Combining these relationships, we get: K ∝ v_planet ∝ T^(-1/3).\n\n    So, the key proportionality is: **K ∝ T^(-1/3)**.\n\n    This holds because the problem states that the star masses are identical (M_star1 = M_star2) and the planet masses are similar (m_p1 ≈ m_p2), so all other factors in the full equation cancel out when we take a ratio.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods:**\n    Using the proportionality K ∝ T^(-1/3), we can write the ratio for our two systems:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (T₂ / T₁)⁻⁽¹/³⁾\n\n    We can rewrite this as:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)⁽¹/³⁾\n\n    To solve for the desired ratio T₂ / T₁, we first cube both sides:\n    (K₂ / K₁)³ = T₁ / T₂\n\n    Now, we take the reciprocal of both sides to get T₂ / T₁:\n    T₂ / T₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    We already found that K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5. This means K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7.\n    Substitute this into our final equation:\n    T₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    T₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343\n\n    The Python script confirmed the numerical result:\n    125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated ratio is approximately 0.364. This matches option C.\n\n    *   A) ~ 1.40\n    *   B) ~ 1.96\n    *   C) ~ 0.36\n    *   D) ~ 0.85\n\n<<<C>>>"
