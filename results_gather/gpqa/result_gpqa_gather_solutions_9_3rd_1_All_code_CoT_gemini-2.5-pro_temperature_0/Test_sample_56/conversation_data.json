Identify the Governing Formula\nThe question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the forward direction (along the incident beam, where the scattering angle $\\theta=0$). The correct formula, derived from the partial wave expansion and the Optical Theorem, is:\n$$ \\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} (2l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l) $$\nwhere $k$ is the wave number of the incident electron and $\\delta_l$ are the phase shifts. The problem specifies to sum from $l=0$ to $l=4$.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Summation Term\nThe first step is to calculate the sum $S = \\sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l)$ using the provided phase shifts: $\\delta_0=90^\\circ, \\delta_1=67^\\circ, \\delta_2=55^\\circ, \\delta_3=30^\\circ, \\delta_4=13^\\circ$.\n\n*   **l=0:** $(2 \\cdot 0 + 1) \\sin^2(90^\\circ) = 1 \\cdot (1)^2 = 1.0$\n*   **l=1:** $(2 \\cdot 1 + 1) \\sin^2(67^\\circ) = 3 \\cdot (0.9205...)^2 \\approx 2.5420$\n*   **l=2:** $(2 \\cdot 2 + 1) \\sin^2(55^\\circ) = 5 \\cdot (0.8191...)^2 \\approx 3.3551$\n*   **l=3:** $(2 \\cdot 3 + 1) \\sin^2(30^\\circ) = 7 \\cdot (0.5)^2 = 1.75$\n*   **l=4:** $(2 \\cdot 4 + 1) \\sin^2(13^\\circ) = 9 \\cdot (0.2250...)^2 \\approx 0.4554$\n\nSumming these values gives:\n$S \\approx 1.0 + 2.5420 + 3.3551 + 1.75 + 0.4554 = 9.1025$\nThis calculation is consistent across all candidate answers.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Wave Number (k) - The Critical Step\nThis is the most important part of the analysis, as the result depends entirely on the method used to calculate the electron's momentum and wave number.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Relativistic vs. Non-Relativistic Calculation.**\n    The electron's kinetic energy is given as $T = 50 \\text{ MeV}$. The rest mass energy of an electron is $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV}$. Since the kinetic energy is almost 100 times the rest mass energy ($T \\gg m_e c^2$), the electron is highly relativistic. Therefore, the physically correct method is to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\n*   **Method A: Relativistic Calculation (Physically Correct)**\n    The total energy is $E = T + m_e c^2 = 50.511 \\text{ MeV}$. The momentum is found from $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$, which gives $pc \\approx 50.51 \\text{ MeV}$. The wave number is $k = \\frac{pc}{\\hbar c}$. Using $\\hbar c \\approx 197.3 \\text{ MeV fm}$, we get $k \\approx 0.256 \\text{ fm}^{-1}$. This leads to a final answer of $\\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{9.1025}{0.256} \\approx 35.6 \\text{ fm}$, which does not match any of the options.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"Intended Answer\" Dilemma.**\n    In multiple-choice questions, if the physically correct method does not yield a valid answer, it is highly likely that a simplified (though physically inaccurate) method was intended.\n\n*   **Method B: Non-Relativistic Calculation (Physically Incorrect, but likely intended)**\n    The non-relativistic formula for kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m_e}$. We can find the momentum term $pc$ using $(pc)^2 = 2(m_e c^2)T$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot (0.511 \\text{ MeV}) \\cdot (50 \\text{ MeV})} = \\sqrt{51.1} \\approx 7.148 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    The wave number is $k = \\frac{pc}{\\hbar c} \\approx \\frac{7.148 \\text{ MeV}}{197.3 \\text{ MeV fm}} \\approx 0.03623 \\text{ fm}^{-1}$.\n\n### 4. Final Calculation and Decision\nUsing the wave number from the non-relativistic calculation (Method B):\n$$ \\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{S}{k} \\approx \\frac{9.1025}{0.03623 \\text{ fm}^{-1}} \\approx 251.271 \\text{ fm} $$\nThis calculated value is a perfect match for option A. The fact that the physically incorrect method leads to an exact answer, while the correct method does not, is a strong indication that the non-relativistic calculation was the intended solution path for this problem.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Identify the Governing Formula\nThe first step is to identify the correct physical formula. The problem asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the forward direction (along the incident beam, where the scattering angle $\\theta = 0$). All candidate answers correctly identify the formula derived from the partial wave expansion, which is a statement of the Optical Theorem:\n$$ \\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} (2l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l) $$\nwhere:\n*   $k$ is the wave number of the incident electron.\n*   $\\delta_l$ are the phase shifts for each partial wave.\nThe problem specifies that we should sum from $l=0$ to $l=4$ and ignore the rest.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Summation Term\nThe second step is to calculate the sum $S = \\sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l)$ using the given phase shifts: $\\delta_0=90^\\circ, \\delta_1=67^\\circ, \\delta_2=55^\\circ, \\delta_3=30^\\circ, \\delta_4=13^\\circ$. This calculation is straightforward and all candidate answers arrive at the same result.\n\n*   **l=0:** $(2 \\cdot 0 + 1) \\sin^2(90^\\circ) = 1 \\cdot (1)^2 = 1.0$\n*   **l=1:** $(2 \\cdot 1 + 1) \\sin^2(67^\\circ) = 3 \\cdot (0.9205)^2 \\approx 2.542$\n*   **l=2:** $(2 \\cdot 2 + 1) \\sin^2(55^\\circ) = 5 \\cdot (0.8192)^2 \\approx 3.355$\n*   **l=3:** $(2 \\cdot 3 + 1) \\sin^2(30^\\circ) = 7 \\cdot (0.5)^2 = 1.75$\n*   **l=4:** $(2 \\cdot 4 + 1) \\sin^2(13^\\circ) = 9 \\cdot (0.2250)^2 \\approx 0.455$\n\nSumming these values gives:\n$S \\approx 1.0 + 2.542 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.455 = 9.102$\nUsing higher precision, the sum is approximately **9.1025**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Wave Number (k) - The Critical Step\nThis is the most important part of the analysis and requires careful consideration.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Relativistic vs. Non-relativistic Calculation.** The electron's kinetic energy is given as $T = 50 \\text{ MeV}$. The rest mass energy of an electron is $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV}$. Since the kinetic energy is almost 100 times the rest mass energy ($T \\gg m_e c^2$), the electron is highly relativistic. The physically correct method is to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$. This calculation, performed correctly by the candidate answers, yields a wave number $k \\approx 0.256 \\text{ fm}^{-1}$ and a final result of $\\text{Im}[f(0)] \\approx 35.6 \\text{ fm}$. This does not match any of the provided options.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"Intended Solution\" Dilemma.** In multiple-choice questions, if the physically correct method does not lead to an answer, it is highly probable that a simplified (even if physically inaccurate) method was intended. All candidate answers correctly deduce this and test the non-relativistic formula for kinetic energy: $T = p^2 / (2m_e)$.\n\nUsing the non-relativistic approach:\n*   $(pc)^2 = 2(m_e c^2)T = 2 \\cdot (0.511 \\text{ MeV}) \\cdot (50 \\text{ MeV}) = 51.1 \\text{ (MeV)}^2$\n*   $pc = \\sqrt{51.1} \\approx 7.148 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   $k = \\frac{pc}{\\hbar c} \\approx \\frac{7.148 \\text{ MeV}}{197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}} \\approx 0.036226 \\text{ fm}^{-1}$\n\n### 4. Final Calculation and Decision\nUsing the summation term and the non-relativistic wave number:\n$$ \\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{S}{k} \\approx \\frac{9.1025}{0.036226 \\text{ fm}^{-1}} \\approx 251.271 \\text{ fm} $$\nThis calculated value is a perfect match for option A.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis consistently shows that although the electron is highly relativistic, the problem is designed to be solved using the non-relativistic formula for kinetic energy. This is the only way to arrive at one of the given options. The calculation yields a value of 251.271 fm, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by first identifying the correct physical formula and then performing the necessary calculations. The process will be as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Formula**: The problem asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the forward direction, $\\text{Im}[f(0)]$. The correct formula from partial wave analysis is $\\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} (2l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l)$.\n2.  **Calculate the Summation Term**: I will calculate the sum $S = \\sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l)$ using the five given phase shifts.\n3.  **Calculate the Wave Number (k)**: This is the most critical step. The electron's kinetic energy (50 MeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy (~0.511 MeV), meaning it is highly relativistic.

The problem states to sum from $l=0$ to $l=4$.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Summation Term\nThe first step is to compute the sum $S = \\sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l)$ using the given phase shifts: $\\delta_0=90^\\circ, \\delta_1=67^\\circ, \\delta_2=55^\\circ, \\delta_3=30^\\circ, \\delta_4=13^\\circ$.\n\n*   **l=0:** $(2 \\cdot 0 + 1) \\sin^2(90^\\circ) = 1 \\cdot (1)^2 = 1.0$\n*   **l=1:** $(2 \\cdot 1 + 1) \\sin^2(67^\\circ) = 3 \\cdot (0.9205...)^2 \\approx 2.5420$\n*   **l=2:** $(2 \\cdot 2 + 1) \\sin^2(55^\\circ) = 5 \\cdot (0.8191...)^2 \\approx 3.3551$\n*   **l=3:** $(2 \\cdot 3 + 1) \\sin^2(30^\\circ) = 7 \\cdot (0.5)^2 = 1.75$\n*   **l=4:** $(2 \\cdot 4 + 1) \\sin^2(13^\\circ) = 9 \\cdot (0.2249...)^2 \\approx 0.4554$\n\nSumming these values gives:\n$S \\approx 1.0 + 2.5420 + 3.3551 + 1.75 + 0.4554 = 9.1025$\n\n### 3.

Calculate the Summation Term\nThis step is to calculate the sum $S = \\sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l)$ using the given phase shifts: $\\delta_0=90^\\circ, \\delta_1=67^\\circ, \\delta_2=55^\\circ, \\delta_3=30^\\circ, \\delta_4=13^\\circ$.\n\n*   **l=0:** $(2 \\cdot 0 + 1) \\sin^2(90^\\circ) = 1 \\cdot (1)^2 = 1.0$\n*   **l=1:** $(2 \\cdot 1 + 1) \\sin^2(67^\\circ) = 3 \\cdot (0.9205...)^2 \\approx 2.5420$\n*   **l=2:** $(2 \\cdot 2 + 1) \\sin^2(55^\\circ) = 5 \\cdot (0.8191...)^2 \\approx 3.3551$\n*   **l=3:** $(2 \\cdot 3 + 1) \\sin^2(30^\\circ) = 7 \\cdot (0.5)^2 = 1.75$\n*   **l=4:** $(2 \\cdot 4 + 1) \\sin^2(13^\\circ) = 9 \\cdot (0.2250...)^2 \\approx 0.4554$\n\nSumming these values gives:\n$S \\approx 1.0 + 2.5420 + 3.3551 + 1.75 + 0.4554 = 9.1025$\n\n### 3. Calculate the Wave Number (k)\nThis is the most critical step and requires careful analysis. The wave number $k$ is derived from the electron's momentum, which in turn depends on its kinetic energy, $T = 50 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Relativistic vs. Non-relativistic Calculation.** The rest mass energy of an electron is $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV}$. Since the given kinetic energy ($T = 50 \\text{ MeV}$) is almost 100 times the rest mass energy, the electron is highly relativistic. Therefore, the physically correct method is to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\n*   **Physically Correct (Relativistic) Approach:**\n    The total energy is $E = T + m_e c^2 = 50.511 \\text{ MeV}$. The momentum is found from $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$, which gives $pc \\approx 50.508 \\text{ MeV}$. The wave number is $k = \\frac{pc}{\\hbar c}$. Using $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}$, we get $k \\approx 0.256 \\text{ fm}^{-1}$. This leads to a final answer of $\\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{9.1025}{0.256} \\approx 35.6 \\text{ fm}$, which does not match any of the options.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"Intended Answer\" Dilemma.** In multiple-choice physics problems, if the physically correct method does not yield a match, it is common that a simplified (though physically inaccurate) model was intended. We must test this alternative.\n\n*   **Simplified (Non-Relativistic) Approach:**\n    The momentum is found from the non-relativistic formula $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m_e}$, which gives $(pc)^2 = 2(m_e c^2)T$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot (0.511 \\text{ MeV}) \\cdot (50 \\text{ MeV})} = \\sqrt{51.1} \\approx 7.148 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    The wave number is $k = \\frac{pc}{\\hbar c} \\approx \\frac{7.148 \\text{ MeV}}{197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}} \\approx 0.036226 \\text{ fm}^{-1}$.\n\n### 4. Final Calculation and Decision\nUsing the wave number from the non-relativistic calculation:\n$$ \\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{S}{k} \\approx \\frac{9.1025}{0.036226 \\text{ fm}^{-1}} \\approx 251.271 \\text{ fm} $$\nThis result is a perfect match for option A.

Calculate the Summation Term\nThe next step is to calculate the sum $S = \\sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l)$ using the given phase shifts: $\\delta_0=90^\\circ, \\delta_1=67^\\circ, \\delta_2=55^\\circ, \\delta_3=30^\\circ, \\delta_4=13^\\circ$.\n\n*   **l=0:** $(2 \\cdot 0 + 1) \\sin^2(90^\\circ) = 1 \\cdot (1)^2 = 1.0$\n*   **l=1:** $(2 \\cdot 1 + 1) \\sin^2(67^\\circ) = 3 \\cdot (0.9205)^2 \\approx 2.5420$\n*   **l=2:** $(2 \\cdot 2 + 1) \\sin^2(55^\\circ) = 5 \\cdot (0.8192)^2 \\approx 3.3551$\n*   **l=3:** $(2 \\cdot 3 + 1) \\sin^2(30^\\circ) = 7 \\cdot (0.5)^2 = 1.75$\n*   **l=4:** $(2 \\cdot 4 + 1) \\sin^2(13^\\circ) = 9 \\cdot (0.2250)^2 \\approx 0.4555$\n\nSumming these values gives:\n$S \\approx 1.0 + 2.5420 + 3.3551 + 1.75 + 0.4555 = 9.1026$\n\nThis calculation is straightforward and consistently performed across the candidate answers.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Wave Number (k) - The Critical Step\nThis is the most important part of the analysis and contains a significant trap.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Relativistic vs. Non-relativistic Calculation.**\n    The electron's kinetic energy is given as $T = 50 \\text{ MeV}$. The rest mass energy of an electron is $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV}$. Since the kinetic energy is almost 100 times the rest mass energy ($T \\gg m_e c^2$), the electron is highly relativistic. The physically correct approach is to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\n*   **Path A: Relativistic Calculation (Physically Correct)**\n    The total energy is $E = T + m_e c^2 = 50 + 0.511 = 50.511 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    The momentum is found from the relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2} \\approx 50.51 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    The wave number is $k = \\frac{pc}{\\hbar c}$. Using the standard value $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}$:\n    $k \\approx \\frac{50.51 \\text{ MeV}}{197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}} \\approx 0.256 \\text{ fm}^{-1}$.\n    This would give $\\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{S}{k} \\approx \\frac{9.1026}{0.256} \\approx 35.6 \\text{ fm}$. This result does not match any of the options.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"Intended Solution\" Heuristic.**\n    In the context of a multiple-choice question, if the physically correct method does not yield a matching answer, it is highly probable that the question designer intended for a simplified (even if physically incorrect) method to be used. Let's test the non-relativistic formula.\n\n*   **Path B: Non-relativistic Calculation (Physically Incorrect, but Intended)**\n    The non-relativistic kinetic energy formula is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m_e}$.\n    We can find the momentum term $pc$ using $(pc)^2 = 2(m_e c^2)T$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot (0.511 \\text{ MeV}) \\cdot (50 \\text{ MeV})} = \\sqrt{51.1} \\approx 7.148 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    The wave number is $k = \\frac{pc}{\\hbar c}$:\n    $k \\approx \\frac{7.148 \\text{ MeV}}{197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}} \\approx 0.036226 \\text{ fm}^{-1}$.\n\n### 4. Final Calculation and Conclusion\nUsing the wave number from the non-relativistic calculation (Path B):\n$$ \\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{S}{k} \\approx \\frac{9.1026}{0.036226 \\text{ fm}^{-1}} \\approx 251.271 \\text{ fm} $$\nThis result is a perfect match for option D. The fact that the physically incorrect method yields a perfect match, while the physically correct one does not, is a strong indication that the non-relativistic calculation was the intended solution path for this problem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Identify the Governing Formula\nThe first step is to identify the correct physical formula. The question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the forward direction (where the scattering angle $\\theta = 0$). All candidate answers correctly identify the formula from the partial wave expansion, which is a direct result of the Optical Theorem:\n$$ \\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} (2l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l) $$\nwhere:\n*   $k$ is the wave number of the incident electron.\n*   $\\delta_l$ are the phase shifts for each partial wave.\nThe problem specifies to sum from $l=0$ to $l=4$.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Summation Term\nThe second step is to calculate the sum $S = \\sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l)$ using the given phase shifts: $\\delta_0=90^\\circ, \\delta_1=67^\\circ, \\delta_2=55^\\circ, \\delta_3=30^\\circ, \\delta_4=13^\\circ$. This calculation is performed consistently across all candidate answers.\n\n*   **l=0:** $(2 \\cdot 0 + 1) \\sin^2(90^\\circ) = 1 \\cdot (1)^2 = 1.0$\n*   **l=1:** $(2 \\cdot 1 + 1) \\sin^2(67^\\circ) = 3 \\cdot (0.9205...)^2 \\approx 2.542$\n*   **l=2:** $(2 \\cdot 2 + 1) \\sin^2(55^\\circ) = 5 \\cdot (0.8191...)^2 \\approx 3.355$\n*   **l=3:** $(2 \\cdot 3 + 1) \\sin^2(30^\\circ) = 7 \\cdot (0.5)^2 = 1.75$\n*   **l=4:** $(2 \\cdot 4 + 1) \\sin^2(13^\\circ) = 9 \\cdot (0.2250...)^2 \\approx 0.455$\n\nSumming these values gives:\n$S \\approx 1.0 + 2.542 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.455 = 9.102$\nUsing higher precision, the sum is approximately **9.1025**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Wave Number (k) - The Critical Step\nThis is the most important part of the analysis and requires careful consideration. The calculation of the wave number $k$ depends on the formula used for the electron's momentum, given its kinetic energy $T = 50 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Relativistic vs. Non-relativistic Calculation.** The electron's rest mass energy is $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV}$. Since the kinetic energy ($T = 50 \\text{ MeV}$) is nearly 100 times the rest mass energy, the electron is highly relativistic. Therefore, the physically correct method is to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\n*   **Method A: Relativistic Calculation (Physically Correct)**\n    The total energy is $E = T + m_e c^2 = 50.511 \\text{ MeV}$. The momentum is found from $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$, which gives $pc \\approx 50.51 \\text{ MeV}$. The wave number is $k = \\frac{pc}{\\hbar c}$. Using the standard value $\\hbar c \\approx 197.3 \\text{ MeV fm}$, we get $k \\approx 0.256 \\text{ fm}^{-1}$. This leads to a final answer of $\\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{S}{k} \\approx \\frac{9.1025}{0.256} \\approx 35.6 \\text{ fm}$. As all candidate answers correctly note, this result does not match any of the options.\n\n*   **Method B: Non-relativistic Calculation (Physically Incorrect, but Intended)**\n    In the context of a multiple-choice question, if the physically correct method fails to produce a matching answer, it is highly probable that a simplified (even if incorrect) method was intended. Let's use the non-relativistic formula for kinetic energy, $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m_e}$. This gives $(pc)^2 = 2(m_e c^2)T = 2(0.511)(50) = 51.1 \\text{ (MeV)}^2$, so $pc \\approx 7.148 \\text{ MeV}$. The wave number is $k = \\frac{pc}{\\hbar c} \\approx \\frac{7.148}{197.3} \\approx 0.03623 \\text{ fm}^{-1}$.\n\n### 4. Final Calculation and Decision\nUsing the wave number from the non-relativistic calculation (Method B):\n$$ \\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{S}{k} \\approx \\frac{9.1025}{0.03623 \\text{ fm}^{-1}} \\approx 251.27 \\text{ fm} $$\nThis calculated value is an excellent match for option **C) 251.271 fm**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe consensus among all candidate answers is that although the electron is highly relativistic, the problem is constructed in a way that requires the use of the non-relativistic formula for the wave number to arrive at one of the given options. The calculation using this intended method yields a value of approximately 251.271 fm, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points identified from the candidate answers.\n\n### 1.

Identify the Governing Formula\nThe question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the forward direction (along the incident beam, where the scattering angle $\\theta=0$). The correct formula, derived from the partial wave expansion and the Optical Theorem, is:\n$$ \\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} (2l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l) $$\nwhere $k$ is the wave number of the incident electron and $\\delta_l$ are the phase shifts. The problem specifies to sum from $l=0$ to $l=4$.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Summation Term\nThe first step is to calculate the sum $S = \\sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l)$ using the provided phase shifts: $\\delta_0=90^\\circ, \\delta_1=67^\\circ, \\delta_2=55^\\circ, \\delta_3=30^\\circ, \\delta_4=13^\\circ$.\n\n*   **l=0:** $(2 \\cdot 0 + 1) \\sin^2(90^\\circ) = 1 \\cdot (1)^2 = 1.0$\n*   **l=1:** $(2 \\cdot 1 + 1) \\sin^2(67^\\circ) = 3 \\cdot (0.9205...)^2 \\approx 2.5420$\n*   **l=2:** $(2 \\cdot 2 + 1) \\sin^2(55^\\circ) = 5 \\cdot (0.8191...)^2 \\approx 3.3551$\n*   **l=3:** $(2 \\cdot 3 + 1) \\sin^2(30^\\circ) = 7 \\cdot (0.5)^2 = 1.75$\n*   **l=4:** $(2 \\cdot 4 + 1) \\sin^2(13^\\circ) = 9 \\cdot (0.2250...)^2 \\approx 0.4554$\n\nSumming these values gives:\n$S \\approx 1.0 + 2.5420 + 3.3551 + 1.75 + 0.4554 = 9.1025$\nThis calculation is consistent across all candidate answers.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Wave Number (k) - The Critical Step\nThis is the most important part of the analysis, as the result depends entirely on the method used to calculate the electron's momentum and wave number.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Relativistic vs. Non-Relativistic Calculation.**\n    The electron's kinetic energy is given as $T = 50 \\text{ MeV}$. The rest mass energy of an electron is $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV}$. Since the kinetic energy is almost 100 times the rest mass energy ($T \\gg m_e c^2$), the electron is highly relativistic. Therefore, the physically correct method is to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\n*   **Method A: Relativistic Calculation (Physically Correct)**\n    The total energy is $E = T + m_e c^2 = 50.511 \\text{ MeV}$. The momentum is found from $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$, which gives $pc \\approx 50.51 \\text{ MeV}$. The wave number is $k = \\frac{pc}{\\hbar c}$. Using $\\hbar c \\approx 197.3 \\text{ MeV fm}$, we get $k \\approx 0.256 \\text{ fm}^{-1}$. This leads to a final answer of $\\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{9.1025}{0.256} \\approx 35.6 \\text{ fm}$, which does not match any of the options.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"Intended Answer\" Dilemma.**\n    In multiple-choice questions, if the physically correct method does not yield a valid answer, it is highly likely that a simplified (though physically inaccurate) method was intended.\n\n*   **Method B: Non-Relativistic Calculation (Physically Incorrect, but likely intended)**\n    The non-relativistic formula for kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m_e}$. We can find the momentum term $pc$ using $(pc)^2 = 2(m_e c^2)T$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot (0.511 \\text{ MeV}) \\cdot (50 \\text{ MeV})} = \\sqrt{51.1} \\approx 7.148 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    The wave number is $k = \\frac{pc}{\\hbar c} \\approx \\frac{7.148 \\text{ MeV}}{197.3 \\text{ MeV fm}} \\approx 0.03623 \\text{ fm}^{-1}$.\n\n### 4. Final Calculation and Decision\nUsing the wave number from the non-relativistic calculation (Method B):\n$$ \\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{S}{k} \\approx \\frac{9.1025}{0.03623 \\text{ fm}^{-1}} \\approx 251.271 \\text{ fm} $$\nThis calculated value is a perfect match for option A. The fact that the physically incorrect method leads to an exact answer, while the correct method does not, is a strong indication that the non-relativistic calculation was the intended solution path for this problem.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Identify the Governing Formula\nThe first step is to identify the correct physical formula. The problem asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the forward direction (along the incident beam, where the scattering angle $\\theta = 0$). All candidate answers correctly identify the formula derived from the partial wave expansion, which is a statement of the Optical Theorem:\n$$ \\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} (2l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l) $$\nwhere:\n*   $k$ is the wave number of the incident electron.\n*   $\\delta_l$ are the phase shifts for each partial wave.\nThe problem specifies that we should sum from $l=0$ to $l=4$ and ignore the rest.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Summation Term\nThe second step is to calculate the sum $S = \\sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l)$ using the given phase shifts: $\\delta_0=90^\\circ, \\delta_1=67^\\circ, \\delta_2=55^\\circ, \\delta_3=30^\\circ, \\delta_4=13^\\circ$. This calculation is straightforward and all candidate answers arrive at the same result.\n\n*   **l=0:** $(2 \\cdot 0 + 1) \\sin^2(90^\\circ) = 1 \\cdot (1)^2 = 1.0$\n*   **l=1:** $(2 \\cdot 1 + 1) \\sin^2(67^\\circ) = 3 \\cdot (0.9205)^2 \\approx 2.542$\n*   **l=2:** $(2 \\cdot 2 + 1) \\sin^2(55^\\circ) = 5 \\cdot (0.8192)^2 \\approx 3.355$\n*   **l=3:** $(2 \\cdot 3 + 1) \\sin^2(30^\\circ) = 7 \\cdot (0.5)^2 = 1.75$\n*   **l=4:** $(2 \\cdot 4 + 1) \\sin^2(13^\\circ) = 9 \\cdot (0.2250)^2 \\approx 0.455$\n\nSumming these values gives:\n$S \\approx 1.0 + 2.542 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.455 = 9.102$\nUsing higher precision, the sum is approximately **9.1025**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Wave Number (k) - The Critical Step\nThis is the most important part of the analysis and requires careful consideration.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Relativistic vs. Non-relativistic Calculation.** The electron's kinetic energy is given as $T = 50 \\text{ MeV}$. The rest mass energy of an electron is $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV}$. Since the kinetic energy is almost 100 times the rest mass energy ($T \\gg m_e c^2$), the electron is highly relativistic. The physically correct method is to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$. This calculation, performed correctly by the candidate answers, yields a wave number $k \\approx 0.256 \\text{ fm}^{-1}$ and a final result of $\\text{Im}[f(0)] \\approx 35.6 \\text{ fm}$. This does not match any of the provided options.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"Intended Solution\" Dilemma.** In multiple-choice questions, if the physically correct method does not lead to an answer, it is highly probable that a simplified (even if physically inaccurate) method was intended. All candidate answers correctly deduce this and test the non-relativistic formula for kinetic energy: $T = p^2 / (2m_e)$.\n\nUsing the non-relativistic approach:\n*   $(pc)^2 = 2(m_e c^2)T = 2 \\cdot (0.511 \\text{ MeV}) \\cdot (50 \\text{ MeV}) = 51.1 \\text{ (MeV)}^2$\n*   $pc = \\sqrt{51.1} \\approx 7.148 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   $k = \\frac{pc}{\\hbar c} \\approx \\frac{7.148 \\text{ MeV}}{197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}} \\approx 0.036226 \\text{ fm}^{-1}$\n\n### 4. Final Calculation and Decision\nUsing the summation term and the non-relativistic wave number:\n$$ \\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{S}{k} \\approx \\frac{9.1025}{0.036226 \\text{ fm}^{-1}} \\approx 251.271 \\text{ fm} $$\nThis calculated value is a perfect match for option A.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis consistently shows that although the electron is highly relativistic, the problem is designed to be solved using the non-relativistic formula for kinetic energy. This is the only way to arrive at one of the given options. The calculation yields a value of 251.271 fm, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by first identifying the correct physical formula and then performing the necessary calculations. The process will be as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Formula**: The problem asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the forward direction, $\\text{Im}[f(0)]$. The correct formula from partial wave analysis is $\\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} (2l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l)$.\n2.  **Calculate the Summation Term**: I will calculate the sum $S = \\sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l)$ using the five given phase shifts.\n3.  **Calculate the Wave Number (k)**: This is the most critical step. The electron's kinetic energy (50 MeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy (~0.511 MeV), meaning it is highly relativistic. I will analyze both the physically correct relativistic calculation and the simplified non-relativistic calculation.\n4.  **Compare and Conclude**: I will show that the non-relativistic calculation, while physically inaccurate for this energy level, is the only method that yields one of the multiple-choice answers.

Identify the Governing Formula**\n\nThe question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. This corresponds to the forward scattering angle, $\\theta = 0$. The formula for this quantity, derived from the partial wave expansion and a direct result of the Optical Theorem, is:\n\n$$ \\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} (2l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l) $$\n\nwhere:\n*   $k$ is the wave number of the incident electron.\n*   $\\delta_l$ are the phase shifts for each partial wave with angular momentum quantum number $l$.\n*   The problem specifies to sum from $l=0$ to $l=4$ and ignore the rest.\n\n**2. Calculate the Summation Term**\n\nThe first step is to calculate the sum $S = \\sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l)$ using the provided phase shifts: $\\delta_0=90^\\circ, \\delta_1=67^\\circ, \\delta_2=55^\\circ, \\delta_3=30^\\circ, \\delta_4=13^\\circ$.\n\n*   **l=0:** $(2 \\cdot 0 + 1) \\sin^2(90^\\circ) = 1 \\cdot (1)^2 = 1.0$\n*   **l=1:** $(2 \\cdot 1 + 1) \\sin^2(67^\\circ) = 3 \\cdot (0.9205...)^2 \\approx 2.5420$\n*   **l=2:** $(2 \\cdot 2 + 1) \\sin^2(55^\\circ) = 5 \\cdot (0.8191...)^2 \\approx 3.3551$\n*   **l=3:** $(2 \\cdot 3 + 1) \\sin^2(30^\\circ) = 7 \\cdot (0.5)^2 = 1.75$\n*   **l=4:** $(2 \\cdot 4 + 1) \\sin^2(13^\\circ) = 9 \\cdot (0.2250...)^2 \\approx 0.4554$\n\nSumming these values gives:\n$S \\approx 1.0 + 2.5420 + 3.3551 + 1.75 + 0.4554 = 9.1025$\n\n**3. Calculate the Wave Number (k) - The Critical Step**\n\nThis step requires careful consideration. The wave number $k$ is related to momentum $p$ by $k = p/\\hbar$. We must find the momentum from the given kinetic energy, $T = 50 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Relativistic vs. Non-Relativistic Calculation.**\n    The rest mass energy of an electron is $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV}$. Since the kinetic energy ($T = 50 \\text{ MeV}$) is almost 100 times the rest mass energy, the electron is highly relativistic. Therefore, the physically correct method is to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$, where $E = T + m_e c^2$.\n\n*   **Method A: Relativistic Calculation (Physically Correct)**\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{(T + m_e c^2)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2} \\approx 50.51 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $k = \\frac{pc}{\\hbar c} \\approx \\frac{50.51 \\text{ MeV}}{197.3 \\text{ MeV fm}} \\approx 0.256 \\text{ fm}^{-1}$\n    *   This would give $\\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{9.1025}{0.256} \\approx 35.6 \\text{ fm}$, which does not match any of the options.\n\n*   **Method B: Non-Relativistic Calculation (Physically Incorrect, but Intended)**\n    In the context of textbook or exam problems, it is common for the intended solution to use a simplified formula if it leads to one of the answers. Let's test the non-relativistic formula: $T = p^2 / (2m_e)$.\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{2(m_e c^2)T} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot (0.511 \\text{ MeV}) \\cdot (50 \\text{ MeV})} = \\sqrt{51.1} \\approx 7.148 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $k = \\frac{pc}{\\hbar c} \\approx \\frac{7.148 \\text{ MeV}}{197.3 \\text{ MeV fm}} \\approx 0.03623 \\text{ fm}^{-1}$\n\n**4.
