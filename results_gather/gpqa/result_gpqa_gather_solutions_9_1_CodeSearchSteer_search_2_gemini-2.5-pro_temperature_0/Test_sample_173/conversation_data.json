Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments and the Q-value**\n\nFirst, let's find the rest-masses of the two fragments, $m_1$ and $m_2$. We are given:\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   The more massive fragment ($m_1$) is twice as massive as the other ($m_2$): $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   The sum of the fragments' rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$.\n\nSubstitute the first relation into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M$\n$3m_2 = 0.99 M$\n$m_2 = 0.33 M$\n\nNow, find $m_1$:\n$m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33 M) = 0.66 M$\n\nNext, let's find their rest-mass energies:\n*   $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe Q-value of the fission is the energy released, which is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments ($T_{total} = T_1 + T_2$). It's the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n$Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV})$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**2. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is $T = p^2 / (2m)$, where $p$ is the momentum.\nThe initial nucleus is at rest, so by the law of conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be $p$.\n$p_1 = p_2 = p$\n\nThe kinetic energies are:\n*   $T_{1, class} = p^2 / (2m_1)$\n*   $T_{2, class} = p^2 / (2m_2)$\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n$\\frac{T_{1, class}}{T_{2, class}} = \\frac{p^2 / (2m_1)}{p^2 / (2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33 M}{0.66 M} = \\frac{1}{2}$\nSo, $T_{2, class} = 2 T_{1, class}$.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is the Q-value:\n$T_{1, class} + T_{2, class} = Q$\n$T_{1, class} + 2 T_{1, class} = Q$\n$3 T_{1, class} = Q$\n$T_{1, class} = \\frac{Q}{3} = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV}}{3} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\nSo, the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is $T_{1, class} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy ($E$), momentum ($p$), and rest-mass ($m$) is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. The kinetic energy is $T = E - mc^2$.\nFrom this, we can write $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2$.\n\nSince the momenta are equal ($p_1 = p_2 = p$), we have:\n$(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1m_1c^2 = T_2^2 + 2T_2m_2c^2$\n\nSubstitute $T_2 = Q - T_1$:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1m_1c^2 = (Q - T_1)^2 + 2(Q - T_1)m_2c^2$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1m_1c^2 = (Q^2 - 2QT_1 + T_1^2) + (2Qm_2c^2 - 2T_1m_2c^2)$\n\nThe $T_1^2$ terms on both sides cancel out. Now, we group the terms with $T_1$:\n$2T_1m_1c^2 + 2QT_1 + 2T_1m_2c^2 = Q^2 + 2Qm_2c^2$\n$T_1 (2m_1c^2 + 2m_2c^2 + 2Q) = Q^2 + 2Qm_2c^2$\n$T_1 (2(m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + 2Q) = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n\nNow, solve for $T_1$ (which is the correct relativistic value, $T_{1, rel}$):\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)}{2((m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + Q)}$\n\nPlug in the values we found earlier:\n*   $Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_1c^2 = 198 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_2c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 = 297 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV} (3 \\text{ GeV} + 2 \\times 99 \\text{ GeV})}{2(297 \\text{ GeV} + 3 \\text{ GeV})}$\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 (3 + 198)}{2(300)} \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 \\times 201}{600} \\text{ GeV} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is $T_{1, rel} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**4. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = $T_{1, rel} - T_{1, class}$\nDifference = $1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Define the initial and final states\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   The more massive fragment is `m1`, and the less massive is `m2`.\n    *   `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, calculate their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1c^2 = 0.66 * Mc^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2c^2 = 0.33 * Mc^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released during the fission is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n\n`Q = T1 + T2 = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nFrom the conservation of momentum, the initial momentum is zero, so the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n\nTherefore:\n`p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical`\n`p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n\nThis gives us the relationship:\n`m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n`(0.66 * M) * T1_classical = (0.33 * M) * T2_classical`\n`2 * T1_classical = T2_classical`\n\nWe also know that the total kinetic energy is `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\nSubstituting `T2_classical`:\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1\n\nFor the relativistic case, we use the energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`, where total energy `E = T + mc^2`.\nThis can be rearranged to find the momentum: `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2`.\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c^2`\n\nWe know `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`, so `T2 = 3 - T1`. We also have the rest-mass energies `m1c^2 = 198 GeV` and `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n`T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms cancel out:\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 6. Find the difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert this value to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define Constants and Initial Values:** Set up the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus, `E_M`, in GeV.\n2.  **Calculate Fragment Masses:** Use the given relationships (`m1 = 2*m2` and `m1 + m2 = 0.99*M`) to determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments, `m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`.\n3.  **Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):** The total kinetic energy released, `Q`, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n4.  **Calculate Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical):** In the non-relativistic approximation, the total kinetic energy `Q` is shared between the fragments inversely proportional to their masses. We will calculate the kinetic energy `T1` for the more massive fragment (`m1`).\n5.  **Calculate Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1_relativistic):** Using the principles of energy and momentum conservation in special relativity, we will derive and calculate the correct kinetic energy `T1` for the more massive fragment. The total energy of the first fragment (`E1`) can be found using the formula: `E1 = ( (M*c^2)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2 ) / (2 * M*c^2)`. The kinetic energy is then `T1 = E1 - m1*c^2`.\n6.  **Find the Difference:** Calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values of `T1`.\n7.  **Convert to MeV and Conclude:** Convert the result from GeV to MeV and select the corresponding option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define Initial Values\n# Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus in GeV\nE_M_GeV = 300.0\n\n# Step 2: Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies\n# We have two equations:\n# 1) m1c2 + m2c2 = 0.99 * E_M_GeV\n# 2) m1c2 = 2 * m2c2\n# Substitute (2) into (1):\n# 2 * m2c2 + m2c2 = 0.99 * E_M_GeV\n# 3 * m2c2 = 0.99 * E_M_GeV\nm2c2_GeV = (0.99 * E_M_GeV) / 3.0\nm1c2_GeV = 2.0 * m2c2_GeV\n\n# Step 3: Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\n# Q is the energy released, which becomes the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\nQ_GeV = E_M_GeV - (m1c2_GeV + m2c2_GeV)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical)\n# In classical mechanics, momentum p is conserved (p1=p2=p), and T = p^2/(2m).\n# So, T1/T2 = m2/m1.\n# Also, T1 + T2 = Q.\n# This leads to T1 = Q * m2 / (m1 + m2).\n# In terms of rest-mass energies: T1 = Q * m2c2 / (m1c2 + m2c2)\nT1_classical_GeV = Q_GeV * m2c2_GeV / (m1c2_GeV + m2c2_GeV)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1_relativistic)\n# From relativistic energy-momentum conservation for a two-body decay from rest:\n# The total energy of the first fragment is E1 = (E_M^2 + (m1c2)^2 - (m2c2)^2) / (2 * E_M)\nE1_GeV = (E_M_GeV**2 + m1c2_GeV**2 - m2c2_GeV**2) / (2 * E_M_GeV)\n# The kinetic energy is T1 = E1 - m1c2\nT1_relativistic_GeV = E1_GeV - m1c2_GeV\n\n# Step 6: Find the Difference\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic_GeV - T1_classical_GeV\n\n# Step 7: Convert to MeV and Print the Result\n# 1 GeV = 1000 MeV\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Initial rest-mass energy (M*c^2): {E_M_GeV} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (m1*c^2): {m1c2_GeV:.2f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (m2*c^2): {m2c2_GeV:.2f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Total kinetic energy released (Q): {Q_GeV:.2f} GeV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical_GeV:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic_GeV:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"The difference between the relativistic and classical T1 is {difference_MeV:.2f} MeV.\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to option B.\")\n\n<<<B>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 54\n    <<<B>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments, let's call their rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's say $m_1$ is the more massive fragment, so $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  $m_1 = 2m_2$\n2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n$3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\n\nNow find $m_1$:\n$m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies using the initial rest-mass energy ($Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$):\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment ($m_1$): $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times Mc^2 = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment ($m_2$): $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times Mc^2 = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n$Q = (\\text{Initial rest energy}) - (\\text{Final rest energy})$\n$Q = Mc^2 - (m_1 + m_2)c^2$\n$Q = Mc^2 - (0.99M)c^2 = 0.01Mc^2$\n\nUsing the given value $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$:\n$Q = 0.01 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis Q-value is the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments:\n$T_{total} = T_1 + T_2 = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the fragments must be zero. This means they fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let $p_{cl}$ be the magnitude of the classical momentum for each fragment.\n    $p_1 = p_2 = p_{cl}$\n*   **Kinetic Energy:** In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = p^2 / (2m)$.\n    *   $T_{1,cl} = p_{cl}^2 / (2m_1)$\n    *   $T_{2,cl} = p_{cl}^2 / (2m_2)$\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:**\n    $\\frac{T_{1,cl}}{T_{2,cl}} = \\frac{p_{cl}^2 / (2m_1)}{p_{cl}^2 / (2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{m_2}{2m_2} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n    So, $T_{2,cl} = 2T_{1,cl}$.\n*   **Solving for T1:** We know the total kinetic energy is $Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    $T_{1,cl} + T_{2,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $T_{1,cl} + 2T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $3T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $T_{1,cl} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite: $p_1 = p_2 = p_{rel}$.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, where $E$ is the total energy ($E = T + mc^2$).\n    *   $E_1^2 = (p_{rel}c)^2 + (m_1c^2)^2$\n    *   $E_2^2 = (p_{rel}c)^2 + (m_2c^2)^2$\n*   **Solving for Energies:** From the relations above, we can equate the $(p_{rel}c)^2$ terms:\n    $E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n    $E_1^2 - E_2^2 = (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n    $(E_1 - E_2)(E_1 + E_2) = (m_1^2 - m_2^2)c^4$\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy is conserved. The initial total energy was $Mc^2$. The final total energy is $E_1 + E_2$.\n    $E_1 + E_2 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   **Finding E1:** Substitute the known values into the momentum equation:\n    $(E_1 - E_2)(300 \\text{ GeV}) = (198 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (99 \\text{ GeV})^2$\n    $(E_1 - E_2)(300) = 39204 - 9801 = 29403$\n    $E_1 - E_2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for $E_1$ and $E_2$:\n    1.  $E_1 + E_2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n    2.  $E_1 - E_2 = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$\n    Add the two equations to solve for $E_1$:\n    $2E_1 = 300 + 98.01 = 398.01 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $E_1 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   **Finding T1:** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy.\n    $T_{1,rel} = E_1 - m_1c^2$\n    $T_{1,rel} = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical value.\nDifference = $T_{1,rel} - T_{1,cl}$\nDifference = $1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1.000 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nFinally, convert the answer to MeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$):\nDifference = $0.005 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum is `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Mass relationship: `m1 = 2 * m2`. This also means their rest-mass energies are related by `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-mass energies is `E_final_rest = (m1 + m2)c^2 = 0.99 * Mc^2`.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2` and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nFirst, let's find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments.\n*   `E_final_rest = 0.99 * (300 GeV) = 297 GeV`.\n*   We have a system of two equations:\n    1.  `m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2`\n*   Substitute (2) into (1): `(2 * m2c^2) + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n*   `3 * m2c^2 = 297 GeV` => `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n*   From this, `m1c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\nThe energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = E_initial - E_final_rest = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. This means the fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes.\n*   `p1 = p2`.\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   Since `p1 = p2`, we have `p1^2 = p2^2`.\n*   `2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`.\n*   `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`.\n*   Substituting `m1 = 2*m2`: `(2*m2) * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical` => `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Now use the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 using Correct (Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (mc²) is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. The total energy is also `E = T + mc^2`.\n*   Substituting for E: `(T + mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\n*   Expanding and simplifying gives the relation for momentum: `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n*   From conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`.\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 2*m1c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2c^2)`.\n*   Substitute the known values: `m1c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`.\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2 * 99)`.\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`.\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2`.\n*   The `T1^2` terms cancel out.\n*   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`.\n*   `600*T1 = 603`.\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **6.

Define the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of rest mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum: `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies `T₁` and `T₂` and momenta `p₁` and `p₂`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest Masses of the Fragments\n\nThe problem states:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n2.  The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M`\n`m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nNow, find `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNext, convert these masses into their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m₁c² = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   `m₂c² = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, the initial energy equals the final total energy (rest-mass energy + kinetic energy).\n\n`Mc² = (m₁c² + T₁) + (m₂c² + T₂)`\n`Mc² = (m₁c² + m₂c²) + (T₁ + T₂)`\n\nThe total kinetic energy of the fragments, `Q = T₁ + T₂`, is the energy released in the fission:\n`Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p²/2m`.\nFrom the conservation of momentum, the initial momentum is zero, so the final momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n\nTherefore:\n`T₁_classical = p² / (2m₁)`\n`T₂_classical = p² / (2m₂)`\n\nWe can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`\n`T₁_classical / T₂_classical = 99 GeV / 198 GeV = 1/2`\nSo, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n`T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Formulas\n\nThe relativistic relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The total energy `E` is also `E = T + mc²`.\nSubstituting `E` into the equation gives:\n`(T + mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`T² + 2Tmc² + (mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, `|p₁| = |p₂|`, so `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n`T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n\nWe know `T₁ + T₂ = Q = 3 GeV`, so `T₂ = 3 - T₁`. Substitute this and the rest-mass energies into the equation:\n`T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = T₁² - 204T₁ + 603`\n`396T₁ = -204T₁ + 603`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n`T₁_correct = 1005 MeV`\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct `T₁` value and the classically calculated `T₁` value.\n\n`Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV`\n`Difference = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest Masses and Energy Released\n\nFirst, we establish the rest masses of the initial nucleus (M) and the two fragments (m1 and m2).\n\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** The problem states the initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Relationship:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   **Sum of Fragment Masses:** The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nWe can solve for the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation: `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, which simplifies to `3*m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n2.  This gives `m2 = 0.33 * M`. Consequently, `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n3.  Now, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m1c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m2c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total rest-mass energy of the fragments.\n*   **Q-value:** `Q = Mc² - (m1c² + m2c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThis Q-value is the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T1\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is given by `T = p² / (2m)`. Due to the conservation of momentum, the initial momentum is zero, so the final momenta of the fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (`p1 = p2 = p`).\n\n*   From `p² = 2*m1*T1` and `p² = 2*m2*T2`, we get `m1*T1 = m2*T2`.\n*   This gives the ratio of kinetic energies: `T1 / T2 = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `T1 / T2 = 1/2`, which means `T2 = 2 * T1`.\n*   Substituting this into the total kinetic energy equation: `T1 + 2*T1 = Q`, so `3*T1 = Q`.\n*   **Classical T1:** `T1_classical = Q / 3 = 3 GeV / 3 = 1 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Relativistic Calculation of T1\n\nFor the correct relativistic calculation, we use the energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The total energy `E` is the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `mc²`.\n\n*   Rearranging the energy-momentum relation gives `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`), their squares are also equal: `(p1c)² = (p2c)²`.\n*   Therefore: `T1² + 2*T1*m1c² = T2² + 2*T2*m2c²`.\n*   We know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`. Substituting this into the equation:\n    `T1² + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)² + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n*   Expanding and simplifying the equation:\n    `T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    `T1² + 396*T1 = T1² - 204*T1 + 603`\n    `396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n*   **Relativistic T1:** `T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Difference\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1.\n\n*   **Difference:** `ΔT1 = T1_relativistic - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   To convert this to MeV, we multiply by 1000 (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    `ΔT1 = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 value and the value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1.

Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments:\n`E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (198 GeV)^2 - (99 GeV)^2`\nWe know `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`:\n`(E1 - E2)(300) = (198)^2 - (99)^2`\n`(E1 - E2)(300) = 39204 - 9801 = 29403`\n`E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations for `E1` and `E2`:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nAdding the two equations:\n`2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n`E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n`T1_rel = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**7. Calculate the difference:**\nDifference = `T1_rel - T1_classical`\nDifference = `1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nConvert the difference to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\nDifference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Define the initial conditions and conservation laws\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum: `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State (after fission):**\n    *   Two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2` and kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`.\n    *   From the problem statement, `m1` is the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n*   **Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the fission equals the total energy after.\n        `M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before is zero, so the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n        `|p1| = |p2| = p`\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments and the total kinetic energy\n\nFirst, we determine the rest-masses `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`.\n*   We have `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   Substituting this into `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, we get `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, which simplifies to `3*m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   This gives `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n*   And `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy (`Q-value`) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies:\n*   `T_total = T1 + T2 = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` are related by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n\nSince the momenta are equal (`p1=p2`), we can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow, using the total kinetic energy:\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest-mass `m` is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - m*c^2`.\nThis leads to the relation: `(p*c)^2 = T * (T + 2*m*c^2)`.\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 2*m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2*c^2)`\n\nWe substitute the known values (all in GeV):\n*   `T2 = 3 - T1`\n*   `m1*c^2 = 198`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99`\n\nThe equation becomes:\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2 * 99)`\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (3 - T1 + 198)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 3*T1 - 201*T1 + T1^2`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n*   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n*   `600*T1 = 603`\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is `T1_correct = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 5. Find the difference\n\nThe difference between the correct value and the classically calculated value is:\n*   `Difference = T1_correct - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\n*   **Initial rest-mass energy (M*c²):** 300 GeV\n*   **Relationship between fragment masses:** Let the masses of the two fragments be m₁ and m₂. We are given that one is twice as massive as the other, so let m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n*   **Sum of fragment masses:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.\n    *   m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n*   **Solving for the masses:**\n    *   Substitute m₁ = 2 * m₂ into the sum: 2*m₂ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n    *   3*m₂ = 0.99 * M  =>  m₂ = 0.33 * M\n    *   m₁ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n*   **Calculating the rest-mass energies of the fragments:**\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m₁c²): 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m₂c²): 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (T₁ + T₂).\n\n*   **Q = M*c² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)**\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n*   Q = 3000 MeV\n\n### 3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.\n\n*   **Conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂):**\n    *   The classical formula for kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\n    *   Therefore, p = √(2mT).\n    *   √(2m₁T₁_classical) = √(2m₂T₂_classical)  =>  m₁T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical.\n*   **Solving for T₁_classical:**\n    *   Since m₁ = 2m₂, we have 2m₂ * T₁_classical = m₂ * T₂_classical  =>  T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical.\n    *   The total kinetic energy is Q = T₁_classical + T₂_classical.\n    *   3 GeV = T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 * T₁_classical.\n    *   **T₁_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV.**\n\n### 4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, momentum and energy are related by the equation E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², where E is the total energy (E = T + mc²).\n\n*   **Relativistic momentum-energy relation:**\n    *   (pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc².\n*   **Conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂ => (p₁c)² = (p₂c)²):**\n    *   T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c².\n*   **Solving for T₁:**\n    *   We know T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 GeV - T₁. Substitute this into the equation.\n    *   T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)\n    *   T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)\n    *   396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁\n    *   396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁\n    *   600T₁ = 603\n    *   **T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV.**\n\n### 5.

Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments and the Q-value**\n\nFirst, let's find the rest-masses of the two fragments, $m_1$ and $m_2$. We are given:\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   The more massive fragment ($m_1$) is twice as massive as the other ($m_2$): $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   The sum of the fragments' rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$.\n\nSubstitute the first relation into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M$\n$3m_2 = 0.99 M$\n$m_2 = 0.33 M$\n\nNow, find $m_1$:\n$m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33 M) = 0.66 M$\n\nNext, let's find their rest-mass energies:\n*   $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe Q-value of the fission is the energy released, which is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments ($T_{total} = T_1 + T_2$). It's the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n$Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV})$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**2. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is $T = p^2 / (2m)$, where $p$ is the momentum.\nThe initial nucleus is at rest, so by the law of conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be $p$.\n$p_1 = p_2 = p$\n\nThe kinetic energies are:\n*   $T_{1, class} = p^2 / (2m_1)$\n*   $T_{2, class} = p^2 / (2m_2)$\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n$\\frac{T_{1, class}}{T_{2, class}} = \\frac{p^2 / (2m_1)}{p^2 / (2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33 M}{0.66 M} = \\frac{1}{2}$\nSo, $T_{2, class} = 2 T_{1, class}$.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is the Q-value:\n$T_{1, class} + T_{2, class} = Q$\n$T_{1, class} + 2 T_{1, class} = Q$\n$3 T_{1, class} = Q$\n$T_{1, class} = \\frac{Q}{3} = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV}}{3} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\nSo, the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is $T_{1, class} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy ($E$), momentum ($p$), and rest-mass ($m$) is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. The kinetic energy is $T = E - mc^2$.\nFrom this, we can write $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2$.\n\nSince the momenta are equal ($p_1 = p_2 = p$), we have:\n$(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1m_1c^2 = T_2^2 + 2T_2m_2c^2$\n\nSubstitute $T_2 = Q - T_1$:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1m_1c^2 = (Q - T_1)^2 + 2(Q - T_1)m_2c^2$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1m_1c^2 = (Q^2 - 2QT_1 + T_1^2) + (2Qm_2c^2 - 2T_1m_2c^2)$\n\nThe $T_1^2$ terms on both sides cancel out. Now, we group the terms with $T_1$:\n$2T_1m_1c^2 + 2QT_1 + 2T_1m_2c^2 = Q^2 + 2Qm_2c^2$\n$T_1 (2m_1c^2 + 2m_2c^2 + 2Q) = Q^2 + 2Qm_2c^2$\n$T_1 (2(m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + 2Q) = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n\nNow, solve for $T_1$ (which is the correct relativistic value, $T_{1, rel}$):\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)}{2((m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + Q)}$\n\nPlug in the values we found earlier:\n*   $Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_1c^2 = 198 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_2c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 = 297 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV} (3 \\text{ GeV} + 2 \\times 99 \\text{ GeV})}{2(297 \\text{ GeV} + 3 \\text{ GeV})}$\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 (3 + 198)}{2(300)} \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 \\times 201}{600} \\text{ GeV} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is $T_{1, rel} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**4. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = $T_{1, rel} - T_{1, class}$\nDifference = $1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Define the initial and final states\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   The more massive fragment is `m1`, and the less massive is `m2`.\n    *   `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, calculate their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1c^2 = 0.66 * Mc^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2c^2 = 0.33 * Mc^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released during the fission is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n\n`Q = T1 + T2 = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nFrom the conservation of momentum, the initial momentum is zero, so the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n\nTherefore:\n`p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical`\n`p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n\nThis gives us the relationship:\n`m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n`(0.66 * M) * T1_classical = (0.33 * M) * T2_classical`\n`2 * T1_classical = T2_classical`\n\nWe also know that the total kinetic energy is `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\nSubstituting `T2_classical`:\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1\n\nFor the relativistic case, we use the energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`, where total energy `E = T + mc^2`.\nThis can be rearranged to find the momentum: `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2`.\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c^2`\n\nWe know `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`, so `T2 = 3 - T1`. We also have the rest-mass energies `m1c^2 = 198 GeV` and `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n`T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms cancel out:\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 6. Find the difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert this value to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define Constants and Initial Values:** Set up the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus, `E_M`, in GeV.\n2.  **Calculate Fragment Masses:** Use the given relationships (`m1 = 2*m2` and `m1 + m2 = 0.99*M`) to determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments, `m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`.\n3.  **Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):** The total kinetic energy released, `Q`, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n4.  **Calculate Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical):** In the non-relativistic approximation, the total kinetic energy `Q` is shared between the fragments inversely proportional to their masses. We will calculate the kinetic energy `T1` for the more massive fragment (`m1`).\n5.  **Calculate Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1_relativistic):** Using the principles of energy and momentum conservation in special relativity, we will derive and calculate the correct kinetic energy `T1` for the more massive fragment. The total energy of the first fragment (`E1`) can be found using the formula: `E1 = ( (M*c^2)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2 ) / (2 * M*c^2)`. The kinetic energy is then `T1 = E1 - m1*c^2`.\n6.  **Find the Difference:** Calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values of `T1`.\n7.  **Convert to MeV and Conclude:** Convert the result from GeV to MeV and select the corresponding option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define Initial Values\n# Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus in GeV\nE_M_GeV = 300.0\n\n# Step 2: Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies\n# We have two equations:\n# 1) m1c2 + m2c2 = 0.99 * E_M_GeV\n# 2) m1c2 = 2 * m2c2\n# Substitute (2) into (1):\n# 2 * m2c2 + m2c2 = 0.99 * E_M_GeV\n# 3 * m2c2 = 0.99 * E_M_GeV\nm2c2_GeV = (0.99 * E_M_GeV) / 3.0\nm1c2_GeV = 2.0 * m2c2_GeV\n\n# Step 3: Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\n# Q is the energy released, which becomes the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\nQ_GeV = E_M_GeV - (m1c2_GeV + m2c2_GeV)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical)\n# In classical mechanics, momentum p is conserved (p1=p2=p), and T = p^2/(2m).\n# So, T1/T2 = m2/m1.\n# Also, T1 + T2 = Q.\n# This leads to T1 = Q * m2 / (m1 + m2).\n# In terms of rest-mass energies: T1 = Q * m2c2 / (m1c2 + m2c2)\nT1_classical_GeV = Q_GeV * m2c2_GeV / (m1c2_GeV + m2c2_GeV)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1_relativistic)\n# From relativistic energy-momentum conservation for a two-body decay from rest:\n# The total energy of the first fragment is E1 = (E_M^2 + (m1c2)^2 - (m2c2)^2) / (2 * E_M)\nE1_GeV = (E_M_GeV**2 + m1c2_GeV**2 - m2c2_GeV**2) / (2 * E_M_GeV)\n# The kinetic energy is T1 = E1 - m1c2\nT1_relativistic_GeV = E1_GeV - m1c2_GeV\n\n# Step 6: Find the Difference\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic_GeV - T1_classical_GeV\n\n# Step 7: Convert to MeV and Print the Result\n# 1 GeV = 1000 MeV\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Initial rest-mass energy (M*c^2): {E_M_GeV} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (m1*c^2): {m1c2_GeV:.2f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (m2*c^2): {m2c2_GeV:.2f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Total kinetic energy released (Q): {Q_GeV:.2f} GeV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical_GeV:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic_GeV:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"The difference between the relativistic and classical T1 is {difference_MeV:.2f} MeV.\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to option B.\")\n\n<<<B>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 54\n    <<<B>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments, let's call their rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's say $m_1$ is the more massive fragment, so $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  $m_1 = 2m_2$\n2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n$3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\n\nNow find $m_1$:\n$m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies using the initial rest-mass energy ($Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$):\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment ($m_1$): $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times Mc^2 = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment ($m_2$): $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times Mc^2 = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n$Q = (\\text{Initial rest energy}) - (\\text{Final rest energy})$\n$Q = Mc^2 - (m_1 + m_2)c^2$\n$Q = Mc^2 - (0.99M)c^2 = 0.01Mc^2$\n\nUsing the given value $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$:\n$Q = 0.01 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis Q-value is the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments:\n$T_{total} = T_1 + T_2 = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the fragments must be zero. This means they fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let $p_{cl}$ be the magnitude of the classical momentum for each fragment.\n    $p_1 = p_2 = p_{cl}$\n*   **Kinetic Energy:** In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = p^2 / (2m)$.\n    *   $T_{1,cl} = p_{cl}^2 / (2m_1)$\n    *   $T_{2,cl} = p_{cl}^2 / (2m_2)$\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:**\n    $\\frac{T_{1,cl}}{T_{2,cl}} = \\frac{p_{cl}^2 / (2m_1)}{p_{cl}^2 / (2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{m_2}{2m_2} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n    So, $T_{2,cl} = 2T_{1,cl}$.\n*   **Solving for T1:** We know the total kinetic energy is $Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    $T_{1,cl} + T_{2,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $T_{1,cl} + 2T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $3T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $T_{1,cl} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite: $p_1 = p_2 = p_{rel}$.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, where $E$ is the total energy ($E = T + mc^2$).\n    *   $E_1^2 = (p_{rel}c)^2 + (m_1c^2)^2$\n    *   $E_2^2 = (p_{rel}c)^2 + (m_2c^2)^2$\n*   **Solving for Energies:** From the relations above, we can equate the $(p_{rel}c)^2$ terms:\n    $E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n    $E_1^2 - E_2^2 = (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n    $(E_1 - E_2)(E_1 + E_2) = (m_1^2 - m_2^2)c^4$\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy is conserved. The initial total energy was $Mc^2$. The final total energy is $E_1 + E_2$.\n    $E_1 + E_2 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   **Finding E1:** Substitute the known values into the momentum equation:\n    $(E_1 - E_2)(300 \\text{ GeV}) = (198 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (99 \\text{ GeV})^2$\n    $(E_1 - E_2)(300) = 39204 - 9801 = 29403$\n    $E_1 - E_2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for $E_1$ and $E_2$:\n    1.  $E_1 + E_2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n    2.  $E_1 - E_2 = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$\n    Add the two equations to solve for $E_1$:\n    $2E_1 = 300 + 98.01 = 398.01 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $E_1 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   **Finding T1:** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy.\n    $T_{1,rel} = E_1 - m_1c^2$\n    $T_{1,rel} = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical value.\nDifference = $T_{1,rel} - T_{1,cl}$\nDifference = $1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1.000 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nFinally, convert the answer to MeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$):\nDifference = $0.005 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum is `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Mass relationship: `m1 = 2 * m2`. This also means their rest-mass energies are related by `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-mass energies is `E_final_rest = (m1 + m2)c^2 = 0.99 * Mc^2`.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2` and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nFirst, let's find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments.\n*   `E_final_rest = 0.99 * (300 GeV) = 297 GeV`.\n*   We have a system of two equations:\n    1.  `m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2`\n*   Substitute (2) into (1): `(2 * m2c^2) + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n*   `3 * m2c^2 = 297 GeV` => `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n*   From this, `m1c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\nThe energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = E_initial - E_final_rest = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. This means the fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes.\n*   `p1 = p2`.\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   Since `p1 = p2`, we have `p1^2 = p2^2`.\n*   `2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`.\n*   `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`.\n*   Substituting `m1 = 2*m2`: `(2*m2) * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical` => `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Now use the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 using Correct (Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (mc²) is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. The total energy is also `E = T + mc^2`.\n*   Substituting for E: `(T + mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\n*   Expanding and simplifying gives the relation for momentum: `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n*   From conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`.\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 2*m1c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2c^2)`.\n*   Substitute the known values: `m1c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`.\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2 * 99)`.\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`.\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2`.\n*   The `T1^2` terms cancel out.\n*   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`.\n*   `600*T1 = 603`.\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n*   `Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV:\n*   `Difference (MeV) = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of rest mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum: `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies `T₁` and `T₂` and momenta `p₁` and `p₂`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest Masses of the Fragments\n\nThe problem states:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n2.  The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M`\n`m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nNow, find `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNext, convert these masses into their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m₁c² = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   `m₂c² = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, the initial energy equals the final total energy (rest-mass energy + kinetic energy).\n\n`Mc² = (m₁c² + T₁) + (m₂c² + T₂)`\n`Mc² = (m₁c² + m₂c²) + (T₁ + T₂)`\n\nThe total kinetic energy of the fragments, `Q = T₁ + T₂`, is the energy released in the fission:\n`Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p²/2m`.\nFrom the conservation of momentum, the initial momentum is zero, so the final momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n\nTherefore:\n`T₁_classical = p² / (2m₁)`\n`T₂_classical = p² / (2m₂)`\n\nWe can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`\n`T₁_classical / T₂_classical = 99 GeV / 198 GeV = 1/2`\nSo, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n`T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Formulas\n\nThe relativistic relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The total energy `E` is also `E = T + mc²`.\nSubstituting `E` into the equation gives:\n`(T + mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`T² + 2Tmc² + (mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, `|p₁| = |p₂|`, so `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n`T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n\nWe know `T₁ + T₂ = Q = 3 GeV`, so `T₂ = 3 - T₁`. Substitute this and the rest-mass energies into the equation:\n`T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = T₁² - 204T₁ + 603`\n`396T₁ = -204T₁ + 603`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n`T₁_correct = 1005 MeV`\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct `T₁` value and the classically calculated `T₁` value.\n\n`Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV`\n`Difference = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest Masses and Energy Released\n\nFirst, we establish the rest masses of the initial nucleus (M) and the two fragments (m1 and m2).\n\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** The problem states the initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Relationship:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   **Sum of Fragment Masses:** The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nWe can solve for the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation: `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, which simplifies to `3*m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n2.  This gives `m2 = 0.33 * M`. Consequently, `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n3.  Now, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m1c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m2c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total rest-mass energy of the fragments.\n*   **Q-value:** `Q = Mc² - (m1c² + m2c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThis Q-value is the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T1\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is given by `T = p² / (2m)`. Due to the conservation of momentum, the initial momentum is zero, so the final momenta of the fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (`p1 = p2 = p`).\n\n*   From `p² = 2*m1*T1` and `p² = 2*m2*T2`, we get `m1*T1 = m2*T2`.\n*   This gives the ratio of kinetic energies: `T1 / T2 = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `T1 / T2 = 1/2`, which means `T2 = 2 * T1`.\n*   Substituting this into the total kinetic energy equation: `T1 + 2*T1 = Q`, so `3*T1 = Q`.\n*   **Classical T1:** `T1_classical = Q / 3 = 3 GeV / 3 = 1 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Relativistic Calculation of T1\n\nFor the correct relativistic calculation, we use the energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The total energy `E` is the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `mc²`.\n\n*   Rearranging the energy-momentum relation gives `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`), their squares are also equal: `(p1c)² = (p2c)²`.\n*   Therefore: `T1² + 2*T1*m1c² = T2² + 2*T2*m2c²`.\n*   We know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`. Substituting this into the equation:\n    `T1² + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)² + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n*   Expanding and simplifying the equation:\n    `T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    `T1² + 396*T1 = T1² - 204*T1 + 603`\n    `396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n*   **Relativistic T1:** `T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Difference\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1.\n\n*   **Difference:** `ΔT1 = T1_relativistic - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   To convert this to MeV, we multiply by 1000 (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    `ΔT1 = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 value and the value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1.

Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) of the fragments comes from the conversion of mass into energy.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = (Initial Mass Energy) - (Final Mass Energy)`\n`Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nFrom the conservation of momentum, the initial momentum is zero, so the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n`p1 = p2 = p`\n\nThe kinetic energies are:\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = 99 GeV / 198 GeV = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nThe kinetic energy is `T = E - m*c^2`.\nFrom this, we can derive the relationship between kinetic energy and momentum:\n`(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2 + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`\n\nFrom momentum conservation, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe know:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n*   `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV` => `T2 = 3 - T1`\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n\nCancel `T1^2` from both sides:\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\nThis is the correct relativistic kinetic energy for the more massive fragment.\n\n### 6.

Let the magnitude of the momentum be `p`.\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nSo, `p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_cl` and `p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_cl`.\nTherefore, `m1 * T1_cl = m2 * T2_cl`.\n`T2_cl / T1_cl = m1 / m2 = 2`, so `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cl + 2 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cl = 1 GeV`\n\n**Correct (Relativistic) Calculation**\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nThe total energy `E` is also `E = T + m*c^2`.\nSubstituting this gives `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nExpanding and simplifying, we get `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\nSince the momenta `p` are equal for both fragments:\n`(p*c)^2 = T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1. `T1 + T2 = 3`  => `T2 = 3 - T1`\n2. `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(99)`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*99`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\nThe `T1^2` terms cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**Difference**\nThe difference between the correct value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1 - T1_cl = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\nConverting to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1.

Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` are related by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n\nSince the momenta are equal (`p1=p2`), we can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow, using the total kinetic energy:\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest-mass `m` is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - m*c^2`.\nThis leads to the relation: `(p*c)^2 = T * (T + 2*m*c^2)`.\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 2*m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2*c^2)`\n\nWe substitute the known values (all in GeV):\n*   `T2 = 3 - T1`\n*   `m1*c^2 = 198`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99`\n\nThe equation becomes:\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2 * 99)`\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (3 - T1 + 198)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 3*T1 - 201*T1 + T1^2`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n*   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n*   `600*T1 = 603`\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is `T1_correct = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 5. Find the difference\n\nThe difference between the correct value and the classically calculated value is:\n*   `Difference = T1_correct - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\n*   **Initial rest-mass energy (M*c²):** 300 GeV\n*   **Relationship between fragment masses:** Let the masses of the two fragments be m₁ and m₂. We are given that one is twice as massive as the other, so let m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n*   **Sum of fragment masses:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.\n    *   m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n*   **Solving for the masses:**\n    *   Substitute m₁ = 2 * m₂ into the sum: 2*m₂ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n    *   3*m₂ = 0.99 * M  =>  m₂ = 0.33 * M\n    *   m₁ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n*   **Calculating the rest-mass energies of the fragments:**\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m₁c²): 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m₂c²): 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (T₁ + T₂).\n\n*   **Q = M*c² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)**\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n*   Q = 3000 MeV\n\n### 3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.\n\n*   **Conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂):**\n    *   The classical formula for kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\n    *   Therefore, p = √(2mT).\n    *   √(2m₁T₁_classical) = √(2m₂T₂_classical)  =>  m₁T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical.\n*   **Solving for T₁_classical:**\n    *   Since m₁ = 2m₂, we have 2m₂ * T₁_classical = m₂ * T₂_classical  =>  T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical.\n    *   The total kinetic energy is Q = T₁_classical + T₂_classical.\n    *   3 GeV = T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 * T₁_classical.\n    *   **T₁_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV.**\n\n### 4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, momentum and energy are related by the equation E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², where E is the total energy (E = T + mc²).\n\n*   **Relativistic momentum-energy relation:**\n    *   (pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc².\n*   **Conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂ => (p₁c)² = (p₂c)²):**\n    *   T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c².\n*   **Solving for T₁:**\n    *   We know T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 GeV - T₁. Substitute this into the equation.\n    *   T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)\n    *   T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)\n    *   396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁\n    *   396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁\n    *   600T₁ = 603\n    *   **T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV.**\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference is the relativistic value minus the classical value.\n\n*   **Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)**\n*   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Define the initial and final states:**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass is M.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   We are given m₁ = 2m₂.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest-masses of the fragments:**\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  m₁ = 2m₂\n2.  m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M\n3m₂ = 0.99M\nm₂ = 0.33M\n\nNow, find m₁:\nm₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   m₁c² = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   m₂c² = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\n\nBy conservation of energy, the initial rest-mass energy is converted into the final rest-mass energy plus the kinetic energy of the fragments (T₁ + T₂).\n\nT₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\nT₁ + T₂ = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\nT₁ + T₂ = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Calculate T₁ using the correct relativistic formulas:**\n\nSince the initial nucleus is at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of the momentum of each fragment be 'p'.\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². This can be rewritten as (pc)² = E² - (m c²)².\nSince E = T + mc², we have (pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc².\n\nFor the two fragments:\n*   (pc)² = T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²)\n*   (pc)² = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)\n\nEquating these two expressions:\nT₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)\n\nWe also know that T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁. Substitute this and the rest-mass energies into the equation:\nT₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)\nT₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)\nT₁² + 396T₁ = T₁² - 204T₁ + 603\n396T₁ = -204T₁ + 603\n600T₁ = 603\nT₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\nThis is the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n**5. Calculate T₁ using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation:**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p²/(2m).\nSince the momenta are equal (p₁ = p₂ = p):\n*   p² = 2m₁T₁_classical\n*   p² = 2m₂T₂_classical\n\nTherefore:\n2m₁T₁_classical = 2m₂T₂_classical\nm₁T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical\n\nSince m₁ = 2m₂, we have:\n2m₂T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical\nT₂_classical = 2T₁_classical\n\nThe total kinetic energy is the same:\nT₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV\nT₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n3T₁_classical = 3 GeV\nT₁_classical = 1 GeV.\n\nThis is the classical approximation for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n**6. Find the difference:**\n\nDifference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)\nDifference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nFinally, convert the difference to MeV:\nDifference = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
