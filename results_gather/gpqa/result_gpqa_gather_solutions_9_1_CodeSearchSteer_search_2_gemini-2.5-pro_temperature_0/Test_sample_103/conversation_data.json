The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight. The maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, denoted as K.\n    Therefore, K is proportional to Δλ_max.\n    We can write the ratio for the two systems:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 mÅ / 7 mÅ = 5/7\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude (K) Formula:**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n    K = (M_p / M_star) * v_p * sin(i)\n    where M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, v_p is the planet's orbital speed, and 'i' is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n3.  **Relate Planet's Velocity to Orbital Period:**\n    The planet's orbital speed (v_p) is the circumference of its orbit divided by the orbital period (P):\n    v_p = 2πa / P\n    where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\n4.  **Use Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (P) and the semi-major axis (a):\n    P² = (4π² / (G * (M_star + M_p))) * a³\n    Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (M_p << M_star), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.\n    P² ≈ (4π² / (G * M_star)) * a³\n    We can rearrange this to solve for 'a':\n    a³ ≈ (G * M_star * P²) / 4π²\n    a ≈ (G * M_star / 4π²)^(1/3) * P^(2/3)\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    Now, substitute the expressions for v_p and 'a' back into the formula for K:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (2πa / P) * sin(i)\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (2π / P) * [(G * M_star / 4π²)^(1/3) * P^(2/3)] * sin(i)\n    By combining the constants and simplifying the terms involving M_star and P, we find the proportionality:\n    K ∝ M_p * M_star^(-2/3) * P^(-1/3) * sin(i)\n\n6.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:**\n    The problem states that the stars have the same mass (M_star1 = M_star2) and the planets have similar masses (M_p1 ≈ M_p2). For a unique solution to exist, we must also assume the orbital inclinations are the same (sin(i₁) = sin(i₂)). With these conditions, all terms in the proportionality are constant for both systems except for K and P.\n    Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n    K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n7.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:**\n    We can now write a ratio for the two systems:\n    K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n    We know K₁ / K₂ = 5/7. So:\n    5/7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n    To find the ratio of the periods (P₂ / P₁), we cube both sides of the equation:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (5/7)³\n    P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):**\n    The Doppler effect for light relates the change in wavelength (Δλ) to the radial velocity (v_r) of the source:\n    Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c\n    where λ₀ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n\n    This means that the amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift (Δλ_max) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity variation (K).\n    K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n    For the two planets, we have:\n    *   K₁ ∝ Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n    *   K₂ ∝ Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\n    The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is therefore:\n    K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit detected via the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i)) / (M_star + mₚ)^(2/3)\n\n    Let's analyze the terms based on the information provided:\n    *   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n    *   **P** is the orbital period we need to relate.\n    *   **mₚ** is the planet's mass. The problem states both planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of RV measurements, this typically refers to the minimum mass, mₚ sin(i). We will assume (mₚ sin(i)) is the same for both systems.\n    *   **i** is the orbital inclination. As mentioned above, it's part of the mₚ sin(i) term.\n    *   **M_star** is the star's mass. The problem states the two stars have \"exactly the same masses.\"\n    *   The term (M_star + mₚ) can be approximated as M_star, since the mass of a Sun-like star is much greater than the mass of a Neptune-like planet.\n\n    Since M_star and mₚ sin(i) are the same for both systems, all parts of the equation are constant except for K and P. This gives us the proportionality:\n    K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    We can rearrange the proportionality to solve for the period, P:\n    If K ∝ P^(-1/3), then K³ ∝ P⁻¹, which means P ∝ K⁻³.\n\n    Now we can find the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 (P₂) to that of planet #1 (P₁):\n    P₂ / P₁ = (K₂ / K₁)⁻³ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n    Using the ratio of the radial velocities we found in step 1:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n\n    Calculating the final value:\n    P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity (K):** The Doppler effect tells us that the observed shift in a spectral line's wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity of the source (the star, in this case). Therefore, the amplitude of the velocity variation, known as the RV semi-amplitude (K), is proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift.\n    *   `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   This means the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts: `K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁`.\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to Orbital Period (T):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude (K) of its host star is given by a formula derived from Kepler's and Newton's laws. The key relationship for our problem is:\n    *   `K ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)`\n    *   This relationship holds true because the problem states that the masses of the stars are identical (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the masses of the planets are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). We also assume the orbital inclinations are comparable for this analysis.\n    *   From this proportionality, we can write the ratio: `K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`.\n\n3.  **Combine and Solve for the Period Ratio (T₂ / T₁):** We now have two different expressions for the same ratio, `K₂ / K₁`. We can set them equal to each other:\n    *   `Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`\n    *   To solve for our target ratio, `T₂ / T₁`, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   `(Δλ₂ / Δλ₁)^3 = T₁ / T₂`\n    *   Finally, we take the reciprocal of both sides to get the desired ratio:\n    *   `T₂ / T₁ = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)^3`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value:** We will now plug the given values into the formula and calculate the result.\n    *   `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstrom\n    *   `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstrom\n\n```python\n# Given values from the problem\ndelta_lambda_1 = 5  # Wavelength shift for planet #1 in miliangstrom\ndelta_lambda_2 = 7  # Wavelength shift for planet #2 in miliangstrom\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods (T2 / T1) is related to the ratio of the\n# wavelength shifts (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2) to the power of 3.\n# T2 / T1 = (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)^3\nperiod_ratio = (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2) ** 3\n\n# The available choices\nchoices = {\n    \"A\": 0.85,\n    \"B\": 1.40,\n    \"C\": 0.36,\n    \"D\": 1.96\n}\n\n# Print the calculated result and the choices\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of the orbital periods (T2 / T1) is: {period_ratio:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) ~ {choices['A']}\")\nprint(f\"B) ~ {choices['B']}\")\nprint(f\"C) ~ {choices['C']}\")\nprint(f\"D) ~ {choices['D']}\")\n\n# Determine the closest choice\nclosest_choice = min(choices, key=lambda k: abs(choices[k] - period_ratio))\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option {closest_choice}.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated ratio of the orbital periods (T2 / T1) is: 0.36\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.4\nC) ~ 0.36\nD) ~ 1.96\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option C.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method relies on the Doppler effect. The shift in the wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) of a spectral line is directly proportional to the radial velocity ($v_r$) of the star along our line of sight. The formula is:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem gives the *maximum* periodic shift, which corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star. This maximum velocity is the amplitude of the RV curve, denoted as $K$.\n    *   For planet #1, the maximum shift is $\\Delta\\lambda_{max,1} = 5$ miliangstrom.\n    *   For planet #2, the maximum shift is $\\Delta\\lambda_{max,2} = 7$ miliangstrom.\n\n    Since $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, we can find the ratio of the RV amplitudes for the two stars:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max,2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max,1}} = \\frac{7 \\text{ mÅ}}{5 \\text{ mÅ}} = 1.4$\n\n2.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters**\n    For a planet of mass $m_p$ orbiting a star of mass $M_*$ in a circular orbit with period $P$, the RV amplitude $K$ is given by:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_*^{2/3}}$\n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n3.  **Apply the Given Conditions and Assumptions**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{*,1} = M_{*,2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p,1} = m_{p,2}$.\n    *   The problem does not mention the orbital inclinations. A standard and necessary assumption in such problems is that the viewing conditions are comparable, meaning the inclinations are the same: $\\sin(i_1) = \\sin(i_2)$.\n\n    With these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a direct relationship between $K$ and $P$:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio of the Periods**\n    From the relationship $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$, we can write:\n    $K \\cdot P^{1/3} = \\text{constant}$\n\n    Applying this to our two systems:\n    $K_1 \\cdot P_1^{1/3} = K_2 \\cdot P_2^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio $P_2 / P_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2^{1/3}}{P_1^{1/3}} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n    $\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n\n    To solve for $P_2 / P_1$, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n    We already found that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$. Therefore, the inverse ratio is $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\n    Now, substitute this value into our equation for the period ratio:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proportionality:** The core of the problem is understanding that the maximum wavelength shift is directly proportional to the RV amplitude $K$.\n*   **Key Formula:** The relationship $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$ is crucial. It is derived by combining the definition of the star's velocity due to its planet with Kepler's Third Law.\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the stated conditions (equal star and planet masses) and the implicit assumption that the orbital inclinations are the same for both systems.\n*   **Inverse Relationship:** A larger RV amplitude ($K$) implies a stronger gravitational pull at a closer distance, which means a shorter orbital period ($P$). Since planet #2 induces a larger shift ($K_2 > K_1$), its period must be shorter ($P_2 < P_1$), so the ratio $P_2/P_1$ must be less than 1. This provides a quick sanity check of the result.\n*   **Exponents:** It is easy to make a mistake with the exponents. The final ratio is cubed, not taken to the power of 1/3 or -1/3. The ratio of periods is $(K_1/K_2)^3$, not $(K_2/K_1)^3$.\n\nThe calculated ratio of ~0.36 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by observing the \"wobble\" of their host star. A planet's gravitational pull causes its star to move in a small orbit around their common center of mass. This movement causes a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines due to the Doppler effect. When the star moves towards us, its light is blueshifted; when it moves away, it is redshifted. The maximum velocity of this wobble along our line of sight is called the radial velocity semi-amplitude, denoted as K.\n\n### 2. Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity\n\nThe observed periodic shift in the wavelength of a spectral line (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n\nGiven:\n*   Maximum wavelength shift for star 1 (Δλ₁): 5 milliangstroms\n*   Maximum wavelength shift for star 2 (Δλ₂): 7 milliangstroms\n\nSince K is proportional to Δλ_max, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:\nK₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n### 3. Use the Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0) is:\n\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   m_p is the planet's mass.\n*   M_star is the star's mass.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 4. Simplify the Formula Based on the Given Information\n\nThe problem provides the following key details:\n*   The stars have the same mass: M_star1 = M_star2.\n*   The planets have similar masses, like Neptune: m_p1 ≈ m_p2.\n*   The orbits are circular: e=0.\n\nThe term m_p * sin(i) represents the \"minimum mass\" that can be measured by the RV method, as the inclination 'i' is often unknown. The problem states the *planets'* masses are similar, which implies we can assume the term (m_p * sin(i)) is constant for both systems.\n\nWith these simplifications, most terms in the formula become constant for both planets. The relationship between K and P simplifies to:\n\nK ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n### 5. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nWe can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nNow, we can solve for the ratio of the periods (P₂ / P₁):\n\nP₁ / P₂ = (K₂ / K₁)^3\n\nWe want to find how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁.\n\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / (K₂ / K₁)^3 = (K₁ / K₂)^3\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3\n\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.36\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe search results confirm the physics and formulas I used.\n\nSpecifically, result provides the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for circular orbits (e=0):\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_star + M_p)^(2/3)\n\nThe problem states M_p is similar to Neptune and M_star is similar to the Sun. M_Neptune is about 17 times M_Earth, and M_Sun is about 333,000 times M_Earth. So, M_p << M_star, and the approximation (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star is valid.\n\nThe formula becomes:\nK ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)\n\nThis confirms that K is proportional to P^(-1/3), assuming all other factors are constant between the two systems.\n\nThe problem states:\n- M_star1 = M_star2 (given)\n- m_p1 ≈ m_p2 (given as \"similar masses\")\n- The RV method measures M_p * sin(i), so the most reasonable interpretation is that M_p1*sin(i1) ≈ M_p2*sin(i2).\n\nThe wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity (K).\n\nTherefore, the logic holds:\n1.  K is proportional to Δλ.\n    K2 / K1 = Δλ2 / Δλ1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n2.  K is proportional to P^(-1/3).\n    K2 / K1 = (P2 / P1)^(-1/3) = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)\n3.  Equating the two expressions for K2 / K1:\n    1.4 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)\n4.  Solving for P2 / P1:\n    (1.4)³ = P1 / P2\n    2.744 = P1 / P2\n    P2 / P1 = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe result is robust. The answer is approximately 0.36.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 0.36\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nMy calculated value matches option C.\n\nThe problem is a straightforward application of the radial velocity formula, requiring careful algebraic manipulation. The key is to correctly identify the relationship K ∝ P^(-1/3) and to make the standard assumption that \"similar masses\" in an RV context refers to the observable quantity `m_p * sin(i)`.\n\nThe calculation is complete and verified. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\n1.  **State the relationship between wavelength shift and radial velocity amplitude.** The amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is directly proportional to the observed periodic wavelength shift (Δλ).\n2.  **Calculate the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes.** K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7/5 = 1.4.\n3.  **State the formula for the radial velocity amplitude.** For a planet in a circular orbit, K is proportional to M_p*sin(i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)).\n4.  **Apply the given conditions.** The stars have the same mass (M₁ = M₂), and the planets have similar masses (implying m_p₁*sin(i₁) ≈ m_p₂*sin(i₂)).\n5.  **Simplify the relationship.** Under these conditions, K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3).\n6.  **Set up the equation.** K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3).\n7.  **Solve for the period ratio.**\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n    (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644.\n8.  **Compare with the options.** The calculated value of ~0.36 matches option C.\n\nThe reasoning is sound. I will now write the final response.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to relate the observed periodic wavelength shift to the orbital period of the exoplanet using the principles of the Radial Velocity (RV) method.\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The periodic shift in the spectral line's wavelength (Δλ) is caused by the Doppler effect due to the star's motion along our line of sight. This motion is induced by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The amplitude of the star's radial velocity (denoted as K) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Formula:** The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) for a star with an orbiting planet is given by the formula:\n    K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\n    This formula applies under the given conditions: circular orbits (eccentricity e=0) and a planet mass (m_p) much smaller than the star's mass (M_star). Here, P is the orbital period, G is the gravitational constant, m_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and i is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Applying the Given Information:** We are given that:\n    *   The stars have identical masses: M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂. In the context of the RV method, the measured quantity is the minimum mass, m_p * sin(i). The problem's phrasing implies that this value is similar for both planets, so we can assume m_p₁ * sin(i₁) ≈ m_p₂ * sin(i₂).\n\n4.  **Finding the Relationship between K and P:** Since M_star and m_p * sin(i) are the same for both systems, the formula simplifies to show that the radial velocity amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period P:\n    K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** We can now set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We already calculated that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. Substituting this value:\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. We find this by taking the reciprocal:\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36. Comparing this to the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the gravitational pull they exert on their host star. This pull causes the star to \"wobble,\" moving towards and away from us. This movement induces a periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:** The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight. The maximum measured wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, known as the velocity amplitude (K).\n    *   Δλ ∝ K\n\n3.  **The Velocity Amplitude Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0), the velocity amplitude K is given by:\n    *   K = ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\n    Where:\n        *   P is the orbital period of the planet.\n        *   m_p is the mass of the planet.\n        *   M_star is the mass of the star.\n        *   G is the gravitational constant.\n        *   i is the inclination of the orbit.\n\n4.  **Apply the Given Information:** The problem states that for both systems:\n    *   The mass of the stars are the same (M_star1 = M_star2).\n    *   The mass of the planets are the same (m_p1 = m_p2).\n    *   We can assume the orbital inclinations (i) are comparable, as is standard in such problems unless stated otherwise.\n\n    Therefore, the term `(m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))` is a constant for both planets. This simplifies the relationship between the velocity amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P) to:\n    *   K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n5.  **Establish the Ratio:** Since the wavelength shift (Δλ) is proportional to K, we can also say:\n    *   Δλ ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n    We can now write a ratio for the two planets:\n    *   (Δλ₂ / Δλ₁) = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n6.  **Substitute the Values and Solve:** We are given:\n    *   Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n    *   Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n\n    Substituting these into the ratio:\n    *   (7 / 5) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   (7 / 5)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    *   343 / 125 = P₁ / P₂\n    *   2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n7.  **Find the Final Answer:** The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. We take the reciprocal of the previous result:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 = 125 / 343\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it is significantly shorter.

The magnitude of this shift is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum measured wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is known as the semi-amplitude, K.\n\n    Therefore, we can establish a ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes for the two stars:\n    K₁ ∝ Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n    K₂ ∝ Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\n    The ratio is K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4.\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude (K) of the host star's radial velocity is given by the formula:\n\n    K = ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i)) / (Mₛ + mₚ)^(2/3)\n\n    Where:\n    *   `P` is the orbital period of the planet.\n    *   `mₚ` is the mass of the planet.\n    *   `Mₛ` is the mass of the star.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n    The term `mₚ sin(i)` is the \"minimum mass\" of the planet, which is the quantity directly measured by the RV method.\n\n3.  **Set up a Ratio for the Two Systems**\n    We can write the expression for K for each of the two star-planet systems:\n\n    K₁ = ( (2πG) / P₁ )^(1/3) * (mₚ₁ sin(i₁)) / (Mₛ₁ + mₚ₁)^(2/3)\n    K₂ = ( (2πG) / P₂ )^(1/3) * (mₚ₂ sin(i₂)) / (Mₛ₂ + mₚ₂)^(2/3)\n\n    Now, we can create a ratio of K₂ to K₁:\n\n    K₂ / K₁ = [ (P₁/P₂)^(1/3) ] * [ (mₚ₂ sin(i₂)) / (mₚ₁ sin(i₁)) ] * [ (Mₛ₁ + mₚ₁)^(2/3) / (Mₛ₂ + mₚ₂)^(2/3) ]\n\n4.  **Apply the Given Information**\n    Let's simplify this ratio using the details from the problem description:\n    *   The stars have \"exactly the same masses\" (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂).\n    *   The planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune\" and the stars have masses \"similar to that of our Sun\". This means the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (mₚ << Mₛ). Therefore, we can approximate (Mₛ + mₚ) ≈ Mₛ. With Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂, this term cancels out.\n    *   The planets were detected using the RV method and both have \"masses similar to that of Neptune\".

    "Based on an analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the final, correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift (Δλ) to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method works by detecting the Doppler shift in a star's light caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The observed shift in wavelength, Δλ, is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. The maximum periodic shift, Δλ_max, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, denoted as K.\n    *   Therefore, `K ∝ Δλ_max`.\n    *   For the two systems, the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes is:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:\n    `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    This is a standard approximation where the planet's mass (`m_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`).\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions to Simplify the Formula:**\n    The problem states that several key parameters are the same for both systems:\n    *   The stars have identical masses (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n    *   The planets have similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).\n    *   In the context of the RV method, the measured quantity is the \"minimum mass,\" `m_p * sin(i)`. The problem's statement implies this value is the same for both systems.\n    *   The gravitational constant `G` and `2π` are constants.\n\n    With these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a direct proportionality between K and the orbital period P:\n    *   `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Combine Relationships and Solve for the Period Ratio:**\n    We can now set up a ratio for the two systems using the proportionality from Step 3:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\n    We already know from Step 1 that `K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n    `5 / 7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\n    To find the ratio `P₂ / P₁`, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value:**\n    `P₂ / P₁ = 5³ / 7³ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proportionality:** It is essential to correctly identify that the RV amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the wavelength shift `Δλ`, but inversely proportional to the cube root of the period `P`.\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption that when planet masses are described as \"similar\" in an RV problem, it refers to the measured minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`.\n*   **Ratio Direction:** A crucial sanity check is to note that planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (`Δλ₂ > Δλ₁`), which implies a larger stellar velocity (`K₂ > K₁`). A larger velocity is caused by a planet in a closer, shorter-period orbit. Therefore, the period of planet #2 should be shorter than that of planet #1, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. The result of ~0.36 is consistent with this physical intuition.\n*   **Algebra:** The final step requires cubing the ratio of the velocities (or wavelength shifts). A common mistake is to use the wrong power or invert the ratio. The correct formula is `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`.\n\nComparing the calculated value of ~0.36 to the provided options:\nA) ~ 1.40\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nThe calculated result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight. The maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, denoted as K.\n    Therefore, K is proportional to Δλ_max.\n    We can write the ratio for the two systems:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 mÅ / 7 mÅ = 5/7\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude (K) Formula:**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n    K = (M_p / M_star) * v_p * sin(i)\n    where M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, v_p is the planet's orbital speed, and 'i' is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n3.  **Relate Planet's Velocity to Orbital Period:**\n    The planet's orbital speed (v_p) is the circumference of its orbit divided by the orbital period (P):\n    v_p = 2πa / P\n    where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\n4.  **Use Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (P) and the semi-major axis (a):\n    P² = (4π² / (G * (M_star + M_p))) * a³\n    Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (M_p << M_star), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.\n    P² ≈ (4π² / (G * M_star)) * a³\n    We can rearrange this to solve for 'a':\n    a³ ≈ (G * M_star * P²) / 4π²\n    a ≈ (G * M_star / 4π²)^(1/3) * P^(2/3)\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    Now, substitute the expressions for v_p and 'a' back into the formula for K:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (2πa / P) * sin(i)\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (2π / P) * [(G * M_star / 4π²)^(1/3) * P^(2/3)] * sin(i)\n    By combining the constants and simplifying the terms involving M_star and P, we find the proportionality:\n    K ∝ M_p * M_star^(-2/3) * P^(-1/3) * sin(i)\n\n6.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:**\n    The problem states that the stars have the same mass (M_star1 = M_star2) and the planets have similar masses (M_p1 ≈ M_p2). For a unique solution to exist, we must also assume the orbital inclinations are the same (sin(i₁) = sin(i₂)). With these conditions, all terms in the proportionality are constant for both systems except for K and P.\n    Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n    K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n7.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:**\n    We can now write a ratio for the two systems:\n    K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n    We know K₁ / K₂ = 5/7. So:\n    5/7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n    To find the ratio of the periods (P₂ / P₁), we cube both sides of the equation:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (5/7)³\n    P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):**\n    The Doppler effect for light relates the change in wavelength (Δλ) to the radial velocity (v_r) of the source:\n    Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c\n    where λ₀ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n\n    This means that the amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift (Δλ_max) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity variation (K).\n    K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n    For the two planets, we have:\n    *   K₁ ∝ Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n    *   K₂ ∝ Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\n    The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is therefore:\n    K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit detected via the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i)) / (M_star + mₚ)^(2/3)\n\n    Let's analyze the terms based on the information provided:\n    *   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n    *   **P** is the orbital period we need to relate.\n    *   **mₚ** is the planet's mass. The problem states both planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of RV measurements, this typically refers to the minimum mass, mₚ sin(i). We will assume (mₚ sin(i)) is the same for both systems.\n    *   **i** is the orbital inclination. As mentioned above, it's part of the mₚ sin(i) term.\n    *   **M_star** is the star's mass. The problem states the two stars have \"exactly the same masses.\"\n    *   The term (M_star + mₚ) can be approximated as M_star, since the mass of a Sun-like star is much greater than the mass of a Neptune-like planet.\n\n    Since M_star and mₚ sin(i) are the same for both systems, all parts of the equation are constant except for K and P. This gives us the proportionality:\n    K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    We can rearrange the proportionality to solve for the period, P:\n    If K ∝ P^(-1/3), then K³ ∝ P⁻¹, which means P ∝ K⁻³.\n\n    Now we can find the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 (P₂) to that of planet #1 (P₁):\n    P₂ / P₁ = (K₂ / K₁)⁻³ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n    Using the ratio of the radial velocities we found in step 1:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n\n    Calculating the final value:\n    P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity (K):** The Doppler effect tells us that the observed shift in a spectral line's wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity of the source (the star, in this case). Therefore, the amplitude of the velocity variation, known as the RV semi-amplitude (K), is proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift.\n    *   `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   This means the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts: `K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁`.\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to Orbital Period (T):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude (K) of its host star is given by a formula derived from Kepler's and Newton's laws. The key relationship for our problem is:\n    *   `K ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)`\n    *   This relationship holds true because the problem states that the masses of the stars are identical (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the masses of the planets are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). We also assume the orbital inclinations are comparable for this analysis.\n    *   From this proportionality, we can write the ratio: `K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`.\n\n3.  **Combine and Solve for the Period Ratio (T₂ / T₁):** We now have two different expressions for the same ratio, `K₂ / K₁`. We can set them equal to each other:\n    *   `Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`\n    *   To solve for our target ratio, `T₂ / T₁`, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   `(Δλ₂ / Δλ₁)^3 = T₁ / T₂`\n    *   Finally, we take the reciprocal of both sides to get the desired ratio:\n    *   `T₂ / T₁ = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)^3`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value:** We will now plug the given values into the formula and calculate the result.\n    *   `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstrom\n    *   `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstrom\n\n```python\n# Given values from the problem\ndelta_lambda_1 = 5  # Wavelength shift for planet #1 in miliangstrom\ndelta_lambda_2 = 7  # Wavelength shift for planet #2 in miliangstrom\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods (T2 / T1) is related to the ratio of the\n# wavelength shifts (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2) to the power of 3.\n# T2 / T1 = (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)^3\nperiod_ratio = (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2) ** 3\n\n# The available choices\nchoices = {\n    \"A\": 0.85,\n    \"B\": 1.40,\n    \"C\": 0.36,\n    \"D\": 1.96\n}\n\n# Print the calculated result and the choices\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of the orbital periods (T2 / T1) is: {period_ratio:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) ~ {choices['A']}\")\nprint(f\"B) ~ {choices['B']}\")\nprint(f\"C) ~ {choices['C']}\")\nprint(f\"D) ~ {choices['D']}\")\n\n# Determine the closest choice\nclosest_choice = min(choices, key=lambda k: abs(choices[k] - period_ratio))\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option {closest_choice}.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated ratio of the orbital periods (T2 / T1) is: 0.36\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.4\nC) ~ 0.36\nD) ~ 1.96\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option C.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method relies on the Doppler effect. The shift in the wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) of a spectral line is directly proportional to the radial velocity ($v_r$) of the star along our line of sight. The formula is:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem gives the *maximum* periodic shift, which corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star. This maximum velocity is the amplitude of the RV curve, denoted as $K$.\n    *   For planet #1, the maximum shift is $\\Delta\\lambda_{max,1} = 5$ miliangstrom.\n    *   For planet #2, the maximum shift is $\\Delta\\lambda_{max,2} = 7$ miliangstrom.\n\n    Since $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, we can find the ratio of the RV amplitudes for the two stars:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max,2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max,1}} = \\frac{7 \\text{ mÅ}}{5 \\text{ mÅ}} = 1.4$\n\n2.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters**\n    For a planet of mass $m_p$ orbiting a star of mass $M_*$ in a circular orbit with period $P$, the RV amplitude $K$ is given by:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_*^{2/3}}$\n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n3.  **Apply the Given Conditions and Assumptions**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{*,1} = M_{*,2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p,1} = m_{p,2}$.\n    *   The problem does not mention the orbital inclinations. A standard and necessary assumption in such problems is that the viewing conditions are comparable, meaning the inclinations are the same: $\\sin(i_1) = \\sin(i_2)$.\n\n    With these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a direct relationship between $K$ and $P$:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio of the Periods**\n    From the relationship $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$, we can write:\n    $K \\cdot P^{1/3} = \\text{constant}$\n\n    Applying this to our two systems:\n    $K_1 \\cdot P_1^{1/3} = K_2 \\cdot P_2^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio $P_2 / P_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2^{1/3}}{P_1^{1/3}} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n    $\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n\n    To solve for $P_2 / P_1$, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n    We already found that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$. Therefore, the inverse ratio is $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\n    Now, substitute this value into our equation for the period ratio:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proportionality:** The core of the problem is understanding that the maximum wavelength shift is directly proportional to the RV amplitude $K$.\n*   **Key Formula:** The relationship $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$ is crucial. It is derived by combining the definition of the star's velocity due to its planet with Kepler's Third Law.\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the stated conditions (equal star and planet masses) and the implicit assumption that the orbital inclinations are the same for both systems.\n*   **Inverse Relationship:** A larger RV amplitude ($K$) implies a stronger gravitational pull at a closer distance, which means a shorter orbital period ($P$). Since planet #2 induces a larger shift ($K_2 > K_1$), its period must be shorter ($P_2 < P_1$), so the ratio $P_2/P_1$ must be less than 1. This provides a quick sanity check of the result.\n*   **Exponents:** It is easy to make a mistake with the exponents. The final ratio is cubed, not taken to the power of 1/3 or -1/3. The ratio of periods is $(K_1/K_2)^3$, not $(K_2/K_1)^3$.\n\nThe calculated ratio of ~0.36 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by observing the \"wobble\" of their host star. A planet's gravitational pull causes its star to move in a small orbit around their common center of mass. This movement causes a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines due to the Doppler effect. When the star moves towards us, its light is blueshifted; when it moves away, it is redshifted. The maximum velocity of this wobble along our line of sight is called the radial velocity semi-amplitude, denoted as K.\n\n### 2. Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity\n\nThe observed periodic shift in the wavelength of a spectral line (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n\nGiven:\n*   Maximum wavelength shift for star 1 (Δλ₁): 5 milliangstroms\n*   Maximum wavelength shift for star 2 (Δλ₂): 7 milliangstroms\n\nSince K is proportional to Δλ_max, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:\nK₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n### 3. Use the Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0) is:\n\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   m_p is the planet's mass.\n*   M_star is the star's mass.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 4. Simplify the Formula Based on the Given Information\n\nThe problem provides the following key details:\n*   The stars have the same mass: M_star1 = M_star2.\n*   The planets have similar masses, like Neptune: m_p1 ≈ m_p2.\n*   The orbits are circular: e=0.\n\nThe term m_p * sin(i) represents the \"minimum mass\" that can be measured by the RV method, as the inclination 'i' is often unknown. The problem states the *planets'* masses are similar, which implies we can assume the term (m_p * sin(i)) is constant for both systems.\n\nWith these simplifications, most terms in the formula become constant for both planets. The relationship between K and P simplifies to:\n\nK ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n### 5. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nWe can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nNow, we can solve for the ratio of the periods (P₂ / P₁):\n\nP₁ / P₂ = (K₂ / K₁)^3\n\nWe want to find how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁.\n\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / (K₂ / K₁)^3 = (K₁ / K₂)^3\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3\n\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.36\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe search results confirm the physics and formulas I used.\n\nSpecifically, result provides the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for circular orbits (e=0):\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_star + M_p)^(2/3)\n\nThe problem states M_p is similar to Neptune and M_star is similar to the Sun. M_Neptune is about 17 times M_Earth, and M_Sun is about 333,000 times M_Earth. So, M_p << M_star, and the approximation (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star is valid.\n\nThe formula becomes:\nK ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)\n\nThis confirms that K is proportional to P^(-1/3), assuming all other factors are constant between the two systems.\n\nThe problem states:\n- M_star1 = M_star2 (given)\n- m_p1 ≈ m_p2 (given as \"similar masses\")\n- The RV method measures M_p * sin(i), so the most reasonable interpretation is that M_p1*sin(i1) ≈ M_p2*sin(i2).\n\nThe wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity (K).\n\nTherefore, the logic holds:\n1.  K is proportional to Δλ.\n    K2 / K1 = Δλ2 / Δλ1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n2.  K is proportional to P^(-1/3).\n    K2 / K1 = (P2 / P1)^(-1/3) = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)\n3.  Equating the two expressions for K2 / K1:\n    1.4 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)\n4.  Solving for P2 / P1:\n    (1.4)³ = P1 / P2\n    2.744 = P1 / P2\n    P2 / P1 = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe result is robust.

The key is to correctly identify the relationship K ∝ P^(-1/3) and to make the standard assumption that \"similar masses\" in an RV context refers to the observable quantity `m_p * sin(i)`.\n\nThe calculation is complete and verified. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\n1.  **State the relationship between wavelength shift and radial velocity amplitude.** The amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is directly proportional to the observed periodic wavelength shift (Δλ).\n2.  **Calculate the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes.** K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7/5 = 1.4.\n3.  **State the formula for the radial velocity amplitude.** For a planet in a circular orbit, K is proportional to M_p*sin(i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)).\n4.  **Apply the given conditions.** The stars have the same mass (M₁ = M₂), and the planets have similar masses (implying m_p₁*sin(i₁) ≈ m_p₂*sin(i₂)).\n5.  **Simplify the relationship.** Under these conditions, K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3).\n6.  **Set up the equation.** K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3).\n7.  **Solve for the period ratio.**\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n    (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644.\n8.  **Compare with the options.** The calculated value of ~0.36 matches option C.\n\nThe reasoning is sound. I will now write the final response.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to relate the observed periodic wavelength shift to the orbital period of the exoplanet using the principles of the Radial Velocity (RV) method.\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The periodic shift in the spectral line's wavelength (Δλ) is caused by the Doppler effect due to the star's motion along our line of sight. This motion is induced by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The amplitude of the star's radial velocity (denoted as K) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Formula:** The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) for a star with an orbiting planet is given by the formula:\n    K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\n    This formula applies under the given conditions: circular orbits (eccentricity e=0) and a planet mass (m_p) much smaller than the star's mass (M_star). Here, P is the orbital period, G is the gravitational constant, m_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and i is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Applying the Given Information:** We are given that:\n    *   The stars have identical masses: M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂. In the context of the RV method, the measured quantity is the minimum mass, m_p * sin(i). The problem's phrasing implies that this value is similar for both planets, so we can assume m_p₁ * sin(i₁) ≈ m_p₂ * sin(i₂).\n\n4.  **Finding the Relationship between K and P:** Since M_star and m_p * sin(i) are the same for both systems, the formula simplifies to show that the radial velocity amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period P:\n    K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** We can now set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We already calculated that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. Substituting this value:\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. We find this by taking the reciprocal:\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36. Comparing this to the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the gravitational pull they exert on their host star. This pull causes the star to \"wobble,\" moving towards and away from us. This movement induces a periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:** The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight. The maximum measured wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, known as the velocity amplitude (K).\n    *   Δλ ∝ K\n\n3.  **The Velocity Amplitude Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0), the velocity amplitude K is given by:\n    *   K = ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\n    Where:\n        *   P is the orbital period of the planet.\n        *   m_p is the mass of the planet.\n        *   M_star is the mass of the star.\n        *   G is the gravitational constant.\n        *   i is the inclination of the orbit.\n\n4.  **Apply the Given Information:** The problem states that for both systems:\n    *   The mass of the stars are the same (M_star1 = M_star2).\n    *   The mass of the planets are the same (m_p1 = m_p2).\n    *   We can assume the orbital inclinations (i) are comparable, as is standard in such problems unless stated otherwise.\n\n    Therefore, the term `(m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))` is a constant for both planets. This simplifies the relationship between the velocity amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P) to:\n    *   K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n5.  **Establish the Ratio:** Since the wavelength shift (Δλ) is proportional to K, we can also say:\n    *   Δλ ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n    We can now write a ratio for the two planets:\n    *   (Δλ₂ / Δλ₁) = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n6.  **Substitute the Values and Solve:** We are given:\n    *   Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n    *   Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n\n    Substituting these into the ratio:\n    *   (7 / 5) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   (7 / 5)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    *   343 / 125 = P₁ / P₂\n    *   2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n7.  **Find the Final Answer:** The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. We take the reciprocal of the previous result:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 = 125 / 343\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it is significantly shorter. This aligns with the initial data, as a larger Doppler shift (planet #2) implies a larger stellar velocity, which in turn is caused by a planet in a closer, shorter-period orbit.\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.36 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe reasoning and calculation are as follows:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The radial velocity (RV) amplitude, K, is directly proportional to the observed periodic wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$.\n    *   $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$\n    *   For planet #1, $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom.\n    *   For planet #2, $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom.\n    *   The ratio of the RV amplitudes is $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (T):** The formula for the RV amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    where T is the orbital period, $m_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, and i is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Establish Proportionality:** The problem states that the star masses are the same ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the planet masses are the same ($m_{p1} = m_{p2}$). We also assume the orbital inclinations are the same ($i_1 = i_2$), as is standard when this information is not provided.

The amplitude of the observed radial velocity, known as the semi-amplitude (K), is therefore proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n    Given the periodic shifts for the two planets' host stars:\n    *   Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n    *   Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n\n    The ratio of their radial velocity semi-amplitudes is:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula:** The semi-amplitude (K) of the star's radial velocity is determined by the properties of the star-planet system. For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula is:\n    *   K = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\n    where:\n        *   T is the orbital period.\n        *   m_p is the mass of the planet.\n        *   M_star is the mass of the star.\n        *   i is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n        *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Applying the Given Information:** The problem provides the following crucial details:\n    *   The stars have \"exactly the same masses\": M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n    *   The planets were detected using the RV method and have \"masses similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of RV discoveries, the measurable quantity is the minimum mass, m_p * sin(i), not the true mass m_p, as the inclination *i* is generally unknown. Therefore, it is standard to assume that the measured minimum masses are what is being referred to as similar.\n    *   (m_p * sin(i))₁ ≈ (m_p * sin(i))₂\n\n4.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** We can now set up a ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two systems:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = [ (2πG / T₂)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i))₂ / (M_star₂^(2/3)) ] / [ (2πG / T₁)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i))₁ / (M_star₁^(2/3)) ]\n\n    Since the stellar masses and the minimum planetary masses are the same, these terms, along with the constants, cancel out, simplifying the equation significantly:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = (1 / T₂^(1/3)) / (1 / T₁^(1/3))\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Solving for the Final Answer:** Substitute the known value of K₂ / K₁ = 1.4 into the simplified equation:\n    *   1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods (T₂ / T₁), we first solve for T₁ / T₂ by cubing both sides:\n    *   T₁ / T₂ = (1.4)³ = 2.744\n\n    Finally, invert the fraction to get the desired ratio:\n    *   T₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity**\n    The periodic shift in a star's spectral line (Δλ) is caused by its motion along our line of sight, an effect known as the Doppler shift. The magnitude of this shift is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum measured wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is known as the semi-amplitude, K.\n\n    Therefore, we can establish a ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes for the two stars:\n    K₁ ∝ Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n    K₂ ∝ Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\n    The ratio is K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4.\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude (K) of the host star's radial velocity is given by the formula:\n\n    K = ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i)) / (Mₛ + mₚ)^(2/3)\n\n    Where:\n    *   `P` is the orbital period of the planet.\n    *   `mₚ` is the mass of the planet.\n    *   `Mₛ` is the mass of the star.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n    The term `mₚ sin(i)` is the \"minimum mass\" of the planet, which is the quantity directly measured by the RV method.\n\n3.  **Set up a Ratio for the Two Systems**\n    We can write the expression for K for each of the two star-planet systems:\n\n    K₁ = ( (2πG) / P₁ )^(1/3) * (mₚ₁ sin(i₁)) / (Mₛ₁ + mₚ₁)^(2/3)\n    K₂ = ( (2πG) / P₂ )^(1/3) * (mₚ₂ sin(i₂)) / (Mₛ₂ + mₚ₂)^(2/3)\n\n    Now, we can create a ratio of K₂ to K₁:\n\n    K₂ / K₁ = [ (P₁/P₂)^(1/3) ] * [ (mₚ₂ sin(i₂)) / (mₚ₁ sin(i₁)) ] * [ (Mₛ₁ + mₚ₁)^(2/3) / (Mₛ₂ + mₚ₂)^(2/3) ]\n\n4.  **Apply the Given Information**\n    Let's simplify this ratio using the details from the problem description:\n    *   The stars have \"exactly the same masses\" (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂).\n    *   The planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune\" and the stars have masses \"similar to that of our Sun\". This means the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (mₚ << Mₛ). Therefore, we can approximate (Mₛ + mₚ) ≈ Mₛ. With Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂, this term cancels out.\n    *   The planets were detected using the RV method and both have \"masses similar to that of Neptune\". In the context of RV discoveries, this implies that their measured minimum masses (`mₚ sin(i)`) are similar. Thus, (mₚ₂ sin(i₂)) / (mₚ₁ sin(i₁)) ≈ 1.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Period Ratio**\n    Substituting these simplifications into the ratio equation, we get:\n\n    K₂ / K₁ ≈ (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We already found that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. So:\n\n    1.4 ≈ (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods (P₂ / P₁), we first cube both sides:\n\n    (1.4)³ ≈ P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 ≈ P₁ / P₂\n\n    Now, we invert the expression to find the desired ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1:\n\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ 1 / 2.744\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    The calculated ratio is approximately 0.36. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
