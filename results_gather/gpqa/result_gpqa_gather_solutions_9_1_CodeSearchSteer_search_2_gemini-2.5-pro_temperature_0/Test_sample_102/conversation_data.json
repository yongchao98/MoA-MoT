Acetyl group (-COCH3) at C1\n    2.  Bromo group (-Br) at C3\n    3.  Nitro group (-NO2) at C5\n\nAll three substituents are *meta* to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Electron-withdrawing, deactivating, and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Electron-withdrawing (by induction) but lone pairs can donate via resonance, overall deactivating, and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly electron-withdrawing, deactivating, and a *meta*-director.\n\nA 1,3,5-substitution pattern is most easily achieved when the directing effects of the substituents on the ring cooperate. Let's evaluate the proposed reaction sequences.\n\n### Analysis of the Options\n\n**A) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n\n1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction forms acetophenone (C6H5COCH3). The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    *Product:* Acetophenone.\n\n2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 (Bromination):** The acetyl group directs the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the *meta* position.\n    *Product:* 3-Bromoacetophenone.\n\n3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** Now the ring has two substituents: an acetyl group at C1 (*meta*-director) and a bromo group at C3 (*ortho, para*-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to C5.\n    *   The -Br group directs the incoming nitro group to C2, C4, and C6.\n    The directing effects are in conflict. However, we must consider the stability of the reaction intermediates (Wheland intermediates or sigma complexes).\n    *   Attack at C2, C4, or C6 (the positions directed by bromine) would place a partial positive charge on C1 in one of the resonance structures. This is highly destabilized by the adjacent electron-withdrawing carbonyl group.\n    *   Attack at C5 (the position directed by the acetyl group) results in an intermediate where the positive charge is never placed on C1. This intermediate is significantly more stable.\n    Therefore, the nitration will occur predominantly at the C5 position, yielding the desired product.\n    *Product:* 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe first three steps of this sequence successfully and with high yield produce the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical as they would modify the final product. It is highly likely that these extra steps are an error in the question's options. However, since the initial three steps provide a valid and high-yield route to the product, and the other options are fundamentally flawed, this is the most plausible choice.\n\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n\n1.  **i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitrobenzene.**\n2.  **ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl -> Aniline.**\n3.  **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction fails. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex (-NH2+-AlCl3). This makes the ring strongly deactivated, preventing the Friedel-Crafts reaction. Thus, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2; ...**\n\n1.  **i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.**\n2.  **ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.**\n3.  **iii) Aniline -> Benzenediazonium chloride.**\n4.  **iv) Benzenediazonium chloride + H3PO2 -> Benzene.** This sequence of reactions simply converts benzene back into benzene, making it a pointless route.\n\n**D) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n\n1.  **i) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 -> Bromobenzene.**\n2.  **ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Mixture of o- and p-bromonitrobenzene.** Let's proceed with the major para isomer, 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene.\n3.  **iii) 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acylation.** The -Br (o,p-director) and -NO2 (m-director) both direct the incoming acetyl group to the C2 position. This would form 2-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone, which is not the target isomer. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the options, only sequence A provides a chemically sound route to the target molecule in its initial steps. The subsequent steps appear to be erroneous additions. Given the choices, option A is the only one that contains a correct synthetic pathway to 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we need to analyze the directing effects of the substituents and the conditions for each reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule:**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Plan the Synthesis by Considering the Order of Reactions:**\n\n*   **Path 1: Start with acylation.**\n    i.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    ii. **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one.** Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, bromination occurs at the meta position (position 3).\n    iii. **1-(3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** Now we add the nitro group. The ring has two substituents: -COCH3 (at 1) and -Br (at 3). The -COCH3 group directs *meta* (to position 5). The -Br group directs *ortho* and *para* (to positions 2, 4, 6). The acetyl group is a stronger deactivating group, and its *meta*-directing effect will control the position of the incoming nitro group, placing it at position 5. This route successfully produces the target molecule.\n\n*   **Path 2: Start with nitration.**\n    i.  **Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.** The nitro group is a *meta*-director.\n    ii. **Nitrobenzene + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene.** Bromination occurs at the meta position.\n    iii. **1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → No reaction.** Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings like this one (deactivated by both -NO2 and -Br). This path fails.\n\n*   **Path 3: Start with bromination.**\n    i.  **Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.** The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    ii. **Bromobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → p-bromoacetophenone (major product).** This does not give the required 1,3 substitution pattern needed for the intermediate. This path fails to produce the target in high yield.\n\n**4. Compare with the Options:**\nThe successful synthetic route is: 1. Acylation, 2. Bromination, 3. Nitration. This corresponds to the first three steps of option D.\n\n*   **Option A** fails because Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene is not feasible.\n*   **Option B** fails because Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) on aniline is problematic; the Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic amine group.\n*   **Option C** is illogical as it involves creating aniline and then removing the amine group to go back to benzene.\n*   **Option D** correctly lists the viable sequence of acylation → bromination → nitration as its first three steps. Although it includes additional, unnecessary steps, it is the only option that contains a correct pathway to the desired product.\n\nTherefore, option D describes the correct sequence of reactions.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Parent structure:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The three substituents are all *meta* to each other (1,3,5-substitution).\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order in which substituents are added is critical in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because existing groups on the ring direct new groups to specific positions.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino group):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n**3. Key Reaction Considerations**\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (e.g., CH3COCl/AlCl3):** This reaction does not work on strongly deactivated rings (like nitrobenzene) or on rings with an amino group (-NH2) because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic nitrogen atom.\n*   **Synthesis Strategy for 1,3,5-Trisubstituted Benzene:** A common strategy to create a 1,3,5-pattern is to start by introducing a *meta*-director. This director can then guide the next two substitutions.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Option**\n\n**Option A:**\n*   i) `Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene`: This is correct. The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n*   ii) `Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → p-Bromonitrobenzene` (major product): The *o,p*-directing -Br group places the -NO2 group mainly at the para position.\n*   iii) `p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ?`: This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group. This reaction will fail or give a very low yield. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Option B:**\n*   i) `Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene`: Correct.\n*   ii) `Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline`: Correct reduction.\n*   iii) `Aniline + NaNO2/HCl → Benzenediazonium salt`: Correct diazotization.\n*   iv) `Benzenediazonium salt + H3PO2 → Benzene`: Correct deamination.\n*   This sequence of steps (ii, iii, iv) converts nitrobenzene back to benzene, making the entire process pointless. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\n*   i) `Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene`: Correct.\n*   ii) `Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline`: Correct.\n*   iii) `Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ?`: This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid AlCl3 coordinates with the basic amino group, creating a strongly deactivating -NH3+ type group. This sequence is incorrect. (Even if interpreted as N-acylation followed by other steps, it leads to the wrong isomer).\n\n**Option D:**\n*   i) `Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone`: This Friedel-Crafts acylation is a standard reaction. It correctly installs the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director. This is an excellent first step for achieving a 1,3,5-pattern.\n*   ii) `Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone`: The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (position 3). The structure is now 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one. This is a correct and logical step.\n*   iii) `3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one`: Now we nitrate the ring which has two substituents: -COCH3 (at C1, *meta*-director) and -Br (at C3, *o,p*-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the new group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   The positions ortho to the acetyl group (2 and 6) are strongly deactivated and sterically hindered. The directing effect of the -COCH3 group is dominant in this case. Therefore, the nitro group will add to position 5.\n    *   This step successfully yields the target molecule: **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   iv) - vii): The remaining steps (`Fe/HCl`, `HNO3/H2SO4`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `H3PO2`) are chemically nonsensical in this context. They would reduce the nitro group just added and then eventually remove it, reverting the product to an earlier intermediate. This is very likely an error in the question's options. However, the first three steps constitute a valid and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options, the sequence of reactions in the first three steps of option D is the only chemically sound pathway to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The other options fail due to incorrect regiochemistry or unfeasible reactions. Despite the extraneous later steps listed in option D, it contains the correct synthetic route.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring attached to a -COCH3 group).\n*   The substituents on the phenyl ring are:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents direct incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Devise a Plausible Synthetic Strategy (Retrosynthesis)**\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern is key. This pattern is most easily achieved when two *meta*-directing groups are present on the ring, as they will both direct a third incoming group to the position between them (C5).\n\nLet's consider the order of introducing the three groups.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Introduce the acetyl group last.**\n    *   This would require a Friedel-Crafts acetylation of 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene.\n    *   However, Friedel-Crafts reactions (acetylation and alkylation) fail on strongly deactivated rings. A ring with both a bromo and a nitro group is too deactivated. So, this strategy is not viable for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Introduce the acetyl group first or second.**\n    *   **Path A: Acetylation -> Nitration -> Bromination**\n        1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n        2.  **Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the meta position (C3).\n        3.  **3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** Now, the ring has two *meta*-directors (-COCH3 at C1, -NO2 at C3). Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the C5 position. This sequence is chemically sound and leads directly to the desired product.\n\n    *   **Path B: Acetylation -> Bromination -> Nitration**\n        1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.**\n        2.  **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the bromine to the meta position.\n        3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → ?** Now the ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3).\n            *   The -COCH3 group directs nitration to C5.\n            *   The -Br group directs nitration to C2, C4, and C6.\n            *   The directing effects are in conflict. The *o,p*-directing effect of the halogen is generally stronger than the *m*-directing effect of the acetyl group. Therefore, nitration will predominantly occur at positions ortho and para to the bromine (C4 and C6). The desired 5-nitro isomer would be a very minor product. This path would not be high-yield.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most logical and high-yield synthesis is **Acetylation → Nitration → Bromination**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's check if any of the options match our derived strategies. The options are all 7 steps long, suggesting a more complex route might be intended, possibly to circumvent a low-yield step. However, let's analyze them as written.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4`\n    *   Steps i-iv (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene to benzene, which is nonsensical. The subsequent steps (v-vii) synthesize 1-(4-bromo-3-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which is the wrong isomer.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    *   Step iii is the Friedel-Crafts acetylation of aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    *   Step iii is the Friedel-Crafts acetylation of p-bromonitrobenzene. As discussed in Strategy 1, this reaction fails because the ring is too deactivated.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...`\n    *   This sequence corresponds to Path B (Acetylation → Bromination → Nitration). As analyzed, step iii gives the wrong isomers (4-nitro and 6-nitro) in high yield, not the desired 5-nitro product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are also nonsensical as they would ultimately convert the product of step iii back to 3-bromoacetophenone.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll the provided options are flawed. Options B and C contain steps that are known to fail. Option A is nonsensical and produces the wrong isomer. Option D follows a plausible sequence of reaction types, but fails on the crucial regiochemistry of the nitration step.\n\nHowever, if forced to choose the \"best\" option, one might look for the most likely error in the question's design. The sequence in Option D (Acetylation → Bromination → Nitration) is a very common pattern to test. The failure is in the subtle understanding of competing directing groups. It's possible the question designer overlooked this, assuming a simple \"meta, meta, meta\" addition. Alternatively, and more plausibly, there is a typo, and steps (ii) and (iii) should be swapped. If swapped, the sequence becomes Acetylation → Nitration → Bromination, which is the correct synthesis. Given that the other options have more fundamental and \"hard-fail\" errors, Option D, despite its flaw, represents the most plausible starting point for a correct synthesis.\n\nLet's re-examine the most viable pathway: Acetylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.\n1.  `CH3COCl/AlCl3`: Benzene -> Acetophenone\n2.  `HNO3/H2SO4`: Acetophenone -> 3-Nitroacetophenone\n3.  `Br2/FeBr3`: 3-Nitroacetophenone -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n\nThis correct 3-step synthesis is a permutation of the first three steps of option D. It is the most chemically sound route to the target molecule in high yield. The question is likely flawed, but option D contains the correct reagents in an almost-correct order.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is necessary. The target molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) at positions 1, 3, and 5, respectively. This means all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** This is a strong deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n**Evaluation of Synthetic Routes:**\n\nA high-yield synthesis of a polysubstituted benzene typically requires the directing effects of the substituents to reinforce each other, meaning they direct the incoming group to the same position. Let's analyze the proposed options:\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence is incorrect because it involves the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline, followed by diazotization and then deamination with H3PO2, which would regenerate benzene, making the initial steps pointless.\n*   **Option B:** This sequence begins with the bromination of benzene to form bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The subsequent nitration would yield primarily 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, establishing a 1,4-substitution pattern that cannot lead to the desired 1,3,5-substituted product.\n*   **Option C:** This sequence involves forming acetanilide, then brominating it to get the *para* product (4-bromoacetanilide). Further nitration would occur *ortho* to the activating acetamido group, leading to a 1,2,4-substitution pattern, which is incorrect. Additionally, the sequence incorrectly suggests diazotizing an amide without a prior hydrolysis step.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence begins with two logical steps to form a 1,3-disubstituted benzene:\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene reacts with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and AlCl3 to form acetophenone.\n    2.  **ii) Bromination:** The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, so bromination of acetophenone with Br2/FeBr3 yields 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **iii) Nitration:** The next step is the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. At this stage, the ring has a *meta*-directing acetyl group and an *ortho, para*-directing bromo group. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5, while the bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. This conflict of directing effects would likely lead to a mixture of products, making it not a high-yield pathway for the specific isomer. Furthermore, the subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical as they would modify the already-formed target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion on Options:**\nAll the provided options are flawed either by leading to the wrong isomer, containing chemically incorrect steps, or including nonsensical reaction sequences.\n\n**Optimal Synthetic Route (Theoretical):**\nThe most efficient synthesis for a 1,3,5-trisubstituted product where two substituents are *meta*-directors is to introduce them sequentially to take advantage of reinforcing directing effects.\n1.  **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone (The acetyl group directs *meta*).\n3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. In this step, both the acetyl and nitro groups are *meta*-directors, and both direct the incoming bromine to position 5. This reinforcement should lead to a high yield of the desired product.\n\nSince this optimal route is not an option, and all given options are flawed, we must identify the \"least incorrect\" or most plausible choice. Option D correctly assembles the 1,3-disubstituted intermediate (3-bromoacetophenone) in its first two steps. The third step (nitration) is the only one among all options that could conceivably place the final group at the C-5 position, despite the conflicting directing effects. The remaining steps in option D are clearly erroneous. Given the choices, the initial sequence of Option D is the most plausible starting point for the synthesis, assuming there are significant errors in the question's options.\n\nHowever, based on a strict evaluation, none of the options describe a valid, high-yield synthesis. If a choice must be made, Option D is the only one that correctly establishes the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups before introducing the final nitro group.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nAn analysis of the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene requires a strategic application of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, considering the directing effects of the substituents at each step. The target molecule has three substituents (-COCH3, -Br, -NO2) in a 1,3,5-relationship on the benzene ring.\n\nLet's analyze the directing effects of the groups involved:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Amino group (-NH2):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nThe goal is to introduce these three groups with the correct 1,3,5-regiochemistry in high yield.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   Steps i through iv (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene to nitrobenzene and then back to benzene. This sequence is illogical and incorrect.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director. This is a good first step.\n*   **ii) Bromination:** Acetophenone is brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the bromine to the 3-position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone. This is a high-yield reaction.\n*   **iii) Nitration:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. Now, the ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The -COCH3 group directs nitration to the 5-position, while the -Br group directs to the 2, 4, and 6 positions. These directing effects are in conflict. Such reactions typically lead to a mixture of isomers, including the 3-bromo-4-nitro and 3-bromo-2-nitro products, and thus the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one is not formed in high yield. However, this sequence does produce the target molecule, even if as a minor product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) appear superfluous as the target molecule has already been formed.\n\n**C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Bromination:** Benzene to bromobenzene.\n*   **ii) Nitration:** Bromobenzene is nitrated to give a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-bromonitrobenzene.\n*   **iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Attempting to acylate either *o*- or *p*-bromonitrobenzene would fail or give extremely low yields because the nitro group strongly deactivates the ring towards Friedel-Crafts reactions. This pathway is not viable.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Nitration:** Benzene to nitrobenzene.\n*   **ii) Reduction:** Nitrobenzene to aniline.\n*   **iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction does not work on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a deactivating -NH2-AlCl3 complex, which prevents the desired acylation on the ring. This pathway is not viable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOptions A, C, and D contain steps that are either nonsensical or based on reactions that do not work under the specified conditions. Option B describes a sequence of viable reactions. Although step (iii) would result in a mixture of isomers rather than a high yield of the single desired product due to conflicting directing groups, it is the only pathway among the choices that can form the target molecule. The most efficient synthesis (Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination) is not listed as an option. Among the flawed choices, option B is the most plausible route.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\nThe target molecule is:\n![Image of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one](https://i.imgur.com/9Z8jJ7g.png)\nIt has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at C1\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at C3\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at C5\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* relationship with each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\nLet's evaluate the directing effects of the functional groups involved:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n**A) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director. This is a good first step.\n2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position. This step is correct.\n3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** At this stage, we have the -COCH3 group (m-director) at C1 and the -Br group (o,p-director) at C3. The position C5 is *meta* to the acetyl group. Although the directing effects conflict, the acetyl group's meta-directing influence is strong, and nitration at C5 is the expected outcome. This three-step sequence directly produces the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are unnecessary for the synthesis and would not be performed on the final product, but the initial sequence is chemically sound and the most plausible among the choices.\n\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n1.  **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene**\n2.  **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline**\n3.  **iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride**\n4.  **iv) Benzenediazonium chloride + H3PO2 → Benzene:** This sequence of reactions simply removes the nitro group, returning to the starting material. This is a nonsensical pathway.\n\n**C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n1.  **i) Benzene → Bromobenzene:** The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n2.  **ii) Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product):** This establishes a 1,4-substitution pattern, which is incorrect for the 1,3,5-pattern of the target molecule.\n3.  **iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts acylation fails on strongly deactivated rings like this one, which has both a bromo and a nitro group. This option is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n1.  **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene**\n2.  **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline**\n3.  **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot be performed on anilines because the basic amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring. This makes the sequence incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A is the only one that presents a chemically viable route to the target molecule, specifically in its first three steps. The subsequent steps listed in option A are superfluous and incorrect if applied to the final product, but the initial sequence (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) is the most logical and correct pathway among all choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are **meta** to each other (1,3 and 1,5 and 3,5 relationships).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents on the benzene ring direct new substituents to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating (weakly) and an **ortho-, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Deactivating (strongly) and a **meta-director**.\n\nThe synthesis must introduce these groups in an order that respects these directing effects to achieve the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze the reaction sequence proposed in each option, starting from benzene.\n\n**Option A:**\n*   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction introduces an acetyl group to form **acetophenone**. The acetyl group is a meta-director. This is a good first step.\n    *   Product: Acetophenone (C6H5COCH3)\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 (Bromination):** The acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (position 3).\n    *   Product: 3-Bromoacetophenone.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** The ring now has an acetyl group at C1 (meta-director) and a bromo group at C3 (ortho-, para-director).\n    *   The acetyl group (-COCH3) at C1 directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n    *   The bromo group (-Br) at C3 directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   In cases of conflicting directing effects between a meta-director and an ortho-, para-director, the outcome depends on the specific groups. However, for the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone, the major product is indeed **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. The directing effect of the acetyl group to the 5-position prevails.\n*   **iv) - vii):** The subsequent steps (reduction of the nitro group, another nitration, diazotization, deamination) are chemically illogical following the successful synthesis of the target molecule in step iii. They appear to be erroneous additions to the option.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** The first three steps provide a valid and direct route to the target molecule. Despite the confusing extra steps, this sequence is chemically sound.\n\n**Option B:**\n*   **i) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 (Bromination):** Forms **bromobenzene**. The bromo group is an ortho-, para-director.\n*   **ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** This produces a mixture of o-bromonitrobenzene and p-bromonitrobenzene.\n*   **iii) Product + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** The product from step ii (e.g., p-bromonitrobenzene) has two deactivating groups on the ring (-Br and -NO2). Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings that are strongly deactivated (especially by a nitro group). This step would fail or give an extremely low yield.\n**Conclusion for B:** This sequence is not viable.\n\n**Option C:**\n*   **i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** Forms **nitrobenzene**.\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl (Reduction):** Forms **aniline**.\n*   **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction fails. The amino group (-NH2) of aniline is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation.\n**Conclusion for C:** This sequence is not viable as written.\n\n**Option D:**\n*   **i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** Forms **nitrobenzene**.\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl (Reduction):** Forms **aniline**.\n*   **iii) Aniline + NaNO2/HCl (Diazotization):** Forms a benzenediazonium salt.\n*   **iv) Product + H3PO2 (Deamination):** This reaction replaces the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydrogen atom, converting the molecule back to **benzene**.\n**Conclusion for D:** This sequence is nonsensical as it returns to the starting material.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nComparing the four options, only Option A presents a chemically plausible synthetic route to the target molecule, specifically in its first three steps. The other options contain fatal flaws that make them incorrect. The additional steps in Option A (iv-vii) are extraneous and likely an error in the question's formulation, but the core synthesis (i-iii) is correct. Therefore, Option A is the best answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nThe key feature is the substitution pattern: 1, 3, 5. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nThe presence of the *ortho, para*-directing bromo group in a 1,3,5-substitution pattern suggests that the synthesis is not straightforward and requires careful planning of the reaction order.\n\n**3. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Routes**\n\nThe goal is to add these three groups to a benzene ring. Let's consider the order of addition.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Introduce a *meta*-director first.**\n    *   **Path A: Acylation first.**\n        1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n        2.  Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. Nitration occurs at the *meta* position. This works well.\n        3.  3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Now we brominate. The existing groups are -COCH3 (at C1) and -NO2 (at C3). Both are *meta*-directors. The -COCH3 group directs to C5. The -NO2 group also directs to C5. Their directing effects reinforce each other, leading to the desired product in high yield. This is an excellent synthetic route.\n    *   **Path B: Nitration first.**\n        1.  Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.\n        2.  Nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → No reaction. Friedel-Crafts acylation fails on strongly deactivated rings like nitrobenzene. This path is not viable.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Introduce the *ortho, para*-director first.**\n    *   **Path C: Bromination first.**\n        1.  Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.\n        2.  Bromobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → p-Bromoacetophenone (major product) and o-bromoacetophenone. The -Br group is *o,p*-directing.\n        3.  Nitrating p-bromoacetophenone would not lead to the 1,3,5 pattern. For example, the next substitution would be directed ortho to the bromine and meta to the acetyl group, yielding 1-(4-bromo-2-nitrophenyl)ethanone. This path is incorrect.\n\n*   **Strategy 3: A different order.**\n    *   **Path D: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration.**\n        1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.\n        2.  Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The acetyl group directs bromination to the *meta* position. This works.\n        3.  3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Now we nitrate. We have -COCH3 (meta-director) and -Br (o,p-director). The directing effects are in conflict. However, experimental evidence shows that this reaction does produce the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one as the major product. The deactivating character of both groups favors substitution at C5. So, this route is also viable, though perhaps less efficient than Path A.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nThe options provided are long, 7-step sequences that include reagents for reduction (Fe/HCl) and deamination (NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2). This suggests a more complex synthesis might be intended. However, such complex routes are generally not \"high-yield\" compared to direct methods, and as analyzed in the thought process, they do not lead to the correct product. The options appear to be flawed, containing a valid core synthesis followed by nonsensical additional steps. We must identify the option with the most chemically sound core synthesis.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (product of steps i and ii). This reaction fails or gives very poor yields. So, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    The first three steps correspond exactly to **Path D** (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration), which we determined is a viable, if not optimal, route to the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are irrelevant to the synthesis of the named product.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...\n    The first four steps (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) simply convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and then back to benzene. This is a pointless loop. So, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on p-bromonitrobenzene (the major product of steps i and ii). This ring is strongly deactivated by both the nitro and bromo groups, so the acylation will fail. So, D is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy eliminating the chemically unfeasible options, we are left with Option B. Its initial three steps represent a known, valid synthesis for 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The most logical conclusion is that the question asks to identify this correct core sequence, despite the flawed presentation of the full option.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents and plan their introduction in a logical order.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This is a *meta, meta* substitution pattern, meaning all groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, the groups already on the ring direct where the next group will add.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Synthetic Strategies in the Options**\n\nThe key to achieving the 1,3,5-pattern is to introduce a *meta*-directing group first, which will then guide the subsequent substitutions.\n\n*   **Option A: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ...**\n    *   This sequence starts with the bromination of benzene to form bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. Any subsequent substitution (like nitration in step ii) would lead to a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the required 1,3-disubstitution. This route is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n    *   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene is acylated to form acetophenone. This is an excellent first step because the acetyl group (-COCH3) is a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination.** The acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position. This correctly forms 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration.** The starting material is now 3-bromoacetophenone. It has a *meta*-directing acetyl group at position 1 and an *ortho, para*-directing bromo group at position 3.\n        *   The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n        *   The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n        *   When directing effects conflict, the position that is electronically favored will be the major product. In this case, both groups are deactivating, but the acetyl group's directing effect to position 5 is strongly reinforced because it avoids placing a positive charge in the reaction intermediate next to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group. Therefore, nitration occurs predominantly at position 5, yielding the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   This three-step sequence is a valid, high-yield synthesis. The subsequent steps listed in the option are superfluous, but the core synthetic pathway is correct.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; ...**\n    *   This sequence starts by forming nitrobenzene. The nitro group is strongly deactivating. Friedel-Crafts reactions, such as the acylation in step iii (CH3COCl/AlCl3), do not work on strongly deactivated rings like nitrobenzene. This route is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n    *   This sequence converts benzene to nitrobenzene (i), then to aniline (ii), then to a diazonium salt (iii), and finally back to benzene (iv) through deamination. These first four steps are a futile cycle that accomplishes nothing. This route is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only chemically sound and efficient pathway among the choices is described in the first three steps of option B. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents to build the target molecule with the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1.

Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** A moderately deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A weakly deactivating group and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** A strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern suggests that the synthesis should be planned around the directing effects of the groups, likely by introducing *meta*-directing groups first.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each proposed reaction sequence:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene (Nitration).\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline (Reduction). The -NH2 group is a strong *ortho, para*-director.\n*   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation). This reaction **fails**. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), forming a complex (-NH2+AlCl3-). This makes the ring strongly deactivated and prevents the Friedel-Crafts reaction. Therefore, sequence A is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene (Bromination). The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   ii) Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (Nitration). The para product is major.\n*   iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation). This reaction **fails**. The ring is strongly deactivated by two deactivating groups (-Br and -NO2), preventing the Friedel-Crafts acylation. Therefore, sequence C is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium salt + H3PO2 → Benzene (Deamination). This sequence of steps (i-iv) starts with benzene and ends with benzene. It is an illogical and inefficient pathway. Therefore, sequence D is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) **Benzene → Acetophenone** (Friedel-Crafts Acylation). This is a standard reaction. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n*   ii) **Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone** (Bromination). The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3). This is a correct and efficient step.\n*   iii) **3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** (Nitration). At this stage, the ring has a -COCH3 group at C1 and a -Br group at C3.\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to the other meta position (C5).\n    *   The -Br group directs to the ortho/para positions (C2, C4, C6).\n    *   Although the directing effects conflict, the ring is deactivated by both groups. The positions ortho and para to the strong deactivator (-COCH3) are the most deactivated. The position meta to both groups (C5) is the least deactivated site and is where the substitution will occur. This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n\nThe first three steps of sequence B provide a logical and chemically sound synthesis for the desired product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and would alter the already-formed target molecule, indicating a likely error in the question's formulation. However, since options A, C, and D are fundamentally flawed, sequence B is the only viable choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nAn analysis of the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, reveals a benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2). These groups are in a 1,3,5-relationship, meaning they are all *meta* to each other. Achieving this substitution pattern requires a careful sequence of reactions that considers the directing effects of each group.\n\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group):** A meta-director and deactivating.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** An ortho, para-director and deactivating.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group):** A meta-director and strongly deactivating.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nThis sequence begins with the nitration of benzene to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on aniline. This reaction is not feasible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, strongly deactivating the ring and preventing the desired acylation.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This Friedel-Crafts acylation is a standard method to add the acetyl group to benzene.\n2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group is a meta-director, so it directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position. This step correctly establishes the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** In this step, the ring has two directing groups: the acetyl group at C1 (meta-director) and the bromo group at C3 (ortho, para-director). The acetyl group directs the new substituent to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. While the directing effects are in conflict, this is the most plausible pathway among the choices to form the 1,3,5-substituted product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) appear to be extraneous if the target molecule is formed at this stage, suggesting a possible error in the question's formulation. However, the initial steps of this sequence are the most chemically sound for assembling the required structure.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\nThis sequence is illogical. Steps (i) through (iv) (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) would convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. This circular process makes the option nonsensical.\n\n**D) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nThis sequence starts with bromination of benzene, followed by nitration. This would primarily yield p-bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. The ring is strongly deactivated by both the nitro and bromo groups, causing the Friedel-Crafts acylation to fail.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOptions A, C, and D contain steps that are either chemically impossible (like the Friedel-Crafts reactions in A and D) or nonsensical (the circular sequence in C). Option B provides the most logical and viable route for the first two steps to create the 1,3-disubstituted intermediate. The third step, while having potential issues with regioselectivity, is the only plausible reaction presented in any option that could lead to the final 1,3,5-trisubstituted product. Therefore, it is the best choice among the given options.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n### Re-evaluating the Options\n\nAfter reviewing the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution, a more thorough analysis of the options is possible. The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which has three substituents on a benzene ring at the 1, 3, and 5 positions. This substitution pattern requires careful selection of the reaction sequence to ensure the correct directing effects at each step.\n\n*   **-COCH₃ (acetyl group):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\nLet's re-examine the proposed synthetic routes:\n\n**A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n1.  **Nitration:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n2.  **Reduction:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n3.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Aniline has a basic -NH₂ group that reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring and preventing the acylation reaction. This pathway is not viable.\n\n**B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; v) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; vi) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; vii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**\n1.  **Nitration:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n2.  **Reduction:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n3.  **Diazotization:** Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride.\n4.  **Deamination:** Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene. This sequence of reactions returns to the starting material, making this route inefficient and illogical.\n\n**C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n1.  **Bromination:** Benzene → Bromobenzene. The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n2.  **Nitration:** Bromobenzene → 4-Bromonitrobenzene (major product) and 2-bromonitrobenzene.\n3.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** The presence of a strongly deactivating nitro group on the ring prevents the Friedel-Crafts acylation from occurring. This step would fail, making this route incorrect.\n\n**D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\nLet's analyze this option again, as the first three appear to have fatal flaws.\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n2.  **Bromination:** Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position. This step is effective.\n3.  **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. In this step, the ring has two deactivating groups: the acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1 and the bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   The acetyl group directs incoming groups to the *meta* position (position 5).\n    *   The bromo group directs to the *ortho* and *para* positions (positions 2, 4, and 6).\n    *   When directing groups are in conflict, the position that is least deactivated will be substituted. However, in this specific case, both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. The acetyl group directs *meta* to itself, and the bromo group also directs to position 5, which is *meta* to it. While halogens are typically *o,p*-directors, the strong deactivating nature of the acetyl group reinforces substitution at the 5-position, which is meta to both existing substituents. This leads to the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The subsequent steps listed (iv-vii) are unnecessary as the target molecule has already been formed. The question asks for a sequence that *would lead to* the synthesis, and the first three steps of this option successfully produce the target molecule.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, option D presents the most chemically sound and high-yield pathway to the desired product among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reactions.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order in which substituents are added to the benzene ring is critical. The directing effect of the group(s) already on the ring determines the position of the next incoming group.\n\n*   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl group):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (Bromo group):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (Nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned carefully. A common strategy is to introduce a *meta*-director first to guide subsequent substitutions.\n\n*   **Sequence A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; v) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; vi) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; vii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**\n    *   Steps i through iv (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) constitute a pointless cycle that starts with benzene and ends with benzene. This sequence is illogical.\n\n*   **Sequence B: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   Step i (Bromination) produces bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Step ii (Nitration) would yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This establishes a 1,2 or 1,4-pattern, which cannot lead to the desired 1,3,5-product.\n    *   Furthermore, Step iii (Friedel-Crafts Acylation) would fail because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Sequence C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   Step i (Nitration) and Step ii (Reduction) correctly produce aniline.\n    *   Step iii attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Sequence D: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    *   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone correctly guides the incoming bromine to the C3 position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6. In this case of conflicting directors, substitution at C5 is strongly favored because substitution at the other positions would create a highly unstable reaction intermediate (a carbocation adjacent to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group). Therefore, this step successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe first three steps of sequence D represent a valid, high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The other sequences (A, B, C) contain chemically unfeasible steps or incorrect regiochemistry. The additional steps (iv-vii) listed in option D are superfluous and likely an error in the question's formulation, but the core synthetic route is correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"

The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    *Product:* Acetophenone.\n\n2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 (Bromination):** The acetyl group directs the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the *meta* position.\n    *Product:* 3-Bromoacetophenone.\n\n3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** Now the ring has two substituents: an acetyl group at C1 (*meta*-director) and a bromo group at C3 (*ortho, para*-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to C5.\n    *   The -Br group directs the incoming nitro group to C2, C4, and C6.\n    The directing effects are in conflict. However, we must consider the stability of the reaction intermediates (Wheland intermediates or sigma complexes).\n    *   Attack at C2, C4, or C6 (the positions directed by bromine) would place a partial positive charge on C1 in one of the resonance structures. This is highly destabilized by the adjacent electron-withdrawing carbonyl group.\n    *   Attack at C5 (the position directed by the acetyl group) results in an intermediate where the positive charge is never placed on C1. This intermediate is significantly more stable.\n    Therefore, the nitration will occur predominantly at the C5 position, yielding the desired product.\n    *Product:* 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe first three steps of this sequence successfully and with high yield produce the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical as they would modify the final product. It is highly likely that these extra steps are an error in the question's options. However, since the initial three steps provide a valid and high-yield route to the product, and the other options are fundamentally flawed, this is the most plausible choice.\n\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n\n1.  **i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitrobenzene.**\n2.  **ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl -> Aniline.**\n3.  **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction fails.

This sequence is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the options, only sequence A provides a chemically sound route to the target molecule in its initial steps. The subsequent steps appear to be erroneous additions. Given the choices, option A is the only one that contains a correct synthetic pathway to 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we need to analyze the directing effects of the substituents and the conditions for each reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule:**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Plan the Synthesis by Considering the Order of Reactions:**\n\n*   **Path 1: Start with acylation.**\n    i.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    ii. **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one.** Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, bromination occurs at the meta position (position 3).\n    iii. **1-(3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** Now we add the nitro group. The ring has two substituents: -COCH3 (at 1) and -Br (at 3). The -COCH3 group directs *meta* (to position 5). The -Br group directs *ortho* and *para* (to positions 2, 4, 6). The acetyl group is a stronger deactivating group, and its *meta*-directing effect will control the position of the incoming nitro group, placing it at position 5. This route successfully produces the target molecule.\n\n*   **Path 2: Start with nitration.**\n    i.  **Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.** The nitro group is a *meta*-director.\n    ii. **Nitrobenzene + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene.** Bromination occurs at the meta position.\n    iii. **1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → No reaction.** Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings like this one (deactivated by both -NO2 and -Br). This path fails.\n\n*   **Path 3: Start with bromination.**\n    i.  **Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.** The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    ii. **Bromobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → p-bromoacetophenone (major product).** This does not give the required 1,3 substitution pattern needed for the intermediate. This path fails to produce the target in high yield.\n\n**4. Compare with the Options:**\nThe successful synthetic route is: 1. Acylation, 2. Bromination, 3. Nitration. This corresponds to the first three steps of option D.\n\n*   **Option A** fails because Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene is not feasible.\n*   **Option B** fails because Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) on aniline is problematic; the Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic amine group.\n*   **Option C** is illogical as it involves creating aniline and then removing the amine group to go back to benzene.\n*   **Option D** correctly lists the viable sequence of acylation → bromination → nitration as its first three steps. Although it includes additional, unnecessary steps, it is the only option that contains a correct pathway to the desired product.\n\nTherefore, option D describes the correct sequence of reactions.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Parent structure:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The three substituents are all *meta* to each other (1,3,5-substitution).\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order in which substituents are added is critical in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because existing groups on the ring direct new groups to specific positions.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino group):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n**3. Key Reaction Considerations**\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (e.g., CH3COCl/AlCl3):** This reaction does not work on strongly deactivated rings (like nitrobenzene) or on rings with an amino group (-NH2) because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic nitrogen atom.\n*   **Synthesis Strategy for 1,3,5-Trisubstituted Benzene:** A common strategy to create a 1,3,5-pattern is to start by introducing a *meta*-director. This director can then guide the next two substitutions.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Option**\n\n**Option A:**\n*   i) `Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene`: This is correct. The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n*   ii) `Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → p-Bromonitrobenzene` (major product): The *o,p*-directing -Br group places the -NO2 group mainly at the para position.\n*   iii) `p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ?`: This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group. This reaction will fail or give a very low yield. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Option B:**\n*   i) `Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene`: Correct.\n*   ii) `Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline`: Correct reduction.\n*   iii) `Aniline + NaNO2/HCl → Benzenediazonium salt`: Correct diazotization.\n*   iv) `Benzenediazonium salt + H3PO2 → Benzene`: Correct deamination.\n*   This sequence of steps (ii, iii, iv) converts nitrobenzene back to benzene, making the entire process pointless. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\n*   i) `Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene`: Correct.\n*   ii) `Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline`: Correct.\n*   iii) `Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ?`: This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid AlCl3 coordinates with the basic amino group, creating a strongly deactivating -NH3+ type group. This sequence is incorrect. (Even if interpreted as N-acylation followed by other steps, it leads to the wrong isomer).\n\n**Option D:**\n*   i) `Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone`: This Friedel-Crafts acylation is a standard reaction. It correctly installs the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director. This is an excellent first step for achieving a 1,3,5-pattern.\n*   ii) `Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone`: The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (position 3). The structure is now 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one. This is a correct and logical step.\n*   iii) `3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one`: Now we nitrate the ring which has two substituents: -COCH3 (at C1, *meta*-director) and -Br (at C3, *o,p*-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the new group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   The positions ortho to the acetyl group (2 and 6) are strongly deactivated and sterically hindered. The directing effect of the -COCH3 group is dominant in this case. Therefore, the nitro group will add to position 5.\n    *   This step successfully yields the target molecule: **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   iv) - vii): The remaining steps (`Fe/HCl`, `HNO3/H2SO4`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `H3PO2`) are chemically nonsensical in this context. They would reduce the nitro group just added and then eventually remove it, reverting the product to an earlier intermediate. This is very likely an error in the question's options. However, the first three steps constitute a valid and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options, the sequence of reactions in the first three steps of option D is the only chemically sound pathway to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The other options fail due to incorrect regiochemistry or unfeasible reactions. Despite the extraneous later steps listed in option D, it contains the correct synthetic route.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring attached to a -COCH3 group).\n*   The substituents on the phenyl ring are:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents direct incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Devise a Plausible Synthetic Strategy (Retrosynthesis)**\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern is key. This pattern is most easily achieved when two *meta*-directing groups are present on the ring, as they will both direct a third incoming group to the position between them (C5).\n\nLet's consider the order of introducing the three groups.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Introduce the acetyl group last.**\n    *   This would require a Friedel-Crafts acetylation of 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene.\n    *   However, Friedel-Crafts reactions (acetylation and alkylation) fail on strongly deactivated rings. A ring with both a bromo and a nitro group is too deactivated. So, this strategy is not viable for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Introduce the acetyl group first or second.**\n    *   **Path A: Acetylation -> Nitration -> Bromination**\n        1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n        2.  **Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the meta position (C3).\n        3.  **3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** Now, the ring has two *meta*-directors (-COCH3 at C1, -NO2 at C3). Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the C5 position. This sequence is chemically sound and leads directly to the desired product.\n\n    *   **Path B: Acetylation -> Bromination -> Nitration**\n        1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.**\n        2.  **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the bromine to the meta position.\n        3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → ?** Now the ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3).\n            *   The -COCH3 group directs nitration to C5.\n            *   The -Br group directs nitration to C2, C4, and C6.\n            *   The directing effects are in conflict. The *o,p*-directing effect of the halogen is generally stronger than the *m*-directing effect of the acetyl group. Therefore, nitration will predominantly occur at positions ortho and para to the bromine (C4 and C6). The desired 5-nitro isomer would be a very minor product. This path would not be high-yield.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most logical and high-yield synthesis is **Acetylation → Nitration → Bromination**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's check if any of the options match our derived strategies. The options are all 7 steps long, suggesting a more complex route might be intended, possibly to circumvent a low-yield step. However, let's analyze them as written.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4`\n    *   Steps i-iv (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene to benzene, which is nonsensical. The subsequent steps (v-vii) synthesize 1-(4-bromo-3-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which is the wrong isomer.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    *   Step iii is the Friedel-Crafts acetylation of aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    *   Step iii is the Friedel-Crafts acetylation of p-bromonitrobenzene. As discussed in Strategy 1, this reaction fails because the ring is too deactivated.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...`\n    *   This sequence corresponds to Path B (Acetylation → Bromination → Nitration). As analyzed, step iii gives the wrong isomers (4-nitro and 6-nitro) in high yield, not the desired 5-nitro product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are also nonsensical as they would ultimately convert the product of step iii back to 3-bromoacetophenone.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll the provided options are flawed. Options B and C contain steps that are known to fail. Option A is nonsensical and produces the wrong isomer. Option D follows a plausible sequence of reaction types, but fails on the crucial regiochemistry of the nitration step.\n\nHowever, if forced to choose the \"best\" option, one might look for the most likely error in the question's design. The sequence in Option D (Acetylation → Bromination → Nitration) is a very common pattern to test. The failure is in the subtle understanding of competing directing groups. It's possible the question designer overlooked this, assuming a simple \"meta, meta, meta\" addition. Alternatively, and more plausibly, there is a typo, and steps (ii) and (iii) should be swapped. If swapped, the sequence becomes Acetylation → Nitration → Bromination, which is the correct synthesis. Given that the other options have more fundamental and \"hard-fail\" errors, Option D, despite its flaw, represents the most plausible starting point for a correct synthesis.\n\nLet's re-examine the most viable pathway: Acetylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.\n1.  `CH3COCl/AlCl3`: Benzene -> Acetophenone\n2.  `HNO3/H2SO4`: Acetophenone -> 3-Nitroacetophenone\n3.  `Br2/FeBr3`: 3-Nitroacetophenone -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n\nThis correct 3-step synthesis is a permutation of the first three steps of option D. It is the most chemically sound route to the target molecule in high yield. The question is likely flawed, but option D contains the correct reagents in an almost-correct order.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is necessary. The target molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) at positions 1, 3, and 5, respectively. This means all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** This is a strong deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n**Evaluation of Synthetic Routes:**\n\nA high-yield synthesis of a polysubstituted benzene typically requires the directing effects of the substituents to reinforce each other, meaning they direct the incoming group to the same position. Let's analyze the proposed options:\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence is incorrect because it involves the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline, followed by diazotization and then deamination with H3PO2, which would regenerate benzene, making the initial steps pointless.\n*   **Option B:** This sequence begins with the bromination of benzene to form bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The subsequent nitration would yield primarily 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, establishing a 1,4-substitution pattern that cannot lead to the desired 1,3,5-substituted product.\n*   **Option C:** This sequence involves forming acetanilide, then brominating it to get the *para* product (4-bromoacetanilide). Further nitration would occur *ortho* to the activating acetamido group, leading to a 1,2,4-substitution pattern, which is incorrect. Additionally, the sequence incorrectly suggests diazotizing an amide without a prior hydrolysis step.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence begins with two logical steps to form a 1,3-disubstituted benzene:\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene reacts with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and AlCl3 to form acetophenone.\n    2.  **ii) Bromination:** The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, so bromination of acetophenone with Br2/FeBr3 yields 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **iii) Nitration:** The next step is the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. At this stage, the ring has a *meta*-directing acetyl group and an *ortho, para*-directing bromo group. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5, while the bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. This conflict of directing effects would likely lead to a mixture of products, making it not a high-yield pathway for the specific isomer. Furthermore, the subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical as they would modify the already-formed target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion on Options:**\nAll the provided options are flawed either by leading to the wrong isomer, containing chemically incorrect steps, or including nonsensical reaction sequences.\n\n**Optimal Synthetic Route (Theoretical):**\nThe most efficient synthesis for a 1,3,5-trisubstituted product where two substituents are *meta*-directors is to introduce them sequentially to take advantage of reinforcing directing effects.\n1.  **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone (The acetyl group directs *meta*).\n3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. In this step, both the acetyl and nitro groups are *meta*-directors, and both direct the incoming bromine to position 5. This reinforcement should lead to a high yield of the desired product.\n\nSince this optimal route is not an option, and all given options are flawed, we must identify the \"least incorrect\" or most plausible choice. Option D correctly assembles the 1,3-disubstituted intermediate (3-bromoacetophenone) in its first two steps. The third step (nitration) is the only one among all options that could conceivably place the final group at the C-5 position, despite the conflicting directing effects. The remaining steps in option D are clearly erroneous. Given the choices, the initial sequence of Option D is the most plausible starting point for the synthesis, assuming there are significant errors in the question's options.\n\nHowever, based on a strict evaluation, none of the options describe a valid, high-yield synthesis. If a choice must be made, Option D is the only one that correctly establishes the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups before introducing the final nitro group.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nAn analysis of the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene requires a strategic application of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, considering the directing effects of the substituents at each step. The target molecule has three substituents (-COCH3, -Br, -NO2) in a 1,3,5-relationship on the benzene ring.\n\nLet's analyze the directing effects of the groups involved:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Amino group (-NH2):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nThe goal is to introduce these three groups with the correct 1,3,5-regiochemistry in high yield.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   Steps i through iv (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene to nitrobenzene and then back to benzene. This sequence is illogical and incorrect.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director. This is a good first step.\n*   **ii) Bromination:** Acetophenone is brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the bromine to the 3-position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone. This is a high-yield reaction.\n*   **iii) Nitration:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. Now, the ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The -COCH3 group directs nitration to the 5-position, while the -Br group directs to the 2, 4, and 6 positions. These directing effects are in conflict. Such reactions typically lead to a mixture of isomers, including the 3-bromo-4-nitro and 3-bromo-2-nitro products, and thus the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one is not formed in high yield. However, this sequence does produce the target molecule, even if as a minor product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) appear superfluous as the target molecule has already been formed.\n\n**C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Bromination:** Benzene to bromobenzene.\n*   **ii) Nitration:** Bromobenzene is nitrated to give a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-bromonitrobenzene.\n*   **iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Attempting to acylate either *o*- or *p*-bromonitrobenzene would fail or give extremely low yields because the nitro group strongly deactivates the ring towards Friedel-Crafts reactions. This pathway is not viable.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Nitration:** Benzene to nitrobenzene.\n*   **ii) Reduction:** Nitrobenzene to aniline.\n*   **iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction does not work on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a deactivating -NH2-AlCl3 complex, which prevents the desired acylation on the ring. This pathway is not viable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOptions A, C, and D contain steps that are either nonsensical or based on reactions that do not work under the specified conditions. Option B describes a sequence of viable reactions. Although step (iii) would result in a mixture of isomers rather than a high yield of the single desired product due to conflicting directing groups, it is the only pathway among the choices that can form the target molecule. The most efficient synthesis (Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination) is not listed as an option. Among the flawed choices, option B is the most plausible route.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\nThe target molecule is:\n![Image of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one](https://i.imgur.com/9Z8jJ7g.png)\nIt has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at C1\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at C3\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at C5\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* relationship with each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\nLet's evaluate the directing effects of the functional groups involved:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n**A) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director. This is a good first step.\n2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position. This step is correct.\n3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** At this stage, we have the -COCH3 group (m-director) at C1 and the -Br group (o,p-director) at C3. The position C5 is *meta* to the acetyl group. Although the directing effects conflict, the acetyl group's meta-directing influence is strong, and nitration at C5 is the expected outcome. This three-step sequence directly produces the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are unnecessary for the synthesis and would not be performed on the final product, but the initial sequence is chemically sound and the most plausible among the choices.\n\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n1.  **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene**\n2.  **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline**\n3.  **iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride**\n4.  **iv) Benzenediazonium chloride + H3PO2 → Benzene:** This sequence of reactions simply removes the nitro group, returning to the starting material. This is a nonsensical pathway.\n\n**C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n1.  **i) Benzene → Bromobenzene:** The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n2.  **ii) Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product):** This establishes a 1,4-substitution pattern, which is incorrect for the 1,3,5-pattern of the target molecule.\n3.  **iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts acylation fails on strongly deactivated rings like this one, which has both a bromo and a nitro group. This option is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n1.  **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene**\n2.  **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline**\n3.  **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot be performed on anilines because the basic amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring. This makes the sequence incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A is the only one that presents a chemically viable route to the target molecule, specifically in its first three steps. The subsequent steps listed in option A are superfluous and incorrect if applied to the final product, but the initial sequence (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) is the most logical and correct pathway among all choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are **meta** to each other (1,3 and 1,5 and 3,5 relationships).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents on the benzene ring direct new substituents to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating (weakly) and an **ortho-, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Deactivating (strongly) and a **meta-director**.\n\nThe synthesis must introduce these groups in an order that respects these directing effects to achieve the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze the reaction sequence proposed in each option, starting from benzene.\n\n**Option A:**\n*   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction introduces an acetyl group to form **acetophenone**. The acetyl group is a meta-director. This is a good first step.\n    *   Product: Acetophenone (C6H5COCH3)\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 (Bromination):** The acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (position 3).\n    *   Product: 3-Bromoacetophenone.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** The ring now has an acetyl group at C1 (meta-director) and a bromo group at C3 (ortho-, para-director).\n    *   The acetyl group (-COCH3) at C1 directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n    *   The bromo group (-Br) at C3 directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   In cases of conflicting directing effects between a meta-director and an ortho-, para-director, the outcome depends on the specific groups. However, for the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone, the major product is indeed **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. The directing effect of the acetyl group to the 5-position prevails.\n*   **iv) - vii):** The subsequent steps (reduction of the nitro group, another nitration, diazotization, deamination) are chemically illogical following the successful synthesis of the target molecule in step iii. They appear to be erroneous additions to the option.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** The first three steps provide a valid and direct route to the target molecule. Despite the confusing extra steps, this sequence is chemically sound.\n\n**Option B:**\n*   **i) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 (Bromination):** Forms **bromobenzene**. The bromo group is an ortho-, para-director.\n*   **ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** This produces a mixture of o-bromonitrobenzene and p-bromonitrobenzene.\n*   **iii) Product + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** The product from step ii (e.g., p-bromonitrobenzene) has two deactivating groups on the ring (-Br and -NO2). Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings that are strongly deactivated (especially by a nitro group). This step would fail or give an extremely low yield.\n**Conclusion for B:** This sequence is not viable.\n\n**Option C:**\n*   **i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** Forms **nitrobenzene**.\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl (Reduction):** Forms **aniline**.\n*   **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction fails. The amino group (-NH2) of aniline is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation.\n**Conclusion for C:** This sequence is not viable as written.\n\n**Option D:**\n*   **i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** Forms **nitrobenzene**.\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl (Reduction):** Forms **aniline**.\n*   **iii) Aniline + NaNO2/HCl (Diazotization):** Forms a benzenediazonium salt.\n*   **iv) Product + H3PO2 (Deamination):** This reaction replaces the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydrogen atom, converting the molecule back to **benzene**.\n**Conclusion for D:** This sequence is nonsensical as it returns to the starting material.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nComparing the four options, only Option A presents a chemically plausible synthetic route to the target molecule, specifically in its first three steps. The other options contain fatal flaws that make them incorrect. The additional steps in Option A (iv-vii) are extraneous and likely an error in the question's formulation, but the core synthesis (i-iii) is correct. Therefore, Option A is the best answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nThe key feature is the substitution pattern: 1, 3, 5. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nThe presence of the *ortho, para*-directing bromo group in a 1,3,5-substitution pattern suggests that the synthesis is not straightforward and requires careful planning of the reaction order.\n\n**3. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Routes**\n\nThe goal is to add these three groups to a benzene ring. Let's consider the order of addition.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Introduce a *meta*-director first.**\n    *   **Path A: Acylation first.**\n        1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n        2.  Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. Nitration occurs at the *meta* position. This works well.\n        3.  3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Now we brominate. The existing groups are -COCH3 (at C1) and -NO2 (at C3). Both are *meta*-directors. The -COCH3 group directs to C5. The -NO2 group also directs to C5. Their directing effects reinforce each other, leading to the desired product in high yield. This is an excellent synthetic route.\n    *   **Path B: Nitration first.**\n        1.  Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.\n        2.  Nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → No reaction. Friedel-Crafts acylation fails on strongly deactivated rings like nitrobenzene. This path is not viable.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Introduce the *ortho, para*-director first.**\n    *   **Path C: Bromination first.**\n        1.  Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.\n        2.  Bromobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → p-Bromoacetophenone (major product) and o-bromoacetophenone. The -Br group is *o,p*-directing.\n        3.  Nitrating p-bromoacetophenone would not lead to the 1,3,5 pattern. For example, the next substitution would be directed ortho to the bromine and meta to the acetyl group, yielding 1-(4-bromo-2-nitrophenyl)ethanone. This path is incorrect.\n\n*   **Strategy 3: A different order.**\n    *   **Path D: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration.**\n        1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.\n        2.  Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The acetyl group directs bromination to the *meta* position. This works.\n        3.  3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Now we nitrate. We have -COCH3 (meta-director) and -Br (o,p-director). The directing effects are in conflict. However, experimental evidence shows that this reaction does produce the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one as the major product. The deactivating character of both groups favors substitution at C5. So, this route is also viable, though perhaps less efficient than Path A.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nThe options provided are long, 7-step sequences that include reagents for reduction (Fe/HCl) and deamination (NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2). This suggests a more complex synthesis might be intended. However, such complex routes are generally not \"high-yield\" compared to direct methods, and as analyzed in the thought process, they do not lead to the correct product. The options appear to be flawed, containing a valid core synthesis followed by nonsensical additional steps. We must identify the option with the most chemically sound core synthesis.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (product of steps i and ii). This reaction fails or gives very poor yields. So, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    The first three steps correspond exactly to **Path D** (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration), which we determined is a viable, if not optimal, route to the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are irrelevant to the synthesis of the named product.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...\n    The first four steps (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) simply convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and then back to benzene. This is a pointless loop. So, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on p-bromonitrobenzene (the major product of steps i and ii). This ring is strongly deactivated by both the nitro and bromo groups, so the acylation will fail. So, D is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy eliminating the chemically unfeasible options, we are left with Option B. Its initial three steps represent a known, valid synthesis for 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The most logical conclusion is that the question asks to identify this correct core sequence, despite the flawed presentation of the full option.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents and plan their introduction in a logical order.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This is a *meta, meta* substitution pattern, meaning all groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, the groups already on the ring direct where the next group will add.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Synthetic Strategies in the Options**\n\nThe key to achieving the 1,3,5-pattern is to introduce a *meta*-directing group first, which will then guide the subsequent substitutions.\n\n*   **Option A: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ...**\n    *   This sequence starts with the bromination of benzene to form bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. Any subsequent substitution (like nitration in step ii) would lead to a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the required 1,3-disubstitution. This route is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n    *   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene is acylated to form acetophenone. This is an excellent first step because the acetyl group (-COCH3) is a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination.** The acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position. This correctly forms 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration.** The starting material is now 3-bromoacetophenone. It has a *meta*-directing acetyl group at position 1 and an *ortho, para*-directing bromo group at position 3.\n        *   The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n        *   The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n        *   When directing effects conflict, the position that is electronically favored will be the major product. In this case, both groups are deactivating, but the acetyl group's directing effect to position 5 is strongly reinforced because it avoids placing a positive charge in the reaction intermediate next to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group. Therefore, nitration occurs predominantly at position 5, yielding the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   This three-step sequence is a valid, high-yield synthesis. The subsequent steps listed in the option are superfluous, but the core synthetic pathway is correct.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; ...**\n    *   This sequence starts by forming nitrobenzene. The nitro group is strongly deactivating. Friedel-Crafts reactions, such as the acylation in step iii (CH3COCl/AlCl3), do not work on strongly deactivated rings like nitrobenzene. This route is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n    *   This sequence converts benzene to nitrobenzene (i), then to aniline (ii), then to a diazonium salt (iii), and finally back to benzene (iv) through deamination. These first four steps are a futile cycle that accomplishes nothing. This route is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only chemically sound and efficient pathway among the choices is described in the first three steps of option B. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents to build the target molecule with the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring attached to an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   The benzene ring has three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** A moderately deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A weakly deactivating group and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** A strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern suggests that the synthesis should be planned around the directing effects of the groups, likely by introducing *meta*-directing groups first.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each proposed reaction sequence:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene (Nitration).\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline (Reduction). The -NH2 group is a strong *ortho, para*-director.\n*   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation). This reaction **fails**. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), forming a complex (-NH2+AlCl3-). This makes the ring strongly deactivated and prevents the Friedel-Crafts reaction. Therefore, sequence A is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene (Bromination). The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   ii) Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (Nitration). The para product is major.\n*   iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation). This reaction **fails**. The ring is strongly deactivated by two deactivating groups (-Br and -NO2), preventing the Friedel-Crafts acylation. Therefore, sequence C is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium salt + H3PO2 → Benzene (Deamination). This sequence of steps (i-iv) starts with benzene and ends with benzene. It is an illogical and inefficient pathway. Therefore, sequence D is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) **Benzene → Acetophenone** (Friedel-Crafts Acylation). This is a standard reaction. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n*   ii) **Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone** (Bromination). The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3). This is a correct and efficient step.\n*   iii) **3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** (Nitration). At this stage, the ring has a -COCH3 group at C1 and a -Br group at C3.\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to the other meta position (C5).\n    *   The -Br group directs to the ortho/para positions (C2, C4, C6).\n    *   Although the directing effects conflict, the ring is deactivated by both groups. The positions ortho and para to the strong deactivator (-COCH3) are the most deactivated. The position meta to both groups (C5) is the least deactivated site and is where the substitution will occur. This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n\nThe first three steps of sequence B provide a logical and chemically sound synthesis for the desired product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and would alter the already-formed target molecule, indicating a likely error in the question's formulation. However, since options A, C, and D are fundamentally flawed, sequence B is the only viable choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nAn analysis of the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, reveals a benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2). These groups are in a 1,3,5-relationship, meaning they are all *meta* to each other. Achieving this substitution pattern requires a careful sequence of reactions that considers the directing effects of each group.\n\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group):** A meta-director and deactivating.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** An ortho, para-director and deactivating.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group):** A meta-director and strongly deactivating.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nThis sequence begins with the nitration of benzene to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on aniline. This reaction is not feasible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, strongly deactivating the ring and preventing the desired acylation.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This Friedel-Crafts acylation is a standard method to add the acetyl group to benzene.\n2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group is a meta-director, so it directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position. This step correctly establishes the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** In this step, the ring has two directing groups: the acetyl group at C1 (meta-director) and the bromo group at C3 (ortho, para-director). The acetyl group directs the new substituent to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. While the directing effects are in conflict, this is the most plausible pathway among the choices to form the 1,3,5-substituted product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) appear to be extraneous if the target molecule is formed at this stage, suggesting a possible error in the question's formulation. However, the initial steps of this sequence are the most chemically sound for assembling the required structure.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\nThis sequence is illogical. Steps (i) through (iv) (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) would convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. This circular process makes the option nonsensical.\n\n**D) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nThis sequence starts with bromination of benzene, followed by nitration. This would primarily yield p-bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. The ring is strongly deactivated by both the nitro and bromo groups, causing the Friedel-Crafts acylation to fail.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOptions A, C, and D contain steps that are either chemically impossible (like the Friedel-Crafts reactions in A and D) or nonsensical (the circular sequence in C). Option B provides the most logical and viable route for the first two steps to create the 1,3-disubstituted intermediate. The third step, while having potential issues with regioselectivity, is the only plausible reaction presented in any option that could lead to the final 1,3,5-trisubstituted product. Therefore, it is the best choice among the given options.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n### Re-evaluating the Options\n\nAfter reviewing the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution, a more thorough analysis of the options is possible. The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which has three substituents on a benzene ring at the 1, 3, and 5 positions. This substitution pattern requires careful selection of the reaction sequence to ensure the correct directing effects at each step.\n\n*   **-COCH₃ (acetyl group):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\nLet's re-examine the proposed synthetic routes:\n\n**A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n1.  **Nitration:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n2.  **Reduction:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n3.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Aniline has a basic -NH₂ group that reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring and preventing the acylation reaction. This pathway is not viable.\n\n**B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; v) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; vi) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; vii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**\n1.  **Nitration:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n2.  **Reduction:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n3.  **Diazotization:** Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride.\n4.  **Deamination:** Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene. This sequence of reactions returns to the starting material, making this route inefficient and illogical.\n\n**C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n1.  **Bromination:** Benzene → Bromobenzene. The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n2.  **Nitration:** Bromobenzene → 4-Bromonitrobenzene (major product) and 2-bromonitrobenzene.\n3.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** The presence of a strongly deactivating nitro group on the ring prevents the Friedel-Crafts acylation from occurring. This step would fail, making this route incorrect.\n\n**D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\nLet's analyze this option again, as the first three appear to have fatal flaws.\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n2.  **Bromination:** Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position. This step is effective.\n3.  **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. In this step, the ring has two deactivating groups: the acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1 and the bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   The acetyl group directs incoming groups to the *meta* position (position 5).\n    *   The bromo group directs to the *ortho* and *para* positions (positions 2, 4, and 6).\n    *   When directing groups are in conflict, the position that is least deactivated will be substituted. However, in this specific case, both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. The acetyl group directs *meta* to itself, and the bromo group also directs to position 5, which is *meta* to it. While halogens are typically *o,p*-directors, the strong deactivating nature of the acetyl group reinforces substitution at the 5-position, which is meta to both existing substituents. This leads to the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The subsequent steps listed (iv-vii) are unnecessary as the target molecule has already been formed. The question asks for a sequence that *would lead to* the synthesis, and the first three steps of this option successfully produce the target molecule.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, option D presents the most chemically sound and high-yield pathway to the desired product among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
