This classification is the primary determinant of the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) -NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\nBased on this, we can form two distinct groups. The final order will have all the meta-directors first, followed by all the ortho, para-directors.\nStructure of the correct answer: `{4, 2, 6 in some order} < {1, 5, 3 in some order}`.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para-Yield)**\n\nFor substances 4, 2, and 6, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. The yield of this byproduct is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The -NO₂ group (4) is one of the strongest deactivating groups, leading to the lowest para-yield.\n    *   The -COOH group (6) is a stronger deactivator than the ester group -COOC₂H₅ (2) because the electron-donating ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing effect.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para-Yield)**\n\nFor substances 1, 5, and 3, the para-isomer is a major product. The order of its yield depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect that is distance-dependent. It deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric presence, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. Experimental data shows that the para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (e.g., ~87% in bromination) is typically higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the orders from Step 2 and Step 3, we get the final arrangement from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Underlying Principles**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of their para-monobromo derivative. Since the molar mass of all monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer is determined by the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\nWe must classify each substituent as either an ortho,para-director or a meta-director. This initial classification separates the compounds into two distinct groups: those with high para-yield and those with very low para-yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (Low para-yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is only a minor byproduct.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho,para-directing groups (High para-yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nFrom this classification, we know the final order will be: {4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Group (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these compounds, the para-yield is very low. The yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group; a stronger deactivator is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower para-yield.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (-C₂H₅) partially counteracts the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho,Para-Directing Group (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these compounds, the para-yield is high. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho product, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Consequently, ethylbenzene has a higher para-yield than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is deactivating but strongly para-directing. This is due to a combination of its size and a strong, distance-dependent inductive (-I) effect that deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. Experimental data shows that the para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (around 87-90%) is typically higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho,para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Order of ortho,para-directors: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThe complete sequence for increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal and the Reaction**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-monobromo derivative. Since the molar mass of all monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) is the same for a given starting material, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\nThe directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring is the key factor. We can classify the substituents into two main categories:\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitro group)\n    *   6) C6H5-COOH (Carboxylic acid group)\n    *   2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ester group)\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C6H5-CH3 (Methyl group)\n    *   5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethyl group)\n    *   3) C6H5-Cl (Chloro group)\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final order will have the meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) first, followed by the ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3).\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n*   The order for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield depends on the ratio of para to ortho product, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible, leading to a higher yield of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene compared to toluene. So, the order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is an ortho, para-director but is deactivating. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric hindrance, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (~87%) is typically higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   The order of increasing para-yield for this group is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n*   The order for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**5. Combine the Orders and Select the Final Answer**\nCombining the two ordered groups gives the final sequence:\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\nThe complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option B.\n\n```python\ndef find_correct_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the correct order based on chemical principles\n    and compares it with the given options.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the substances and their properties.\n    # The 'para_yield_rank' is a qualitative ranking based on chemical principles.\n    # A lower rank means a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n    # Meta-directors have the lowest ranks.\n    # Ortho,para-directors have higher ranks.\n    substances = {\n        1: {'group': '-CH3', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'para_yield_rank': 4}, # Base o,p-director\n        2: {'group': '-COOC2H5', 'type': 'm-director', 'para_yield_rank': 3}, # Weakest m-director\n        3: {'group': '-Cl', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'para_yield_rank': 6}, # Highest para yield due to electronics\n        4: {'group': '-NO2', 'type': 'm-director', 'para_yield_rank': 1}, # Strongest m-director\n        5: {'group': '-C2H5', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'para_yield_rank': 5}, # More steric hindrance than -CH3\n        6: {'group': '-COOH', 'type': 'm-director', 'para_yield_rank': 2}  # Stronger m-director than ester\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Sort the substances based on their para-yield rank.\n    sorted_substances = sorted(substances.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]['para_yield_rank'])\n\n    # Step 3: Extract the numbers to form the final ordered sequence.\n    final_order_numbers = [item[0] for item in sorted_substances]\n    final_order_string = '<'.join(map(str, final_order_numbers))\n\n    # Step 4: Define the given options.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"4<2<6<3<1<5\",\n        \"B\": \"4<6<2<1<5<3\",\n        \"C\": \"3<5<1<6<2<4\",\n        \"D\": \"6<2<4<5<1<3\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 5: Find which option matches the derived order.\n    correct_option = None\n    for option, value in options.items():\n        if value == final_order_string:\n            correct_option = option\n            break\n\n    print(\"Based on the analysis of substituent effects (directing effect and steric hindrance):\")\n    print(\"1.

Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe substituent on the benzene ring determines where the incoming bromine electrophile will attach. We can classify the substituents into two main groups:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH₃ (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but still an ortho, para-director.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) -NO₂ (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating group.\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid): Deactivating group.\n    *   2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating group.\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final order will have the meta-directing compounds (4, 6, 2) first, followed by the ortho, para-directing compounds (1, 5, 3).\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The -NO₂ group is one of the strongest deactivators.\n    *   The -COOH group is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The -COOC₂H₅ group is slightly less deactivating than -COOH because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine. Therefore, ethylbenzene will have a higher percentage yield of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is an ortho, para-director but is deactivating. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its own steric hindrance, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene is typically very high (around 87-90%), which is higher than that for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Orders**\nNow, we combine the two ordered groups. The meta-directors have the lowest para-yields, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n*   Order of meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: 1 < 5 < 3\n*   The final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe first step is to classify each substituent on the benzene ring as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This classification is the primary determinant of the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) `-CH₃` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `-C₂H₅` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) `-NO₂` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   2) `-COOC₂H₅` (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\nThis initial grouping tells us that the final sequence must have the meta-directors (4, 2, 6) at the beginning (lowest yield) and the ortho, para-directors (1, 5, 3) at the end (highest yield).\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (Substances 4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: `-NO₂` > `-COOH` > `-COOC₂H₅`.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO₂`) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (`-COOC₂H₅`) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) partially counteracts the electron withdrawal.\n\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength.\n*   **Order of increasing para-yield: 4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Substances 1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** Both have activating alkyl groups. The primary difference is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased bulk hinders attack at the ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   **Order: 1 < 5**\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (`-Cl`) is deactivating but directs ortho, para. It has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect, which is strongest at the nearby ortho positions. This electronic effect, combined with its steric size, strongly favors substitution at the para position. In many electrophilic substitutions, halogens give a very high para/ortho ratio, often higher than that of simple alkylbenzenes.\n    *   **Order: 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Meta-directors order: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Ortho, para-directors order: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe first step is to classify each substituent on the benzene ring as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This classification is the primary determinant of the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. They are all deactivating groups and will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significantly higher yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final sequence must have the meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) at the beginning (lowest yield) and the ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) at the end (highest yield).\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n1.  **-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene, 4):** The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. It will produce the lowest yield of the para-isomer.\n2.  **-COOH (Benzoic acid, 6):** The carboxylic acid group is also strongly deactivating, but less so than the nitro group.\n3.  **-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** The ester group is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid group because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (-C₂H₅) slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing power of the carbonyl.\n\nTherefore, the order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\nThe order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by both steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n1.  **-CH₃ (Toluene, 1):** The methyl group is relatively small, allowing for significant substitution at both ortho and para positions. It has the lowest para-to-ortho ratio in this group.\n2.  **-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene, 5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible, leading to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n3.  **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** The chloro group is highly para-directing. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high yield of the para-isomer, typically higher than for simple alkylbenzenes like toluene and ethylbenzene.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the meta-directors before the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction, a careful step-by-step analysis is required.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe first step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring. This determines whether the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) is directed to the meta position or the ortho and para positions.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups are electron-withdrawing and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. As a result, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They produce a significantly higher yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification allows us to separate the substances into two distinct groups. The final sequence will have the meta-directors first (lowest para-yield), followed by the ortho, para-directors (highest para-yield).\n**Order:** {4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group partially offsets the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength.\n    *   **Order:** 4 < 6 < 2\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This ratio is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** Both have activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Consequently, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   **Order:** 1 < 5\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is deactivating but directs ortho, para. It has a strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) that deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   **Order:** 1 < 5 < 3\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the ordered subgroups, we get the final arrangement from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe first step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This allows us to separate the substances into two main groups: those that will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer and those that will produce a high yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene): The -NO₂ group is strongly deactivating and meta-directing.\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid): The -COOH group is deactivating and meta-directing.\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate): The -COOC₂H₅ group is deactivating and meta-directing.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. These substances will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene): The -CH₃ group is activating and ortho, para-directing.\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene): The -C₂H₅ group is activating and ortho, para-directing.\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene): The -Cl group is deactivating but is ortho, para-directing.\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final order must have substances {2, 4, 6} at the beginning (lowest para yield) and substances {1, 3, 5} at the end (highest para yield).\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. The yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group partially offsets the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the ortho positions, making the less-crowded para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) will have a higher para-isomer yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is highly electronegative and exerts a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect. This effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric considerations, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically very high (around 87-90%), which is generally greater than that for alkylbenzenes like toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the ordered subgroups, we place the meta-directors before the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThe complete sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Final Order with the Given Options**\n\nLet's compare our derived sequence with the options provided:\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nC) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThe calculated order `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3` perfectly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molar mass of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first and most important step is to classify the substituents on the benzene ring as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing. This will separate the substances into two distinct groups: those that produce a high yield of the para-isomer and those that produce a very low yield.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final order must have the meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) at the beginning (lowest yield) and the ortho,para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) at the end (highest yield).\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directing Group (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   The `-NO2` group is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The `-COOH` group is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The `-COOC2H5` group is slightly less deactivating than `-COOH` because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (`-C2H5`) slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing `-CH3` (1) and `-C2H5` (5):** The ethyl group is sterically bulkier than the methyl group. This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with `-Cl` (3):** The chlorine atom is highly para-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric effects, leads to a very high yield of the para-isomer (typically ~87-90%), which is generally higher than for alkylbenzenes.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**5. Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nWe now combine the two ordered groups, with the meta-directors coming before the ortho,para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho,para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents and Their Directing Effects**\n\nThe first step is to classify each substituent on the benzene ring based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This will allow us to separate the substances into two main groups: those that produce a high yield of the para-isomer and those that produce a very low yield.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They will have a relatively high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but still directs ortho, para.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct, so its yield will be the lowest.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final order will have the meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) at the beginning (lowest yield) and the ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) at the end (highest yield).\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nFor substances 4, 6, and 2, the para-isomer yield is very low. The order among them is determined by the strength of the deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group slightly reduces the overall electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength.\n*   The order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nFor substances 1, 5, and 3, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Therefore, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is highly para-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its own steric size, leads to a very high yield of the para-isomer (typically ~87-90%), which is generally higher than that for alkylbenzenes like toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Meta-directors order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho, para-directors order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n*   Combined Final Order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Underlying Principles**\nThe question asks to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molar mass of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar percentage yield. Therefore, we need to rank the substances by the percentage yield of the para-product.\n\nThis yield is determined by the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\nWe must classify each substituent as either an ortho,para-director or a meta-director.\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but directs ortho,para.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.

The final order must have the meta-directors first (lowest para-yield), followed by the ortho,para-directors (highest para-yield).\nThe correct order must follow the pattern: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   The `-NO2` group is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The `-COOH` group is a stronger deactivator than the `-COOC2H5` (ester) group because the electron-donating alkyl part of the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing effect.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength.\n*   The order of increasing para-yield is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased bulk hinders attack at the ortho positions, making the para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (`-Cl`) is deactivating but strongly para-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (typically ~87-89%) is higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nWe combine the two ordered groups, with the meta-directors coming before the ortho,para-directors.\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho,para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Underlying Principles**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-bromo derivative. Since the molar mass of all monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe key principles governing the outcome are the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors** guide the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a high yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **Meta-directors** guide the electrophile to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\nWe first classify the substituent for each substance:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:**\n    *   1) -CH₃ (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but directs ortho, para.\n*   **Meta-directors:**\n    *   4) -NO₂ (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating group.\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid): Deactivating group.\n    *   2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating group.\n\n**Step 3: Initial Grouping**\nBased on the classification, we can form two distinct groups. The meta-directors will have the lowest para-yields, and the ortho, para-directors will have the highest.\n*   **Low para-yield group:** {4, 6, 2}\n*   **High para-yield group:** {1, 5, 3}\nThe final sequence will be of the form: (Order of 4, 6, 2) < (Order of 1, 5, 3).\n\n**Step 4: Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para-Yield Group)**\nFor meta-directors, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The yield of this minor product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, leading to an even smaller percentage of the para-product.\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The -NO₂ group is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n    *   The -COOH group is strongly deactivating.\n    *   The -COOC₂H₅ group is slightly less deactivating than -COOH because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (-C₂H₅) partially counteracts the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 5: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para-Yield Group)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary difference is steric bulk. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is larger than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is highly para-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric considerations, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-yield for chlorobenzene (~87-90%) is typically higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nWe now combine the two ordered groups, with the meta-directors coming before the ortho, para-directors.\n*   Order of meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: 1 < 5 < 3\n*   Combined final order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to:\nNitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n\n**Step 7: Match with the Provided Options**\nThe derived order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.

This classification is the primary determinant of the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low para-yield):** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming bromine to the meta position.

A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   The -NO₂ group is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n*   The -COOH group is strongly deactivating.\n*   The -COOC₂H₅ (ester) group is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating nature of the ethyl group (-C₂H₅) partially offsets the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors**\nFor the ortho, para-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chlorine atom is an ortho, para-director but is deactivating overall. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric considerations, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene is typically very high (around 87-90%), which is greater than that for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the meta-directors before the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents and Group the Substances**\nThe first step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This allows us to separate the substances into two main groups: those that will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer and those that will produce a high yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These are deactivating groups that direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   *Conclusion*: Substances 4, 6, and 2 will have the lowest para-yields and will come first in the sequence.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product for these substances.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n    *   *Conclusion*: Substances 1, 5, and 3 will have the highest para-yields and will come last in the sequence.\n\nThe final order will have the structure: `{4, 6, 2 in some order} < {1, 5, 3 in some order}`.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Group (Lowest Para-Yield)**\nFor the meta-directors, the small amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group slightly reduces the overall electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group (Highest Para-Yield)**\nFor this group, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by both steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary difference is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size blocks the ortho positions more effectively, making the para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is highly para-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (~87-90%) is typically higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents and Group the Substances**\n\nThe first step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This allows us to separate the substances into two main groups: those that will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer and those that will produce a high yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directing Groups (Low Para-Yield):** These substituents are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position.

A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n1.  The order of deactivating strength is generally accepted as: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n2.  The -NO₂ group is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n3.  The -COOH group is also strongly deactivating.\n4.  The -COOC₂H₅ (ester) group is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (-C₂H₅) partially counteracts the electron withdrawal.\n5.  Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength.\n\nThe resulting order is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, the yield of the para-isomer is high, and the order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by both steric and electronic factors.\n\n1.  **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary factor is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more likely site for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n2.  **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is deactivating overall but is an ortho, para-director.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first and most crucial step is to classify the substituents on the benzene ring. This determines whether the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) is directed primarily to the meta position or to the ortho and para positions. This classification separates the substances into two distinct groups based on their expected para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.

The correct answer must have the structure: `{4, 6, 2 in some order} < {1, 5, 3 in some order}`.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a very minor product.

The final order will have all the meta-directors first, followed by all the ortho, para-directors.\nStructure of the correct answer: `{4, 2, 6 in some order} < {1, 5, 3 in some order}`.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para-Yield)**\n\nFor substances 4, 2, and 6, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. The yield of this byproduct is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The -NO₂ group (4) is one of the strongest deactivating groups, leading to the lowest para-yield.\n    *   The -COOH group (6) is a stronger deactivator than the ester group -COOC₂H₅ (2) because the electron-donating ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing effect.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para-Yield)**\n\nFor substances 1, 5, and 3, the para-isomer is a major product. The order of its yield depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect that is distance-dependent. It deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric presence, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. Experimental data shows that the para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (e.g., ~87% in bromination) is typically higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the orders from Step 2 and Step 3, we get the final arrangement from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Underlying Principles**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of their para-monobromo derivative. Since the molar mass of all monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer is determined by the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\nWe must classify each substituent as either an ortho,para-director or a meta-director. This initial classification separates the compounds into two distinct groups: those with high para-yield and those with very low para-yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (Low para-yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position.

The yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group; a stronger deactivator is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower para-yield.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (-C₂H₅) partially counteracts the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho,Para-Directing Group (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these compounds, the para-yield is high. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho product, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Consequently, ethylbenzene has a higher para-yield than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is deactivating but strongly para-directing. This is due to a combination of its size and a strong, distance-dependent inductive (-I) effect that deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. Experimental data shows that the para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (around 87-90%) is typically higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho,para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Order of ortho,para-directors: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThe complete sequence for increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal and the Reaction**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-monobromo derivative. Since the molar mass of all monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) is the same for a given starting material, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\nThe directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring is the key factor. We can classify the substituents into two main categories:\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitro group)\n    *   6) C6H5-COOH (Carboxylic acid group)\n    *   2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ester group)\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C6H5-CH3 (Methyl group)\n    *   5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethyl group)\n    *   3) C6H5-Cl (Chloro group)\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final order will have the meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) first, followed by the ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3).\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n*   The order for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield depends on the ratio of para to ortho product, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible, leading to a higher yield of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene compared to toluene. So, the order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is an ortho, para-director but is deactivating. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric hindrance, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (~87%) is typically higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   The order of increasing para-yield for this group is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n*   The order for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**5.

This order matches option B.\nThe final answer is B.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct order.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe substituent on the benzene ring determines where the incoming bromine electrophile will attach. We can classify the substituents into two main groups:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH₃ (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but still an ortho, para-director.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) -NO₂ (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating group.\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid): Deactivating group.\n    *   2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating group.\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final order will have the meta-directing compounds (4, 6, 2) first, followed by the ortho, para-directing compounds (1, 5, 3).\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The -NO₂ group is one of the strongest deactivators.\n    *   The -COOH group is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The -COOC₂H₅ group is slightly less deactivating than -COOH because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine. Therefore, ethylbenzene will have a higher percentage yield of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is an ortho, para-director but is deactivating. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its own steric hindrance, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene is typically very high (around 87-90%), which is higher than that for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Orders**\nNow, we combine the two ordered groups. The meta-directors have the lowest para-yields, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n*   Order of meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: 1 < 5 < 3\n*   The final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe first step is to classify each substituent on the benzene ring as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This classification is the primary determinant of the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) `-CH₃` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `-C₂H₅` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) `-NO₂` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   2) `-COOC₂H₅` (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\nThis initial grouping tells us that the final sequence must have the meta-directors (4, 2, 6) at the beginning (lowest yield) and the ortho, para-directors (1, 5, 3) at the end (highest yield).\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (Substances 4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: `-NO₂` > `-COOH` > `-COOC₂H₅`.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO₂`) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (`-COOC₂H₅`) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) partially counteracts the electron withdrawal.\n\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength.\n*   **Order of increasing para-yield: 4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Substances 1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** Both have activating alkyl groups. The primary difference is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased bulk hinders attack at the ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   **Order: 1 < 5**\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (`-Cl`) is deactivating but directs ortho, para. It has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect, which is strongest at the nearby ortho positions. This electronic effect, combined with its steric size, strongly favors substitution at the para position. In many electrophilic substitutions, halogens give a very high para/ortho ratio, often higher than that of simple alkylbenzenes.\n    *   **Order: 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Meta-directors order: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Ortho, para-directors order: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe first step is to classify each substituent on the benzene ring as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This classification is the primary determinant of the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. They are all deactivating groups and will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significantly higher yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final sequence must have the meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) at the beginning (lowest yield) and the ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) at the end (highest yield).\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n1.  **-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene, 4):** The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. It will produce the lowest yield of the para-isomer.\n2.  **-COOH (Benzoic acid, 6):** The carboxylic acid group is also strongly deactivating, but less so than the nitro group.\n3.  **-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** The ester group is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid group because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (-C₂H₅) slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing power of the carbonyl.\n\nTherefore, the order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\nThe order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by both steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n1.  **-CH₃ (Toluene, 1):** The methyl group is relatively small, allowing for significant substitution at both ortho and para positions. It has the lowest para-to-ortho ratio in this group.\n2.  **-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene, 5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible, leading to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n3.  **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** The chloro group is highly para-directing. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high yield of the para-isomer, typically higher than for simple alkylbenzenes like toluene and ethylbenzene.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the meta-directors before the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction, a careful step-by-step analysis is required.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe first step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring. This determines whether the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) is directed to the meta position or the ortho and para positions.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups are electron-withdrawing and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. As a result, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They produce a significantly higher yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification allows us to separate the substances into two distinct groups. The final sequence will have the meta-directors first (lowest para-yield), followed by the ortho, para-directors (highest para-yield).\n**Order:** {4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group partially offsets the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength.\n    *   **Order:** 4 < 6 < 2\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This ratio is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** Both have activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Consequently, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   **Order:** 1 < 5\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is deactivating but directs ortho, para. It has a strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) that deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   **Order:** 1 < 5 < 3\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the ordered subgroups, we get the final arrangement from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe first step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This allows us to separate the substances into two main groups: those that will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer and those that will produce a high yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene): The -NO₂ group is strongly deactivating and meta-directing.\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid): The -COOH group is deactivating and meta-directing.\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate): The -COOC₂H₅ group is deactivating and meta-directing.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.

The yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group partially offsets the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the ortho positions, making the less-crowded para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) will have a higher para-isomer yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is highly electronegative and exerts a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect. This effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric considerations, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically very high (around 87-90%), which is generally greater than that for alkylbenzenes like toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the ordered subgroups, we place the meta-directors before the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThe complete sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Final Order with the Given Options**\n\nLet's compare our derived sequence with the options provided:\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nC) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThe calculated order `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3` perfectly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molar mass of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first and most important step is to classify the substituents on the benzene ring as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing. This will separate the substances into two distinct groups: those that produce a high yield of the para-isomer and those that produce a very low yield.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position.

Order the Meta-Directing Group (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   The `-NO2` group is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The `-COOH` group is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The `-COOC2H5` group is slightly less deactivating than `-COOH` because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (`-C2H5`) slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing `-CH3` (1) and `-C2H5` (5):** The ethyl group is sterically bulkier than the methyl group. This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with `-Cl` (3):** The chlorine atom is highly para-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric effects, leads to a very high yield of the para-isomer (typically ~87-90%), which is generally higher than for alkylbenzenes.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**5. Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nWe now combine the two ordered groups, with the meta-directors coming before the ortho,para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho,para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents and Their Directing Effects**\n\nThe first step is to classify each substituent on the benzene ring based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This will allow us to separate the substances into two main groups: those that produce a high yield of the para-isomer and those that produce a very low yield.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They will have a relatively high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but still directs ortho, para.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct, so its yield will be the lowest.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final order will have the meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) at the beginning (lowest yield) and the ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) at the end (highest yield).\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nFor substances 4, 6, and 2, the para-isomer yield is very low. The order among them is determined by the strength of the deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group slightly reduces the overall electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength.\n*   The order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nFor substances 1, 5, and 3, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Therefore, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is highly para-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its own steric size, leads to a very high yield of the para-isomer (typically ~87-90%), which is generally higher than that for alkylbenzenes like toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Meta-directors order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho, para-directors order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n*   Combined Final Order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Underlying Principles**\nThe question asks to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molar mass of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar percentage yield. Therefore, we need to rank the substances by the percentage yield of the para-product.\n\nThis yield is determined by the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\nWe must classify each substituent as either an ortho,para-director or a meta-director.\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but directs ortho,para.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\nThis classification allows us to separate the substances into two distinct groups. The final order must have the meta-directors first (lowest para-yield), followed by the ortho,para-directors (highest para-yield).\nThe correct order must follow the pattern: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   The `-NO2` group is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The `-COOH` group is a stronger deactivator than the `-COOC2H5` (ester) group because the electron-donating alkyl part of the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing effect.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength.\n*   The order of increasing para-yield is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased bulk hinders attack at the ortho positions, making the para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (`-Cl`) is deactivating but strongly para-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (typically ~87-89%) is higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nWe combine the two ordered groups, with the meta-directors coming before the ortho,para-directors.\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho,para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Underlying Principles**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-bromo derivative. Since the molar mass of all monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe key principles governing the outcome are the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors** guide the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a high yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **Meta-directors** guide the electrophile to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\nWe first classify the substituent for each substance:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:**\n    *   1) -CH₃ (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but directs ortho, para.\n*   **Meta-directors:**\n    *   4) -NO₂ (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating group.\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid): Deactivating group.\n    *   2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating group.\n\n**Step 3: Initial Grouping**\nBased on the classification, we can form two distinct groups. The meta-directors will have the lowest para-yields, and the ortho, para-directors will have the highest.\n*   **Low para-yield group:** {4, 6, 2}\n*   **High para-yield group:** {1, 5, 3}\nThe final sequence will be of the form: (Order of 4, 6, 2) < (Order of 1, 5, 3).\n\n**Step 4: Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para-Yield Group)**\nFor meta-directors, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The yield of this minor product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, leading to an even smaller percentage of the para-product.\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The -NO₂ group is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n    *   The -COOH group is strongly deactivating.\n    *   The -COOC₂H₅ group is slightly less deactivating than -COOH because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (-C₂H₅) partially counteracts the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 5: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para-Yield Group)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary difference is steric bulk. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is larger than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is highly para-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric considerations, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-yield for chlorobenzene (~87-90%) is typically higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nWe now combine the two ordered groups, with the meta-directors coming before the ortho, para-directors.\n*   Order of meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: 1 < 5 < 3\n*   Combined final order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to:\nNitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n\n**Step 7: Match with the Provided Options**\nThe derived order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**. This matches option B.\n\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4 (Incorrect)\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3 (Correct)\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3 (Incorrect)\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5 (Incorrect)\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first step is to classify each substituent on the benzene ring as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This classification is the primary determinant of the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low para-yield):** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer is consequently very low.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors (High para-yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial grouping tells us that the final sequence must begin with substances 4, 6, and 2 (in some order) and end with substances 1, 5, and 3 (in some order).\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors**\nFor the meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   The -NO₂ group is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n*   The -COOH group is strongly deactivating.\n*   The -COOC₂H₅ (ester) group is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating nature of the ethyl group (-C₂H₅) partially offsets the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors**\nFor the ortho, para-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chlorine atom is an ortho, para-director but is deactivating overall. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric considerations, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene is typically very high (around 87-90%), which is greater than that for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the meta-directors before the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents and Group the Substances**\nThe first step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This allows us to separate the substances into two main groups: those that will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer and those that will produce a high yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These are deactivating groups that direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   *Conclusion*: Substances 4, 6, and 2 will have the lowest para-yields and will come first in the sequence.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product for these substances.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n    *   *Conclusion*: Substances 1, 5, and 3 will have the highest para-yields and will come last in the sequence.\n\nThe final order will have the structure: `{4, 6, 2 in some order} < {1, 5, 3 in some order}`.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Group (Lowest Para-Yield)**\nFor the meta-directors, the small amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group slightly reduces the overall electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group (Highest Para-Yield)**\nFor this group, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by both steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary difference is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size blocks the ortho positions more effectively, making the para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is highly para-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (~87-90%) is typically higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents and Group the Substances**\n\nThe first step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This allows us to separate the substances into two main groups: those that will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer and those that will produce a high yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directing Groups (Low Para-Yield):** These substituents are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position.

A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n1.  The order of deactivating strength is generally accepted as: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n2.  The -NO₂ group is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n3.  The -COOH group is also strongly deactivating.\n4.  The -COOC₂H₅ (ester) group is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (-C₂H₅) partially counteracts the electron withdrawal.\n5.  Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength.\n\nThe resulting order is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, the yield of the para-isomer is high, and the order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by both steric and electronic factors.\n\n1.  **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary factor is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more likely site for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n2.  **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is deactivating overall but is an ortho, para-director. It has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect that is distance-dependent, deactivating the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. Experimental data consistently shows that the para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n\nThe resulting order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the sequences from the two groups, we obtain the final order from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThe complete sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
