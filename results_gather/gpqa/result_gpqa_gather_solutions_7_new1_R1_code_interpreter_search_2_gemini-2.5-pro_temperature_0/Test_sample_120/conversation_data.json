Analyze the Reaction and Reactants**\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\nThe problem states that the nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   C1 is a quaternary carbon because it is bonded to a methyl group.\n*   C6 is a tertiary carbon because it is bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n*   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The methyl nucleophile attacks C6. This means the new methyl group will be on the original C6, and the hydroxyl group will be on the original C1. The product's constitutional isomer is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options C and D, which are 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereoselectivity**\nThe problem states that the reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is a hallmark of an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   The configurations at the unreacted chiral centers (C1, C3, and C4) are **retained**.\n*   The configuration at the attacked carbon (C6) is **inverted**.\n\n**4. Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome (The Critical Step)**\nThis is the most complex part of the problem and the source of disagreement among the candidate answers. We must determine the final R/S configuration of each stereocenter.\n*   **Retained Centers:**\n    *   Reactant C1 (R) → Product C1 (R)\n    *   Reactant C4 (R) → Product C4 (R)\n    *   Reactant C3 (R) → Product C5 (R) (after IUPAC renumbering)\n    *   So, the product must have the configuration (1R, ?, 4R, 5R).\n\n*   **Inverted Center (C6 → C2):**\n    *   The starting configuration is (6S). The reaction causes a geometric inversion (a Walden inversion).\n    *   A common mistake is to assume that a geometric inversion automatically flips the R/S descriptor (i.e., S becomes R). This is not always true because the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n    *   Let's analyze the priorities:\n        *   **At reactant C6:** The groups are O, C1, C5, H. The priorities are O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4).\n        *   **At product C2:** The groups are C1, C3, Me, H. The priorities are C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4).\n    *   The leaving group (O, priority 1) is replaced by the incoming nucleophile (Me, priority 3). This significant change in priorities requires a careful 3D analysis to determine the final R/S descriptor.\n    *   Let's visualize the attack. For a bicyclo[4.1.0] system, the fusion is cis. Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is 'up' (β). To satisfy the (6S) configuration, the hydrogen at C6 must also be 'up' (β). The Sₙ2 attack by the methyl nucleophile must occur from the opposite side, which is 'down' (α).\n    *   In the product, the new methyl group at C2 is 'down' (α), and the hydrogen is 'up' (β).\n    *   To assign the configuration at C2, we look at the priorities: C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4). The lowest priority group (H) is pointing 'up' (towards the viewer). We trace the path from C1 → C3 → Me, which is clockwise. Because the lowest priority group is pointing towards us, we reverse the result.\n    *   Clockwise → **S**.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C2 is **(S)**.\n\n**5. Final Product Identification**\nCombining the stereochemical results, the final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A. The majority of candidate answers that simply assumed S inverts to R were incorrect due to the change in CIP priorities.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product, synthesizing the most accurate points from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with specific stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate. Two key rules are provided:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack is an Sₙ2-type reaction, which causes an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6. We must compare their steric hindrance.\n*   **Carbon C1** is bonded to a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   A carbon substituted with a hydrogen (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than a carbon substituted with a methyl group (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n\n*   The attack at C6 adds a methyl group to that position. The C6-O bond breaks, and after a standard aqueous workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1. To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants), the ring is numbered counter-clockwise towards the newly methylated carbon.\n    *   New C1 ← Old C1 (has a methyl group)\n    *   New C2 ← Old C6 (has the new methyl group)\n    *   New C4 ← Old C4 (has a methyl group)\n    *   New C5 ← Old C3 (has a methyl group)\n*   The methyl groups are located at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-), which would result from an attack at C1.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nThis is the most critical step. We apply the rules of stereochemistry to each chiral center.\n\n*   **Unaffected Centers (C1, C3, C4):** The configurations of the stereocenters not directly involved in the nucleophilic attack are retained.\n    *   Reactant C1 (**R**) → Product C1 (**R**)\n    *   Reactant C3 (**R**) → Product C5 (**R**)\n    *   Reactant C4 (**R**) → Product C4 (**R**)\n*   **Attacked Center (C6):** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the site of attack.\n    *   The starting configuration at C6 is (**S**).\n    *   An Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (a Walden inversion). We must determine the resulting Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) descriptor.\n    *   In the reactant, the highest priority group on C6 is the epoxide oxygen. In the product, this is replaced by a methyl group, which has a lower priority than the adjacent ring carbons. When the highest priority group is replaced by a lower priority group, a geometric inversion almost always leads to an inversion of the R/S descriptor.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at this center inverts from **(S)** to **(R)**. In the product, this is the C2 position.\n*   **Final Stereochemistry:** Combining the results, the product has the following absolute configurations: (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe full IUPAC name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. Comparing this to the given options:\n\n*   A) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe derived product matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a classic organic chemistry problem involving the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. To determine the correct product, we must carefully apply the rules of regioselectivity and stereoselectivity for this specific reaction.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem provides the key rules: attack at the less hindered carbon and inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon.\n\n2.  **Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack):**\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   We must compare the steric hindrance at these two carbons.\n    *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon.\n    *   **C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon.\n    *   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1). Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n    *   This regioselectivity means the product will have a methyl group on the original C1 and a new methyl group on the original C6. The resulting product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options B and D, which have a 2,2,4,5-substitution pattern that would arise from an attack at C1.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry:**\n    *   This is the crucial step to differentiate between options A and C.\n    *   **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations. In the product, these correspond to C1, C5, and C4, respectively. So, the product will have **(1R, 4R, 5R)** configurations for these centers. Both options A and C have this part correct.\n    *   **Attacked Center (Inversion):** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon, C6. The starting configuration is **(6S)**.\n    *   A simple assumption might be that an (S) center inverts to an (R) center. However, this is not always true because the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change during the reaction. The leaving group (the epoxide oxygen) has a high priority (1), while the incoming nucleophile (the methyl group) has a lower priority. A careful analysis is required.\n    *   Let's analyze the stereochemical consequence of the inversion at C6:\n        *   **Reactant C6:** The configuration is (S).\n        *   **Reaction:** A geometric inversion (Walden inversion) occurs.\n        *   **Product C2 (from C6):** Due to the change in substituent priorities, a detailed analysis using a 3D model shows that the resulting CIP designation for the inverted center is **(S)**. The geometric inversion does not lead to a flip in the R/S descriptor in this specific case.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at the new C2 center is **(2S)**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Combining the stereochemical results, the final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n    *   This matches option A.\n\n```python\n# Final Answer Determination\n\n# The user wants to identify the correct product from a list of options for a chemical reaction.\n# The analysis proceeds in several steps:\n\n# 1.

Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with specified absolute stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate. The key rules are provided:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked (Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and H).\n*   Comparing a quaternary carbon to a tertiary carbon, C6 is significantly less sterically hindered.\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group will attack carbon **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n*   The attack at C6 adds a methyl group to that position. The C6-O bond breaks, and after workup, the oxygen at C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   To name the product via IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1. The ring is then numbered to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n*   Numbering from the new C1 towards the original C6 (which now has the new methyl group) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   Therefore, the product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options A and B, which have a different constitutional isomer name (`2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`). The correct answer must be either C or D.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n*   This is the deciding step between options C and D.\n*   The configurations at the stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) are **retained**.\n*   The configuration at the stereocenter that is attacked (C6) is **inverted**.\n*   Let's map the stereochemistry from the reactant to the product, using the new IUPAC numbering:\n    *   Reactant **C1 (R)** → Product **C1 (R)** (retained)\n    *   Reactant **C3 (R)** → Product **C5 (R)** (retained)\n    *   Reactant **C4 (R)** → Product **C4 (R)** (retained)\n    *   Reactant **C6 (S)** → Product **C2 (?)** (inverted)\n\n*   The crucial point is determining the final R/S descriptor for the inverted center. A geometric Sₙ2 inversion does not always lead to a flip in the R/S descriptor, because the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n    *   **At reactant C6:** The substituents are -O- (from epoxide), -C1-, -C5-, and -H. The priority order is O > C1 > C5 > H. The configuration is (S).\n    *   **At product C2 (from C6):** The substituents are the newly added -CH₃, the adjacent -C1(OH)-, -C3(orig C5)-, and -H. The priority order is C1(OH) > C3 > CH₃ > H.\n    *   The leaving group (-O-) had the highest priority (1). The incoming group (-CH₃) has a lower priority (3). This significant change in priorities means we must carefully re-evaluate the configuration.\n    *   A detailed 3D analysis shows that the geometric inversion of the (6S) center results in a product with a **(2S)** configuration. The Sₙ2 attack causes the spatial arrangement to invert, but the change in substituent priorities results in the R/S descriptor remaining the same.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n*   The product's constitution is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   The product's absolute configuration is (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R).\n*   Combining these gives the full name: **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with the specified absolute stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem provides the key rules for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack is an Sₙ2-type reaction, which proceeds with an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nWe must compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Constitution and IUPAC Name**\n\n*   The attack on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After an aqueous workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product has the original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, plus a new methyl group at C6.\n*   To name the product, we follow IUPAC rules. The carbon with the principal functional group (-OH) is designated as the new C1. This corresponds to the original C1.\n*   We number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1 (towards the original C6) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n*   The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options A and B, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-).\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nThis is the most critical step. We must determine the absolute configuration (R/S) of each chiral center in the product.\n*   **C1, C3, and C4:** These centers are not directly attacked. Their configurations are retained.\n    *   New C1 (from original C1) remains **(R)**.\n    *   New C4 (from original C4) remains **(R)**.\n    *   New C5 (from original C3) remains **(R)**.\n*   **C2 (from C6):** This is the site of the Sₙ2 attack, so its configuration is inverted. The starting configuration was **(6S)**. We must carefully determine the resulting configuration after inversion.\n\n**Analysis of Inversion at C6(S) → C2(?)**\nAn Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (like an umbrella flipping inside out). However, the R/S descriptor may or may not flip, because the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n\n*   **Priorities at reactant C6:** The groups are O, C1, C5, H. The priorities are O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4). The configuration is (S).\n*   **Priorities at product C2 (old C6):** The groups are C1, C3(old C5), Me, H. The leaving group (O, priority 1) has been replaced by the incoming nucleophile (Me, new priority 3). The priorities of the other groups also shift. The new priority order is C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4).\n\nBecause the geometric inversion is accompanied by a significant change in substituent priorities (the highest priority group is replaced by a lower priority group), the R/S descriptor does not flip. The geometric inversion and the priority re-ordering effectively cancel each other out in terms of the final descriptor. A detailed analysis confirms that the inverted center becomes **(S)**.\n\n*   **Geometric Inversion:** S → R\n*   **Priority Change:** R → S\n*   **Net Result:** S → S\n\nTherefore, the configuration at the new C2 is **(S)**.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nCombining the stereochemical assignments, the final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect constitution and stereochemistry.\nB) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect constitution and stereochemistry.\nC) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - **This matches our derived product exactly.**\nD) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product from the given options.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with the specified absolute stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate. The key rules are provided:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon that is attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nWe must compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n\n*   The attack of a methyl group at C6 and the subsequent opening of the epoxide ring (with protonation during workup) results in a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1. Numbering the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the methyl groups results in the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. The methyl groups are at the new C1, C2 (the original C6), C4, and C5 positions.\n*   This constitutional name eliminates options A and D, which are named as 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, implying attack at C1. The correct answer must be either B or C.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nThis is the most critical step. We apply the rules of stereochemistry to each chiral center.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The configurations at the stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction are retained.\n    *   The configuration at C1 remains **R**.\n    *   The configuration at C3 (which becomes C5 in the product) remains **R**.\n    *   The configuration at C4 remains **R**.\n*   **Attacked Center:** The reaction causes a geometric inversion at the site of attack, C6 (which becomes C2 in the product). The starting configuration at C6 is **S**.\n\n**The Pitfall: Geometric Inversion vs. R/S Descriptor Change**\nA geometric inversion (like an umbrella flipping inside out) does not automatically mean the R/S descriptor will flip from S to R. The descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents, which change during the reaction.\n\n*   **At C6 (reactant):** The substituents are O, C1, C5, H. The priorities are O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4).\n*   **At C2 (product):** The substituents are C1, C3, Me, H. The priorities are C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4).\n\nThe leaving group (the epoxide oxygen) had the highest priority (1). The incoming nucleophile (the methyl group) has a lower priority (3). This change in substituent priorities causes the R/S descriptor to be retained, even though the 3D geometry has inverted. Therefore, the (S) configuration at C6 becomes an (S) configuration at the new C2 center.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the stereochemical results:\n*   C1 is **R**.\n*   C2 is **S**.\n*   C4 is **R**.\n*   C5 is **R**.\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product, synthesizing the most accurate points from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem provides the key rules:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\nThe first step is to identify which carbon of the epoxide (C1 or C6) is less sterically hindered.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nA tertiary carbon is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n\nThe attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. A new methyl group is added to C6, and the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after workup.\n*   To name the product, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new C1.\n*   Numbering the ring to give the lowest locants to the four methyl groups results in the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This constitutional structure eliminates options B and D, which are named as 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, implying the attack happened at C1. The correct answer must be either A or C.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nThis is the most critical step. We must determine the absolute configuration (R/S) of each chiral center in the product.\n*   **Unaffected Centers (C1, C3, C4):** The configurations of the stereocenters not directly attacked are retained.\n    *   The original C1 was **(R)**. It becomes the new C1, so the product is **(1R)**.\n    *   The original C4 was **(R)**. It becomes the new C4, so the product is **(4R)**.\n    *   The original C3 was **(R)**. It becomes the new C5, so the product is **(5R)**.\n    *   So far, the product is (1R, ? , 4R, 5R)... This is consistent with both options A and C.\n\n*   **Attacked Center (C6):** The reaction causes an inversion of configuration at the site of attack.\n    *   The original C6 had an **(S)** configuration.\n    *   An Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (a Walden inversion). However, the R/S descriptor does not always flip. The descriptor must be reassigned based on the new set of substituents and their Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities.\n    *   A detailed 3D analysis of the anti-diaxial ring opening shows that the incoming methyl group replaces the C-O bond. While the geometry inverts, the change in substituent priorities results in the new stereocenter at C2 also having an **(S)** configuration.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the constitutional and stereochemical analyses:\n*   **Name:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:** (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers and resolving their contradictions.\n\n**1. Analysis of Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with a specific 3D arrangement defined by the (R) and (S) descriptors.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The provided information and general chemical principles establish two critical rules:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack is an Sₙ2-type reaction, which causes an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Determining the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nThe first step is to identify which carbon of the epoxide (C1 or C6) is less sterically hindered.\n*   **Carbon C1** is bonded to a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more hindered than a tertiary one. Therefore, all candidate analyses correctly conclude that the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determining the Product's Constitution and Base Name**\n\nThe attack at C6 and subsequent opening of the epoxide ring determines the product's basic structure.\n*   A methyl group is added to the original C6.\n*   The C6-O bond breaks, and after an aqueous workup (a standard final step), the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups. To name it via IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new C1. Numbering the ring to give the methyl groups the lowest possible locants results in the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This constitutional outcome correctly eliminates options B and C, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol). The final answer must be either A or D.\n\n**4. Determining the Final Stereochemistry**\n\nThis is the most critical step and the source of disagreement among the candidate answers. We must apply the rules of stereochemistry precisely.\n\n*   **Retention at Unreacted Centers:** The configurations at the stereocenters not directly attacked are retained.\n    *   Original C1 (R) becomes new C1 → **(1R)**\n    *   Original C4 (R) becomes new C4 → **(4R)**\n    *   Original C3 (R) becomes new C5 → **(5R)**\n\n*   **Inversion at the Attacked Center:** The reaction causes a geometric inversion at C6. The original configuration is **(6S)**. The key question is whether this geometric inversion results in a new configuration of (R) or (S). This depends on how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n\n    *   **Priorities at Reactant C6:** The groups are -O- (from epoxide), -C1-, -C5-, and -H. The priority order is: **O (1)** > C1 (2) > C5 (3) > H (4).\n    *   **Priorities at Product C2 (from C6):** The groups are -C1- (now with an OH), -C3- (the old C5), the new **-CH₃**, and -H. The priority order is: **C1 (1)** > C3 (2) > **CH₃ (3)** > H (4).\n\n    The Sₙ2 reaction replaces the highest priority group (-O-, rank 1) with a group of lower priority (-CH₃, rank 3). This change in substituent priorities means that a geometric inversion does not automatically lead to an inversion of the R/S descriptor. A careful analysis, as performed correctly by a minority of the candidate answers (e.g., answers 4 and 10), shows that the geometric inversion of the (S) center at C6 results in a new stereocenter at C2 with an **(S)** configuration.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nCombining the stereochemical results, the final product is: **(1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nComparing this to the options:\n*   A) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe correct product is given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product, synthesizing the most accurate points from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with the specified absolute stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is `Me₂CuLi` (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem provides the key rules:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack is an Sₙ2-type reaction, which proceeds with an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\n*   We must compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a quaternary center (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary center (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   The quaternary carbon (C1) is significantly more sterically hindered than the tertiary carbon (C6).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n\n*   The attack on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and is protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product has an -OH group and a methyl group on the original C1 carbon, a new methyl group on the original C6 carbon, and the original methyl groups on the C3 and C4 carbons.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new **C1**.\n*   Numbering the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants results in the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2 (from the attack on C6), 4, and 5.\n*   This constitutional analysis eliminates options B and D, which have the incorrect `2,2,4,5-` substitution pattern. The choice is between A and C.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\n*   The stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) **retain their original configuration**.\n*   The stereocenter that is attacked (C6) undergoes an **inversion of configuration**.\n*   Let's map the stereochemistry from the reactant to the product using the new IUPAC numbering:\n    *   Reactant **C1 (R)** → Product **C1 (R)** (retained)\n    *   Reactant **C4 (R)** → Product **C4 (R)** (retained)\n    *   Reactant **C3 (R)** → Product **C5 (R)** (retained)\n    *   Reactant **C6 (S)** → Product **C2 (inverted)**\n\n*   **The Critical Step: Assigning the R/S descriptor to the new C2.**\n    A simple assumption would be that the inversion of an (S) center leads to an (R) center. However, this is only true if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents do not change their order. In this case, the leaving group (the epoxide oxygen, high priority) is replaced by the incoming nucleophile (a methyl group, lower priority). This change in priorities requires a careful re-evaluation of the R/S configuration from the 3D structure.\n\n*   **3D Analysis:**\n    1.  A detailed analysis of the starting material's stereochemistry `(1R,3R,4R,6S)` shows that the epoxide oxygen and the hydrogen at C6 are on the same face of the ring (e.g., both \"up\" or β).\n    2.  The Sₙ2 attack requires the nucleophile (Me⁻) to approach from the opposite face. So, if the C6-O bond is \"up\", the Me⁻ attacks from \"down\".\n    3.  This attack causes a geometric inversion: the hydrogen at C6, which was \"up\", is pushed \"down\". The new methyl group is now \"down\".\n    4.  Now we assign the CIP configuration to this new C2 center. The substituents are C1(OH), C3, Me, and H. The priorities are: C1 > C3 > Me > H.\n    5.  With the lowest priority group (H) now pointing \"down\" (away from the viewer), we trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (C1 → C3 → Me). This path is counter-clockwise.\n    6.  A counter-clockwise path with the lowest priority group in the back corresponds to an **(S)** configuration.\n\n*   Therefore, despite the geometric inversion, the configuration at C6(S) becomes C2(**S**) due to the change in substituent priorities.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The final product has the following stereochemistry:\n    *   C1: **R**\n    *   C2: **S**\n    *   C4: **R**\n    *   C5: **R**\n*   The full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Principles:** The problem provides the key rules for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction is an Sₙ2-type attack, which causes an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nWe need to compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, not a methyl group, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n\nThe attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. The nucleophilic methyl group is added to C6, and after a standard aqueous workup, a hydroxyl (-OH) group is formed at C1.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new C1. The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   The methyl groups are located at the new C1 (original C1), new C2 (original C6, where the attack occurred), new C4 (original C4), and new C5 (original C3).\n    *   This gives the locant set {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n*   The product is therefore a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This constitutional structure eliminates options A and B, which are named as 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (implying attack at C1). The choice is between C and D.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nThe reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked center (C6) and retention of configuration at the other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4).\n*   **Configuration at C1:** Retained. It was (R) and remains **(R)**.\n*   **Configuration at C3:** Retained. It was (R). In the new numbering, this is C5, so it is **(5R)**.\n*   **Configuration at C4:** Retained. It was (R) and remains **(4R)**.\n*   **Configuration at C6:** Inverted. It was (S). The Sₙ2 attack inverts the stereocenter to **(R)**. In the new numbering, this is C2, so it is **(2R)**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the constitutional name and the stereochemical descriptors, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nComparing this to the remaining options:\n*   C) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe correct product matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a detailed, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, and the absolute stereochemistry at these four chiral centers is specified.\n*   **Reagent:** `Me₂CuLi` (Lithium dimethylcuprate), known as a Gilman reagent, provides a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate. The provided rules are standard for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack is an Sₙ2-type reaction, which causes an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nWe must compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is part of the epoxide and is also substituted with a methyl group. This makes C1 a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to the epoxide oxygen, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is also part of the epoxide but is bonded to a hydrogen atom instead of a methyl group. This makes C6 a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to the epoxide oxygen, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the methyl nucleophile will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n\nThe attack on C6 opens the epoxide ring. After a standard aqueous workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with the original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, plus a new methyl group at C6.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new **C1**.\n*   We then number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1 (original C1) towards the newly substituted carbon (original C6) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering clockwise would give the locant set {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n*   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower. Therefore, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and D, which have a different substitution pattern (`2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...`) that would result from an attack at C1.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nThis is the most critical step. We apply the Sₙ2 rule of inversion.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The configurations of the stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) are retained.\n    *   Original C1(R) → New C1(R)\n    *   Original C4(R) → New C4(R)\n    *   Original C3(R) → New C5(R)\n*   **Attacked Center:** The configuration at C6 is inverted.\n    *   Original C6 has an (S) configuration.\n    *   The Sₙ2 attack causes a geometric inversion at this center. However, we must be careful. An inversion of the 3D arrangement does not automatically mean the R/S descriptor flips. The descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the new substituents.\n    *   Let's analyze the change at C6 (which becomes C2):\n        *   **At reactant C6:** The groups are O, C1, C5, H. The priorities are O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4). The configuration is (S).\n        *   **At product C2:** The groups are C1, C3, Me, H. The priorities are C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4).\n    *   The Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (a Walden inversion). The leaving group (O, priority 1) is replaced by the incoming nucleophile (Me, priority 3). Due to this significant change in priorities, a geometric inversion of the (S) center results in a new center that is also designated as **(S)**.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at the new C2 is **(S)**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the constitutional and stereochemical analyses:\n*   **Name:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:** (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with the specified absolute stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem provides the key rules for this specific reaction.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n*   The first rule given is: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6.\n*   We must compare the steric hindrance at these two carbons.\n    *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a more sterically hindered tertiary carbon center.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a hydrogen atom, making it a less sterically hindered tertiary carbon center.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n*   The attack at C6 adds a methyl group to that carbon. The epoxide ring opens, and after an aqueous workup (a standard step to quench the reaction and protonate the intermediate), a hydroxyl (-OH) group is formed at C1.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups. To name it according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1. The ring is then numbered to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   The methyl groups are located at the original C1, C3, C4, and the newly added one at C6.\n    *   Numbering from the new C1 (original C1) towards the newly substituted carbon (original C6) gives the locant set {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n*   The constitutional name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options A and B, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-), which would result from an attack at C1.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n*   The second rule given is: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   The nucleophilic attack occurs at C6, which has an initial configuration of **(S)**.\n*   The Sₙ2 attack causes an inversion of this stereocenter. Therefore, the configuration at this carbon in the product will be **(R)**.\n*   The other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly involved in the substitution reaction, so their configurations are retained.\n*   Now, we map the stereochemistry from the reactant to the product using the new IUPAC numbering:\n    *   **New C1** (from original C1): Configuration is retained → **(1R)**\n    *   **New C2** (from original C6): Configuration is inverted (S → R) → **(2R)**\n    *   **New C4** (from original C4): Configuration is retained → **(4R)**\n    *   **New C5** (from original C3): Configuration is retained → **(5R)**\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n*   Combining the constitutional name and the stereochemistry, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product, synthesizing the most accurate points from the provided answers and correcting any inconsistencies.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Starting Material and Reagents**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n**2. Regioselectivity: Where does the attack occur?**\n\nThe problem states that the organocuprate attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n*   **C1** is a **quaternary** carbon because it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to the epoxide oxygen and two other ring carbons.\n*   **C6** is a **tertiary** carbon because it is bonded to a hydrogen atom, the epoxide oxygen, and two other ring carbons.\n*   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic attack by the methyl group will occur at **C6**.\n\nThis conclusion allows us to determine the basic structure (constitution) of the product. The attack adds a methyl group to C6 and creates a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1. When renumbered according to IUPAC rules, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and D, which have a 2,2,4,5- substitution pattern that would result from an attack at C1.\n\n**3. Stereoselectivity: How does the attack occur?**\n\nThe problem states that the reaction causes an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon where the nucleophile is added. This is the hallmark of an Sₙ2 reaction, where the nucleophile performs a \"backside attack\" opposite to the C-O bond.\n\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) will **retain** their original configurations.\n    *   C1 remains **(R)**.\n    *   C3 remains **(R)**.\n    *   C4 remains **(R)**.\n*   **Attacked Center (C6):** The configuration at C6, which is **(S)** in the starting material, will be inverted.\n\n**4. The Critical Point: Does S invert to R?**\n\nA simple assumption would be that inverting an (S) center automatically makes it (R). However, this is not always true because the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents changes during the reaction.\n\n*   **At reactant C6:** The leaving group is the epoxide oxygen, which has the highest priority (1).\n*   **At product C2 (the new name for the C6 carbon):** The incoming group is a methyl group, which has a lower priority than the adjacent ring carbons.\n*   A careful analysis of the CIP priorities before and after the geometric inversion reveals that the descriptor for the inverted center remains **(S)**. The spatial arrangement of the atoms is indeed inverted, but the label assigned by the CIP rules does not change from S to R.\n*   Therefore, the configuration at the new C2 is **(S)**.\n\n**5. Assembling the Final Product Name**\n\nWe combine the IUPAC numbering with the stereochemical analysis:\n*   The product name is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   The stereochemistry is:\n    *   **New C1** (from original C1): Retained as **(R)**.\n    *   **New C2** (from original C6): Inverted, resulting in **(S)**.\n    *   **New C4** (from original C4): Retained as **(R)**.\n    *   **New C5** (from original C3): Retained as **(R)**.\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product based on the provided information and chemical principles.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It is substituted with methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\nThe problem states a key rule: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to four non-hydrogen atoms: O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to three non-hydrogen atoms: O, C1, and C5).\n*   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\nThis regioselectivity means the product will have a hydroxyl group at C1 and a new methyl group at C6. When renumbered according to IUPAC rules, the product will be a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options A and D, which have a different substitution pattern (`2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...`) that would result from an attack at C1. The correct answer must be either B or C.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereoselectivity**\n\nThe problem states the second key rule: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is the defining characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   The nucleophilic attack occurs at carbon C6.\n*   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(S)**.\n*   The Sₙ2 mechanism causes a Walden inversion at this center. The most direct interpretation of this rule is that the stereochemical descriptor flips. Therefore, the (S) configuration at C6 becomes an **(R)** configuration in the product.\n*   The other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly attacked, so their configurations are retained.\n\n**4. Assemble the Final Product's Name**\n\nWe combine the regiochemical and stereochemical outcomes and map them to the new IUPAC numbering of the product:\n*   **Numbering:** The carbon with the -OH group (original C1) becomes the new C1. The adjacent carbon that was attacked (original C6) becomes the new C2. The original C4 becomes the new C4, and the original C3 becomes the new C5.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **New C1** (from original C1): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n    *   **New C2** (from original C6): Configuration is inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n    *   **New C4** (from original C4): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n    *   **New C5** (from original C3): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n\nThe full name of the resulting product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n\nComparing this result to the remaining options:\n*   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur derived product matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with the specified absolute stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The prompt provides the key rules for this specific reaction.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\n*   The first rule states that the alkyl group of the organocuprate is introduced at the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n*   **C1** is a **quaternary** carbon because it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to the other ring carbons (C2 and C6) and the epoxide oxygen.\n*   **C6** is a **tertiary** carbon because it is bonded to a hydrogen atom, two ring carbons (C1 and C5), and the epoxide oxygen.\n*   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\nThis regioselectivity means the resulting product will be a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. The attack at C6 places the new methyl group on the carbon adjacent (C2 in the product) to the carbon that will bear the hydroxyl group (C1 in the product). This immediately eliminates options A and D, which are 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol isomers that would result from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either B or C.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereoselectivity**\n\n*   The second rule states that **inversion of configuration** occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction mechanism.\n*   The attack occurs at C6, which has an initial configuration of **(S)**.\n*   The other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4) are not directly attacked and therefore **retain** their original configurations: (1R), (3R), and (4R).\n*   The crucial step is to determine the final configuration of the attacked carbon. While the Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (a \"Walden inversion\"), the resulting R/S descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the new substituent compared to the old one. A simple flip of the letter (S → R) is not guaranteed. A careful analysis is required.\n\n**4. Detailed Stereochemical Analysis**\n\n1.  **Starting Material 3D Structure:** For (1R,3R,4R,6S), a consistent 3D representation places the epoxide oxygen and the C1-methyl group on the same face of the ring (cis, let's call this \"up\" or β), while the hydrogen at C6 is on the opposite face (\"down\" or α).\n2.  **Backside Attack:** Since the C6-O bond is \"up\", the nucleophilic methyl group must attack from the \"down\" side (the α face) to achieve the required backside attack.\n3.  **Geometric Inversion:** The original hydrogen at C6, which was \"down\", is pushed \"up\" by the incoming nucleophile. The new methyl group is now attached to the \"down\" face.\n4.  **Assigning the New Configuration:** We now assign the R/S configuration to the product's C2 (which was the original C6).\n    *   The groups attached are H (\"up\"), the new Me (\"down\"), C1, and C3.\n    *   The CIP priorities are: C1 > C3 > new Me > H.\n    *   With the lowest priority group (H) pointing towards the viewer (\"up\"/wedge), we trace the path from priority 1 (C1) to 2 (C3) to 3 (Me). This path is clockwise.\n    *   According to CIP rules, a clockwise path when the lowest priority group is pointing towards the viewer corresponds to an **(S)** configuration.\n5.  **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The geometric inversion at the C6(S) center results in a product with a C2(S) configuration. The descriptor does not change in this specific case.\n\n**5. Final Product Assembly**\n\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   C1 retains its configuration: **(1R)**\n    *   C2 (from C6) has its configuration determined as **(2S)**.\n    *   C4 retains its configuration: **(4R)**\n    *   C5 (from C3) retains its configuration: **(5R)**\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide, providing two key rules:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked (Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n### 2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)\nThe first step is to identify which carbon of the epoxide (C1 or C6) is less sterically hindered.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nA tertiary carbon is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n### 3. Determine the Constitution of the Product\nThe site of attack determines the basic structure (constitutional isomer) of the product.\n*   Attack at C6 adds a methyl group to that position. The C6-O bond breaks, and after workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol. To name it according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1. To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers, the ring is numbered towards the newly methylated carbon (the original C6), which becomes the new C2.\n*   The resulting product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This constitutional structure immediately eliminates options C and D, which are named as `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`, a structure that would result from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either A or B.\n\n### 4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\nThis is the deciding step between options A and B. We must apply the rules of stereochemistry to each chiral center.\n\n*   **Unaffected Centers (C1, C3, C4):** The configurations of the stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction are retained.\n    *   Reactant **C1 (R)** → Product **C1 (R)**\n    *   Reactant **C4 (R)** → Product **C4 (R)**\n    *   Reactant **C3 (R)** → Product **C5 (R)** (after renumbering)\n    *   So, the product's partial stereochemistry is (1R, ?, 4R, 5R). Both options A and B match this.\n\n*   **Attacked Center (C6):** The reaction causes an inversion of configuration at the site of attack. The starting configuration at C6 is **(S)**. The crucial point is to determine the resulting R/S descriptor after the inversion. A simple assumption that (S) inverts to (R) is often incorrect because the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n\n*   **Detailed Analysis of Inversion:**\n    1.  **Geometric Inversion:** The Sₙ2 attack causes a Walden inversion, meaning the 3D arrangement of the groups on C6 flips like an umbrella in the wind.\n    2.  **Priority Change:** The leaving group (the epoxide oxygen) has the highest priority (#1) on C6. The incoming nucleophile (the methyl group) has a lower priority (#3 in the product, after C1 and C3).\n    3.  **Resulting Descriptor:** When a geometric inversion is accompanied by a significant change in substituent priorities (like the highest priority group being replaced by a lower priority one), the R/S descriptor often does not flip. A rigorous 3D analysis confirms this: the geometric inversion of the (6S) center, combined with the re-ordering of priorities, results in a new stereocenter at C2 with an **(S)** configuration.\n\n### 5. Final Conclusion\nCombining the constitutional and stereochemical analyses:\n*   **Name:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:** (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.

This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\nThe problem states that the nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   C1 is a quaternary carbon because it is bonded to a methyl group.\n*   C6 is a tertiary carbon because it is bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n*   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The methyl nucleophile attacks C6. This means the new methyl group will be on the original C6, and the hydroxyl group will be on the original C1. The product's constitutional isomer is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options C and D, which are 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereoselectivity**\nThe problem states that the reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is a hallmark of an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   The configurations at the unreacted chiral centers (C1, C3, and C4) are **retained**.\n*   The configuration at the attacked carbon (C6) is **inverted**.\n\n**4. Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome (The Critical Step)**\nThis is the most complex part of the problem and the source of disagreement among the candidate answers. We must determine the final R/S configuration of each stereocenter.\n*   **Retained Centers:**\n    *   Reactant C1 (R) → Product C1 (R)\n    *   Reactant C4 (R) → Product C4 (R)\n    *   Reactant C3 (R) → Product C5 (R) (after IUPAC renumbering)\n    *   So, the product must have the configuration (1R, ?, 4R, 5R).\n\n*   **Inverted Center (C6 → C2):**\n    *   The starting configuration is (6S). The reaction causes a geometric inversion (a Walden inversion).\n    *   A common mistake is to assume that a geometric inversion automatically flips the R/S descriptor (i.e., S becomes R). This is not always true because the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n    *   Let's analyze the priorities:\n        *   **At reactant C6:** The groups are O, C1, C5, H. The priorities are O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4).\n        *   **At product C2:** The groups are C1, C3, Me, H. The priorities are C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4).\n    *   The leaving group (O, priority 1) is replaced by the incoming nucleophile (Me, priority 3). This significant change in priorities requires a careful 3D analysis to determine the final R/S descriptor.\n    *   Let's visualize the attack. For a bicyclo[4.1.0] system, the fusion is cis. Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is 'up' (β). To satisfy the (6S) configuration, the hydrogen at C6 must also be 'up' (β). The Sₙ2 attack by the methyl nucleophile must occur from the opposite side, which is 'down' (α).\n    *   In the product, the new methyl group at C2 is 'down' (α), and the hydrogen is 'up' (β).\n    *   To assign the configuration at C2, we look at the priorities: C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4). The lowest priority group (H) is pointing 'up' (towards the viewer). We trace the path from C1 → C3 → Me, which is clockwise. Because the lowest priority group is pointing towards us, we reverse the result.\n    *   Clockwise → **S**.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C2 is **(S)**.\n\n**5. Final Product Identification**\nCombining the stereochemical results, the final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.

Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with specific stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate. Two key rules are provided:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack is an Sₙ2-type reaction, which causes an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6. We must compare their steric hindrance.\n*   **Carbon C1** is bonded to a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   A carbon substituted with a hydrogen (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than a carbon substituted with a methyl group (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n\n*   The attack at C6 adds a methyl group to that position. The C6-O bond breaks, and after a standard aqueous workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1. To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants), the ring is numbered counter-clockwise towards the newly methylated carbon.\n    *   New C1 ← Old C1 (has a methyl group)\n    *   New C2 ← Old C6 (has the new methyl group)\n    *   New C4 ← Old C4 (has a methyl group)\n    *   New C5 ← Old C3 (has a methyl group)\n*   The methyl groups are located at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-), which would result from an attack at C1.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nThis is the most critical step. We apply the rules of stereochemistry to each chiral center.\n\n*   **Unaffected Centers (C1, C3, C4):** The configurations of the stereocenters not directly involved in the nucleophilic attack are retained.\n    *   Reactant C1 (**R**) → Product C1 (**R**)\n    *   Reactant C3 (**R**) → Product C5 (**R**)\n    *   Reactant C4 (**R**) → Product C4 (**R**)\n*   **Attacked Center (C6):** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the site of attack.\n    *   The starting configuration at C6 is (**S**).\n    *   An Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (a Walden inversion). We must determine the resulting Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) descriptor.\n    *   In the reactant, the highest priority group on C6 is the epoxide oxygen. In the product, this is replaced by a methyl group, which has a lower priority than the adjacent ring carbons. When the highest priority group is replaced by a lower priority group, a geometric inversion almost always leads to an inversion of the R/S descriptor.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at this center inverts from **(S)** to **(R)**. In the product, this is the C2 position.\n*   **Final Stereochemistry:** Combining the results, the product has the following absolute configurations: (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe full IUPAC name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. Comparing this to the given options:\n\n*   A) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe derived product matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a classic organic chemistry problem involving the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. To determine the correct product, we must carefully apply the rules of regioselectivity and stereoselectivity for this specific reaction.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem provides the key rules: attack at the less hindered carbon and inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon.\n\n2.  **Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack):**\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   We must compare the steric hindrance at these two carbons.\n    *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon.\n    *   **C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon.\n    *   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1). Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n    *   This regioselectivity means the product will have a methyl group on the original C1 and a new methyl group on the original C6. The resulting product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options B and D, which have a 2,2,4,5-substitution pattern that would arise from an attack at C1.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry:**\n    *   This is the crucial step to differentiate between options A and C.\n    *   **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations. In the product, these correspond to C1, C5, and C4, respectively. So, the product will have **(1R, 4R, 5R)** configurations for these centers. Both options A and C have this part correct.\n    *   **Attacked Center (Inversion):** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon, C6. The starting configuration is **(6S)**.\n    *   A simple assumption might be that an (S) center inverts to an (R) center. However, this is not always true because the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change during the reaction. The leaving group (the epoxide oxygen) has a high priority (1), while the incoming nucleophile (the methyl group) has a lower priority. A careful analysis is required.\n    *   Let's analyze the stereochemical consequence of the inversion at C6:\n        *   **Reactant C6:** The configuration is (S).\n        *   **Reaction:** A geometric inversion (Walden inversion) occurs.\n        *   **Product C2 (from C6):** Due to the change in substituent priorities, a detailed analysis using a 3D model shows that the resulting CIP designation for the inverted center is **(S)**. The geometric inversion does not lead to a flip in the R/S descriptor in this specific case.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at the new C2 center is **(2S)**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Combining the stereochemical results, the final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n    *   This matches option A.\n\n```python\n# Final Answer Determination\n\n# The user wants to identify the correct product from a list of options for a chemical reaction.\n# The analysis proceeds in several steps:\n\n# 1.

Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with specified absolute stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate. The key rules are provided:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked (Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and H).\n*   Comparing a quaternary carbon to a tertiary carbon, C6 is significantly less sterically hindered.\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group will attack carbon **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n*   The attack at C6 adds a methyl group to that position. The C6-O bond breaks, and after workup, the oxygen at C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   To name the product via IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1. The ring is then numbered to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n*   Numbering from the new C1 towards the original C6 (which now has the new methyl group) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   Therefore, the product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options A and B, which have a different constitutional isomer name (`2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`). The correct answer must be either C or D.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n*   This is the deciding step between options C and D.\n*   The configurations at the stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) are **retained**.\n*   The configuration at the stereocenter that is attacked (C6) is **inverted**.\n*   Let's map the stereochemistry from the reactant to the product, using the new IUPAC numbering:\n    *   Reactant **C1 (R)** → Product **C1 (R)** (retained)\n    *   Reactant **C3 (R)** → Product **C5 (R)** (retained)\n    *   Reactant **C4 (R)** → Product **C4 (R)** (retained)\n    *   Reactant **C6 (S)** → Product **C2 (?)** (inverted)\n\n*   The crucial point is determining the final R/S descriptor for the inverted center. A geometric Sₙ2 inversion does not always lead to a flip in the R/S descriptor, because the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n    *   **At reactant C6:** The substituents are -O- (from epoxide), -C1-, -C5-, and -H. The priority order is O > C1 > C5 > H. The configuration is (S).\n    *   **At product C2 (from C6):** The substituents are the newly added -CH₃, the adjacent -C1(OH)-, -C3(orig C5)-, and -H. The priority order is C1(OH) > C3 > CH₃ > H.\n    *   The leaving group (-O-) had the highest priority (1). The incoming group (-CH₃) has a lower priority (3). This significant change in priorities means we must carefully re-evaluate the configuration.\n    *   A detailed 3D analysis shows that the geometric inversion of the (6S) center results in a product with a **(2S)** configuration. The Sₙ2 attack causes the spatial arrangement to invert, but the change in substituent priorities results in the R/S descriptor remaining the same.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n*   The product's constitution is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   The product's absolute configuration is (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R).\n*   Combining these gives the full name: **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with the specified absolute stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem provides the key rules for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack is an Sₙ2-type reaction, which proceeds with an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nWe must compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Constitution and IUPAC Name**\n\n*   The attack on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After an aqueous workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product has the original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, plus a new methyl group at C6.\n*   To name the product, we follow IUPAC rules. The carbon with the principal functional group (-OH) is designated as the new C1. This corresponds to the original C1.\n*   We number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1 (towards the original C6) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n*   The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options A and B, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-).\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nThis is the most critical step. We must determine the absolute configuration (R/S) of each chiral center in the product.\n*   **C1, C3, and C4:** These centers are not directly attacked. Their configurations are retained.\n    *   New C1 (from original C1) remains **(R)**.\n    *   New C4 (from original C4) remains **(R)**.\n    *   New C5 (from original C3) remains **(R)**.\n*   **C2 (from C6):** This is the site of the Sₙ2 attack, so its configuration is inverted. The starting configuration was **(6S)**. We must carefully determine the resulting configuration after inversion.\n\n**Analysis of Inversion at C6(S) → C2(?)**\nAn Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (like an umbrella flipping inside out). However, the R/S descriptor may or may not flip, because the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n\n*   **Priorities at reactant C6:** The groups are O, C1, C5, H. The priorities are O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4). The configuration is (S).\n*   **Priorities at product C2 (old C6):** The groups are C1, C3(old C5), Me, H. The leaving group (O, priority 1) has been replaced by the incoming nucleophile (Me, new priority 3). The priorities of the other groups also shift. The new priority order is C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4).\n\nBecause the geometric inversion is accompanied by a significant change in substituent priorities (the highest priority group is replaced by a lower priority group), the R/S descriptor does not flip. The geometric inversion and the priority re-ordering effectively cancel each other out in terms of the final descriptor. A detailed analysis confirms that the inverted center becomes **(S)**.\n\n*   **Geometric Inversion:** S → R\n*   **Priority Change:** R → S\n*   **Net Result:** S → S\n\nTherefore, the configuration at the new C2 is **(S)**.\n\n**5.

Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nWe must compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n\n*   The attack of a methyl group at C6 and the subsequent opening of the epoxide ring (with protonation during workup) results in a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1. Numbering the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the methyl groups results in the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. The methyl groups are at the new C1, C2 (the original C6), C4, and C5 positions.\n*   This constitutional name eliminates options A and D, which are named as 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, implying attack at C1. The correct answer must be either B or C.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nThis is the most critical step. We apply the rules of stereochemistry to each chiral center.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The configurations at the stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction are retained.\n    *   The configuration at C1 remains **R**.\n    *   The configuration at C3 (which becomes C5 in the product) remains **R**.\n    *   The configuration at C4 remains **R**.\n*   **Attacked Center:** The reaction causes a geometric inversion at the site of attack, C6 (which becomes C2 in the product). The starting configuration at C6 is **S**.\n\n**The Pitfall: Geometric Inversion vs. R/S Descriptor Change**\nA geometric inversion (like an umbrella flipping inside out) does not automatically mean the R/S descriptor will flip from S to R. The descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents, which change during the reaction.\n\n*   **At C6 (reactant):** The substituents are O, C1, C5, H. The priorities are O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4).\n*   **At C2 (product):** The substituents are C1, C3, Me, H. The priorities are C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4).\n\nThe leaving group (the epoxide oxygen) had the highest priority (1). The incoming nucleophile (the methyl group) has a lower priority (3). This change in substituent priorities causes the R/S descriptor to be retained, even though the 3D geometry has inverted. Therefore, the (S) configuration at C6 becomes an (S) configuration at the new C2 center.\n\n**5.

A new methyl group is added to C6, and the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after workup.\n*   To name the product, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new C1.\n*   Numbering the ring to give the lowest locants to the four methyl groups results in the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This constitutional structure eliminates options B and D, which are named as 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, implying the attack happened at C1. The correct answer must be either A or C.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nThis is the most critical step. We must determine the absolute configuration (R/S) of each chiral center in the product.\n*   **Unaffected Centers (C1, C3, C4):** The configurations of the stereocenters not directly attacked are retained.\n    *   The original C1 was **(R)**. It becomes the new C1, so the product is **(1R)**.\n    *   The original C4 was **(R)**. It becomes the new C4, so the product is **(4R)**.\n    *   The original C3 was **(R)**. It becomes the new C5, so the product is **(5R)**.\n    *   So far, the product is (1R, ? , 4R, 5R)... This is consistent with both options A and C.\n\n*   **Attacked Center (C6):** The reaction causes an inversion of configuration at the site of attack.\n    *   The original C6 had an **(S)** configuration.\n    *   An Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (a Walden inversion). However, the R/S descriptor does not always flip. The descriptor must be reassigned based on the new set of substituents and their Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities.\n    *   A detailed 3D analysis of the anti-diaxial ring opening shows that the incoming methyl group replaces the C-O bond. While the geometry inverts, the change in substituent priorities results in the new stereocenter at C2 also having an **(S)** configuration.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the constitutional and stereochemical analyses:\n*   **Name:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:** (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers and resolving their contradictions.\n\n**1. Analysis of Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with a specific 3D arrangement defined by the (R) and (S) descriptors.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The provided information and general chemical principles establish two critical rules:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack is an Sₙ2-type reaction, which causes an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Determining the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nThe first step is to identify which carbon of the epoxide (C1 or C6) is less sterically hindered.\n*   **Carbon C1** is bonded to a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more hindered than a tertiary one. Therefore, all candidate analyses correctly conclude that the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determining the Product's Constitution and Base Name**\n\nThe attack at C6 and subsequent opening of the epoxide ring determines the product's basic structure.\n*   A methyl group is added to the original C6.\n*   The C6-O bond breaks, and after an aqueous workup (a standard final step), the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups. To name it via IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new C1. Numbering the ring to give the methyl groups the lowest possible locants results in the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This constitutional outcome correctly eliminates options B and C, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol). The final answer must be either A or D.\n\n**4. Determining the Final Stereochemistry**\n\nThis is the most critical step and the source of disagreement among the candidate answers. We must apply the rules of stereochemistry precisely.\n\n*   **Retention at Unreacted Centers:** The configurations at the stereocenters not directly attacked are retained.\n    *   Original C1 (R) becomes new C1 → **(1R)**\n    *   Original C4 (R) becomes new C4 → **(4R)**\n    *   Original C3 (R) becomes new C5 → **(5R)**\n\n*   **Inversion at the Attacked Center:** The reaction causes a geometric inversion at C6. The original configuration is **(6S)**. The key question is whether this geometric inversion results in a new configuration of (R) or (S). This depends on how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n\n    *   **Priorities at Reactant C6:** The groups are -O- (from epoxide), -C1-, -C5-, and -H. The priority order is: **O (1)** > C1 (2) > C5 (3) > H (4).\n    *   **Priorities at Product C2 (from C6):** The groups are -C1- (now with an OH), -C3- (the old C5), the new **-CH₃**, and -H. The priority order is: **C1 (1)** > C3 (2) > **CH₃ (3)** > H (4).\n\n    The Sₙ2 reaction replaces the highest priority group (-O-, rank 1) with a group of lower priority (-CH₃, rank 3). This change in substituent priorities means that a geometric inversion does not automatically lead to an inversion of the R/S descriptor. A careful analysis, as performed correctly by a minority of the candidate answers (e.g., answers 4 and 10), shows that the geometric inversion of the (S) center at C6 results in a new stereocenter at C2 with an **(S)** configuration.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nCombining the stereochemical results, the final product is: **(1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nComparing this to the options:\n*   A) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe correct product is given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product, synthesizing the most accurate points from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with the specified absolute stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is `Me₂CuLi` (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem provides the key rules:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack is an Sₙ2-type reaction, which proceeds with an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\n*   We must compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a quaternary center (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary center (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   The quaternary carbon (C1) is significantly more sterically hindered than the tertiary carbon (C6).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n\n*   The attack on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and is protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product has an -OH group and a methyl group on the original C1 carbon, a new methyl group on the original C6 carbon, and the original methyl groups on the C3 and C4 carbons.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new **C1**.\n*   Numbering the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants results in the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2 (from the attack on C6), 4, and 5.\n*   This constitutional analysis eliminates options B and D, which have the incorrect `2,2,4,5-` substitution pattern. The choice is between A and C.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\n*   The stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) **retain their original configuration**.\n*   The stereocenter that is attacked (C6) undergoes an **inversion of configuration**.\n*   Let's map the stereochemistry from the reactant to the product using the new IUPAC numbering:\n    *   Reactant **C1 (R)** → Product **C1 (R)** (retained)\n    *   Reactant **C4 (R)** → Product **C4 (R)** (retained)\n    *   Reactant **C3 (R)** → Product **C5 (R)** (retained)\n    *   Reactant **C6 (S)** → Product **C2 (inverted)**\n\n*   **The Critical Step: Assigning the R/S descriptor to the new C2.**\n    A simple assumption would be that the inversion of an (S) center leads to an (R) center. However, this is only true if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents do not change their order. In this case, the leaving group (the epoxide oxygen, high priority) is replaced by the incoming nucleophile (a methyl group, lower priority). This change in priorities requires a careful re-evaluation of the R/S configuration from the 3D structure.\n\n*   **3D Analysis:**\n    1.  A detailed analysis of the starting material's stereochemistry `(1R,3R,4R,6S)` shows that the epoxide oxygen and the hydrogen at C6 are on the same face of the ring (e.g., both \"up\" or β).\n    2.  The Sₙ2 attack requires the nucleophile (Me⁻) to approach from the opposite face. So, if the C6-O bond is \"up\", the Me⁻ attacks from \"down\".\n    3.  This attack causes a geometric inversion: the hydrogen at C6, which was \"up\", is pushed \"down\". The new methyl group is now \"down\".\n    4.  Now we assign the CIP configuration to this new C2 center. The substituents are C1(OH), C3, Me, and H. The priorities are: C1 > C3 > Me > H.\n    5.  With the lowest priority group (H) now pointing \"down\" (away from the viewer), we trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (C1 → C3 → Me). This path is counter-clockwise.\n    6.  A counter-clockwise path with the lowest priority group in the back corresponds to an **(S)** configuration.\n\n*   Therefore, despite the geometric inversion, the configuration at C6(S) becomes C2(**S**) due to the change in substituent priorities.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The final product has the following stereochemistry:\n    *   C1: **R**\n    *   C2: **S**\n    *   C4: **R**\n    *   C5: **R**\n*   The full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Principles:** The problem provides the key rules for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction is an Sₙ2-type attack, which causes an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nWe need to compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, not a methyl group, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n\nThe attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. The nucleophilic methyl group is added to C6, and after a standard aqueous workup, a hydroxyl (-OH) group is formed at C1.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new C1. The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   The methyl groups are located at the new C1 (original C1), new C2 (original C6, where the attack occurred), new C4 (original C4), and new C5 (original C3).\n    *   This gives the locant set {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n*   The product is therefore a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This constitutional structure eliminates options A and B, which are named as 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (implying attack at C1). The choice is between C and D.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nThe reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked center (C6) and retention of configuration at the other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4).\n*   **Configuration at C1:** Retained. It was (R) and remains **(R)**.\n*   **Configuration at C3:** Retained. It was (R). In the new numbering, this is C5, so it is **(5R)**.\n*   **Configuration at C4:** Retained. It was (R) and remains **(4R)**.\n*   **Configuration at C6:** Inverted. It was (S). The Sₙ2 attack inverts the stereocenter to **(R)**. In the new numbering, this is C2, so it is **(2R)**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the constitutional name and the stereochemical descriptors, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nComparing this to the remaining options:\n*   C) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe correct product matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a detailed, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, and the absolute stereochemistry at these four chiral centers is specified.\n*   **Reagent:** `Me₂CuLi` (Lithium dimethylcuprate), known as a Gilman reagent, provides a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate. The provided rules are standard for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack is an Sₙ2-type reaction, which causes an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nWe must compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is part of the epoxide and is also substituted with a methyl group. This makes C1 a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to the epoxide oxygen, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is also part of the epoxide but is bonded to a hydrogen atom instead of a methyl group. This makes C6 a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to the epoxide oxygen, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the methyl nucleophile will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n\nThe attack on C6 opens the epoxide ring. After a standard aqueous workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with the original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, plus a new methyl group at C6.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new **C1**.\n*   We then number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1 (original C1) towards the newly substituted carbon (original C6) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering clockwise would give the locant set {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n*   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower. Therefore, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and D, which have a different substitution pattern (`2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...`) that would result from an attack at C1.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nThis is the most critical step. We apply the Sₙ2 rule of inversion.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The configurations of the stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) are retained.\n    *   Original C1(R) → New C1(R)\n    *   Original C4(R) → New C4(R)\n    *   Original C3(R) → New C5(R)\n*   **Attacked Center:** The configuration at C6 is inverted.\n    *   Original C6 has an (S) configuration.\n    *   The Sₙ2 attack causes a geometric inversion at this center. However, we must be careful. An inversion of the 3D arrangement does not automatically mean the R/S descriptor flips. The descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the new substituents.\n    *   Let's analyze the change at C6 (which becomes C2):\n        *   **At reactant C6:** The groups are O, C1, C5, H. The priorities are O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4). The configuration is (S).\n        *   **At product C2:** The groups are C1, C3, Me, H. The priorities are C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4).\n    *   The Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (a Walden inversion). The leaving group (O, priority 1) is replaced by the incoming nucleophile (Me, priority 3). Due to this significant change in priorities, a geometric inversion of the (S) center results in a new center that is also designated as **(S)**.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at the new C2 is **(S)**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the constitutional and stereochemical analyses:\n*   **Name:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:** (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.

The problem provides the key rules for this specific reaction.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n*   The first rule given is: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6.\n*   We must compare the steric hindrance at these two carbons.\n    *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a more sterically hindered tertiary carbon center.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a hydrogen atom, making it a less sterically hindered tertiary carbon center.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n*   The attack at C6 adds a methyl group to that carbon. The epoxide ring opens, and after an aqueous workup (a standard step to quench the reaction and protonate the intermediate), a hydroxyl (-OH) group is formed at C1.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups. To name it according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1. The ring is then numbered to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   The methyl groups are located at the original C1, C3, C4, and the newly added one at C6.\n    *   Numbering from the new C1 (original C1) towards the newly substituted carbon (original C6) gives the locant set {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n*   The constitutional name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options A and B, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-), which would result from an attack at C1.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n*   The second rule given is: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   The nucleophilic attack occurs at C6, which has an initial configuration of **(S)**.\n*   The Sₙ2 attack causes an inversion of this stereocenter. Therefore, the configuration at this carbon in the product will be **(R)**.\n*   The other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly involved in the substitution reaction, so their configurations are retained.\n*   Now, we map the stereochemistry from the reactant to the product using the new IUPAC numbering:\n    *   **New C1** (from original C1): Configuration is retained → **(1R)**\n    *   **New C2** (from original C6): Configuration is inverted (S → R) → **(2R)**\n    *   **New C4** (from original C4): Configuration is retained → **(4R)**\n    *   **New C5** (from original C3): Configuration is retained → **(5R)**\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n*   Combining the constitutional name and the stereochemistry, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product, synthesizing the most accurate points from the provided answers and correcting any inconsistencies.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Starting Material and Reagents**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n**2. Regioselectivity: Where does the attack occur?**\n\nThe problem states that the organocuprate attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n*   **C1** is a **quaternary** carbon because it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to the epoxide oxygen and two other ring carbons.\n*   **C6** is a **tertiary** carbon because it is bonded to a hydrogen atom, the epoxide oxygen, and two other ring carbons.\n*   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic attack by the methyl group will occur at **C6**.\n\nThis conclusion allows us to determine the basic structure (constitution) of the product. The attack adds a methyl group to C6 and creates a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1. When renumbered according to IUPAC rules, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and D, which have a 2,2,4,5- substitution pattern that would result from an attack at C1.\n\n**3. Stereoselectivity: How does the attack occur?**\n\nThe problem states that the reaction causes an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon where the nucleophile is added. This is the hallmark of an Sₙ2 reaction, where the nucleophile performs a \"backside attack\" opposite to the C-O bond.\n\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) will **retain** their original configurations.\n    *   C1 remains **(R)**.\n    *   C3 remains **(R)**.\n    *   C4 remains **(R)**.\n*   **Attacked Center (C6):** The configuration at C6, which is **(S)** in the starting material, will be inverted.\n\n**4. The Critical Point: Does S invert to R?**\n\nA simple assumption would be that inverting an (S) center automatically makes it (R). However, this is not always true because the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents changes during the reaction.\n\n*   **At reactant C6:** The leaving group is the epoxide oxygen, which has the highest priority (1).\n*   **At product C2 (the new name for the C6 carbon):** The incoming group is a methyl group, which has a lower priority than the adjacent ring carbons.\n*   A careful analysis of the CIP priorities before and after the geometric inversion reveals that the descriptor for the inverted center remains **(S)**. The spatial arrangement of the atoms is indeed inverted, but the label assigned by the CIP rules does not change from S to R.\n*   Therefore, the configuration at the new C2 is **(S)**.\n\n**5. Assembling the Final Product Name**\n\nWe combine the IUPAC numbering with the stereochemical analysis:\n*   The product name is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   The stereochemistry is:\n    *   **New C1** (from original C1): Retained as **(R)**.\n    *   **New C2** (from original C6): Inverted, resulting in **(S)**.\n    *   **New C4** (from original C4): Retained as **(R)**.\n    *   **New C5** (from original C3): Retained as **(R)**.\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product based on the provided information and chemical principles.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It is substituted with methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\nThe problem states a key rule: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to four non-hydrogen atoms: O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to three non-hydrogen atoms: O, C1, and C5).\n*   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\nThis regioselectivity means the product will have a hydroxyl group at C1 and a new methyl group at C6. When renumbered according to IUPAC rules, the product will be a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options A and D, which have a different substitution pattern (`2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...`) that would result from an attack at C1. The correct answer must be either B or C.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereoselectivity**\n\nThe problem states the second key rule: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is the defining characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   The nucleophilic attack occurs at carbon C6.\n*   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(S)**.\n*   The Sₙ2 mechanism causes a Walden inversion at this center. The most direct interpretation of this rule is that the stereochemical descriptor flips. Therefore, the (S) configuration at C6 becomes an **(R)** configuration in the product.\n*   The other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly attacked, so their configurations are retained.\n\n**4. Assemble the Final Product's Name**\n\nWe combine the regiochemical and stereochemical outcomes and map them to the new IUPAC numbering of the product:\n*   **Numbering:** The carbon with the -OH group (original C1) becomes the new C1. The adjacent carbon that was attacked (original C6) becomes the new C2. The original C4 becomes the new C4, and the original C3 becomes the new C5.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **New C1** (from original C1): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n    *   **New C2** (from original C6): Configuration is inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n    *   **New C4** (from original C4): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n    *   **New C5** (from original C3): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n\nThe full name of the resulting product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n\nComparing this result to the remaining options:\n*   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur derived product matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with the specified absolute stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The prompt provides the key rules for this specific reaction.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\n*   The first rule states that the alkyl group of the organocuprate is introduced at the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n*   **C1** is a **quaternary** carbon because it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to the other ring carbons (C2 and C6) and the epoxide oxygen.\n*   **C6** is a **tertiary** carbon because it is bonded to a hydrogen atom, two ring carbons (C1 and C5), and the epoxide oxygen.\n*   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\nThis regioselectivity means the resulting product will be a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. The attack at C6 places the new methyl group on the carbon adjacent (C2 in the product) to the carbon that will bear the hydroxyl group (C1 in the product). This immediately eliminates options A and D, which are 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol isomers that would result from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either B or C.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereoselectivity**\n\n*   The second rule states that **inversion of configuration** occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction mechanism.\n*   The attack occurs at C6, which has an initial configuration of **(S)**.\n*   The other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4) are not directly attacked and therefore **retain** their original configurations: (1R), (3R), and (4R).\n*   The crucial step is to determine the final configuration of the attacked carbon. While the Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (a \"Walden inversion\"), the resulting R/S descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the new substituent compared to the old one. A simple flip of the letter (S → R) is not guaranteed. A careful analysis is required.\n\n**4. Detailed Stereochemical Analysis**\n\n1.  **Starting Material 3D Structure:** For (1R,3R,4R,6S), a consistent 3D representation places the epoxide oxygen and the C1-methyl group on the same face of the ring (cis, let's call this \"up\" or β), while the hydrogen at C6 is on the opposite face (\"down\" or α).\n2.  **Backside Attack:** Since the C6-O bond is \"up\", the nucleophilic methyl group must attack from the \"down\" side (the α face) to achieve the required backside attack.\n3.  **Geometric Inversion:** The original hydrogen at C6, which was \"down\", is pushed \"up\" by the incoming nucleophile. The new methyl group is now attached to the \"down\" face.\n4.  **Assigning the New Configuration:** We now assign the R/S configuration to the product's C2 (which was the original C6).\n    *   The groups attached are H (\"up\"), the new Me (\"down\"), C1, and C3.\n    *   The CIP priorities are: C1 > C3 > new Me > H.\n    *   With the lowest priority group (H) pointing towards the viewer (\"up\"/wedge), we trace the path from priority 1 (C1) to 2 (C3) to 3 (Me). This path is clockwise.\n    *   According to CIP rules, a clockwise path when the lowest priority group is pointing towards the viewer corresponds to an **(S)** configuration.\n5.  **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The geometric inversion at the C6(S) center results in a product with a C2(S) configuration. The descriptor does not change in this specific case.\n\n**5. Final Product Assembly**\n\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   C1 retains its configuration: **(1R)**\n    *   C2 (from C6) has its configuration determined as **(2S)**.\n    *   C4 retains its configuration: **(4R)**\n    *   C5 (from C3) retains its configuration: **(5R)**\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
