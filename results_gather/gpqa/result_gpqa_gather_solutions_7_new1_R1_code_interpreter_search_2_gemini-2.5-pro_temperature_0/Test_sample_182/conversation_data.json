Analyze the Reactant\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's identify its key structural features that contribute to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This indicates a six-membered ring (IHD = 1) with one C=C double bond (IHD = 1).\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This group contains a C=O double bond (IHD = 1).\n*   **formyl (-CHO)**: This group contains a C=O double bond (IHD = 1).\n*   **vinyl (-CH=CH₂)**: This group contains a C=C double bond (IHD = 1).\nThe total IHD of the reactant is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Reaction\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus and excess of HI**. This is a very powerful reducing agent known for complete reduction. It will:\n*   Reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   Reduce all oxygen-containing functional groups (like aldehydes and carboxylic acids) completely to their corresponding alkane forms. Specifically, both -CHO and -COOH groups are reduced to -CH₃ groups.\n*   Crucially, this reaction does not break the ring structure.\n\n### 3. Determine the Product\nThe reaction transforms the starting material into a fully saturated hydrocarbon while preserving the carbon skeleton.\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group.\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a saturated molecule containing a single ring.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe IHD is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Number of rings**: The product retains the six-membered ring, so there is **1** ring.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: The complete reduction eliminates all C=C and C=O double bonds. Therefore, the number of π bonds is **0**.\n\nThe IHD of the product is calculated as:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the molecular formula. The reactant has 10 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 1 in COOH, 1 in CHO, 2 in vinyl). The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (cycloalkane) with 10 carbons. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. Thus, the product's formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\nUsing the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\n### Conclusion\nAll valid chemical reasoning points to an IHD of 1 for the product. This corresponds to the single ring remaining after the complete reduction.

Analyze the Reactant's Structure and Carbon Skeleton**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n*   The core structure is a six-carbon ring (`cyclohex`).\n*   There is a one-carbon substituent from the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`).\n*   There is a one-carbon substituent from the formyl group (`-CHO`).\n*   There is a two-carbon substituent from the vinyl group (`-CH=CH₂`).\n\nThe total number of carbon atoms in the molecule is 6 (ring) + 1 (acid) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) = **10 carbons**.\n\n**2. Understand the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. It is crucial to know that it will reduce multiple types of functional groups completely.\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It reduces oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to their corresponding alkane parts. Both -CHO and -COOH are reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Careful Point 2:** This reaction preserves the carbon skeleton. The ring structure is not broken, and no carbon atoms are lost.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Structure and Molecular Formula**\n\nThe reaction transforms the reactant as follows:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C bond is saturated).\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group.\n\nThe final product is a fully saturated hydrocarbon that contains a single ring.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** Since the product is a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) and retains all 10 original carbon atoms, its molecular formula must follow the general formula for cycloalkanes, which is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, represents the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **Method 1: Analysis of the Structure**\n    The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It has **one ring** and, being fully saturated, **zero π bonds**.\n    IHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of π Bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the Molecular Formula**\n    The IHD can be calculated from the molecular formula (C₁₀H₂₀) using the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n    IHD = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1. This single degree of unsaturation is due to the presence of the cyclohexane ring.

The other agents, despite performing the correct chemical analysis, made an error in selecting the final option. For example, many chose A (5), which is the IHD of the *reactant*, not the product. Others chose C (0), which would be the IHD for an *acyclic* saturated alkane.

Analysis of the Chemical Problem**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of a product from a specific chemical reaction.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Task:** Find the IHD of the final product.\n\n**2. Consensus on the Chemical Reasoning**\n\nAll 15 candidate answers demonstrate a remarkable consensus on the chemical principles and the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n*   **Step A: Understanding the Reactant:** All agents correctly identify the key structural features of the reactant: a six-membered ring, a C=C double bond within the ring, a vinyl group (containing another C=C double bond), a formyl group (containing a C=O double bond), and a carboxylic acid group (containing a C=O double bond). They correctly deduce that the carbon skeleton contains 10 carbon atoms.\n\n*   **Step B: Understanding the Reaction:** All agents correctly identify that Red P + excess HI is a powerful reducing agent. They agree that this reagent will reduce all points of unsaturation (all C=C and C=O double bonds) and remove all oxygen atoms, converting the molecule into a saturated hydrocarbon.\n\n*   **Step C: Determining the Product:** All agents correctly conclude that the reaction does not break the carbon ring. Therefore, the product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane) with the same 10-carbon skeleton as the reactant.\n\n*   **Step D: Calculating the IHD of the Product:** All agents correctly use one or both of the following methods to find the IHD of the product:\n    1.  **Structural Method:** The product has one ring and zero pi (π) bonds. Therefore, IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n    2.  **Formula Method:** A monocyclic alkane with 'n' carbons has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. For the C₁₀ product, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀. The IHD is calculated as IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 1.\n\nEvery single candidate answer correctly concludes that the numerical value of the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the product is **1**.\n\n**3.

This is a six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n*   **Substituents**:\n    *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): Contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   `formyl` (-CHO): Contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   `vinyl` (-CH=CH₂): Contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n*   **Careful Point 1**: The question asks for the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the *product*, not the reactant. Calculating the IHD of the reactant is a common mistake. For reference, the reactant's IHD is 5 (1 for the ring, 1 for the C=C in the ring, 1 for the C=C in the vinyl group, 1 for the C=O in the formyl group, and 1 for the C=O in the acid group).

It performs a *complete* reduction of the molecule to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   **Effect**:\n    *   All carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   All oxygen-containing functional groups (aldehydes, carboxylic acids) are completely reduced, and the oxygen atoms are removed. Both the -CHO and -COOH groups are reduced to methyl (-CH₃) groups.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product\n*   **Careful Point 3**: The reaction preserves the carbon skeleton, including the ring structure.

It is a substituted cyclohexane.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Number of Rings**: The product retains the single cyclohexane ring. So, the number of rings is 1.\n*   **Number of π Bonds**: The complete reduction eliminates all C=C and C=O double bonds. Therefore, the number of π bonds is 0.\n*   **Careful Point 4**: The IHD of the product is calculated based on its final structure.\n    IHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of π Bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe single degree of unsaturation in the product is due to the presence of the ring.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis consistently shows that the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the final product is 1.

Analyze the Reactant\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's identify its key structural features that contribute to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This indicates a six-membered ring (IHD = 1) with one C=C double bond (IHD = 1).\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This group contains a C=O double bond (IHD = 1).\n*   **formyl (-CHO)**: This group contains a C=O double bond (IHD = 1).\n*   **vinyl (-CH=CH₂)**: This group contains a C=C double bond (IHD = 1).\nThe total IHD of the reactant is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Reaction\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus and excess of HI**. This is a very powerful reducing agent known for complete reduction. It will:\n*   Reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   Reduce all oxygen-containing functional groups (like aldehydes and carboxylic acids) completely to their corresponding alkane forms. Specifically, both -CHO and -COOH groups are reduced to -CH₃ groups.\n*   Crucially, this reaction does not break the ring structure.\n\n### 3. Determine the Product\nThe reaction transforms the starting material into a fully saturated hydrocarbon while preserving the carbon skeleton.\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group.\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a saturated molecule containing a single ring.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe IHD is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Number of rings**: The product retains the six-membered ring, so there is **1** ring.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: The complete reduction eliminates all C=C and C=O double bonds. Therefore, the number of π bonds is **0**.\n\nThe IHD of the product is calculated as:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the molecular formula. The reactant has 10 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 1 in COOH, 1 in CHO, 2 in vinyl). The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (cycloalkane) with 10 carbons. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. Thus, the product's formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\nUsing the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\n### Conclusion\nAll valid chemical reasoning points to an IHD of 1 for the product. This corresponds to the single ring remaining after the complete reduction.

Analyze the Reactant's Structure and Carbon Skeleton**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n*   The core structure is a six-carbon ring (`cyclohex`).\n*   There is a one-carbon substituent from the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`).\n*   There is a one-carbon substituent from the formyl group (`-CHO`).\n*   There is a two-carbon substituent from the vinyl group (`-CH=CH₂`).\n\nThe total number of carbon atoms in the molecule is 6 (ring) + 1 (acid) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) = **10 carbons**.\n\n**2. Understand the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. It is crucial to know that it will reduce multiple types of functional groups completely.\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It reduces oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to their corresponding alkane parts. Both -CHO and -COOH are reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Careful Point 2:** This reaction preserves the carbon skeleton. The ring structure is not broken, and no carbon atoms are lost.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Structure and Molecular Formula**\n\nThe reaction transforms the reactant as follows:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C bond is saturated).\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group.\n\nThe final product is a fully saturated hydrocarbon that contains a single ring.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** Since the product is a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) and retains all 10 original carbon atoms, its molecular formula must follow the general formula for cycloalkanes, which is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, represents the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **Method 1: Analysis of the Structure**\n    The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It has **one ring** and, being fully saturated, **zero π bonds**.\n    IHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of π Bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the Molecular Formula**\n    The IHD can be calculated from the molecular formula (C₁₀H₂₀) using the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n    IHD = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.

Let's identify its key structural features that contribute to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), which is the sum of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n*   **cyclohex-**: There is one six-membered ring (IHD contribution = 1).\n*   **-3-ene**: There is one C=C double bond within the ring (IHD contribution = 1).\n*   **vinyl**: The -CH=CH₂ group contains one C=C double bond (IHD contribution = 1).\n*   **formyl**: The -CHO group contains one C=O double bond (IHD contribution = 1).\n*   **carboxylic acid**: The -COOH group contains one C=O double bond (IHD contribution = 1).\n\nThe total IHD of the starting material is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n**2.

Consensus on the Chemical Reasoning**\n\nAll 15 candidate answers demonstrate a remarkable consensus on the chemical principles and the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n*   **Step A: Understanding the Reactant:** All agents correctly identify the key structural features of the reactant: a six-membered ring, a C=C double bond within the ring, a vinyl group (containing another C=C double bond), a formyl group (containing a C=O double bond), and a carboxylic acid group (containing a C=O double bond). They correctly deduce that the carbon skeleton contains 10 carbon atoms.\n\n*   **Step B: Understanding the Reaction:** All agents correctly identify that Red P + excess HI is a powerful reducing agent. They agree that this reagent will reduce all points of unsaturation (all C=C and C=O double bonds) and remove all oxygen atoms, converting the molecule into a saturated hydrocarbon.\n\n*   **Step C: Determining the Product:** All agents correctly conclude that the reaction does not break the carbon ring. Therefore, the product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane) with the same 10-carbon skeleton as the reactant.\n\n*   **Step D: Calculating the IHD of the Product:** All agents correctly use one or both of the following methods to find the IHD of the product:\n    1.  **Structural Method:** The product has one ring and zero pi (π) bonds.
