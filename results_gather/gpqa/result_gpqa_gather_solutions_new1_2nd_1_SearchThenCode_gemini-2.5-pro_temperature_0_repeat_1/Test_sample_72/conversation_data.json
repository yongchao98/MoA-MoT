Here, c is the speed of light. What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?\n\nA) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\nB) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nC) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nD) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nThe Python script correctly calculated the physical quantities for the problem.\n-   **Calculated Relative Speed:** `v_rel ≈ 0.1429c`\n-   **Calculated Total Energy:** `E ≈ 5.9641 mc²`\n\nThe script's automated filtering failed to find a match because the relative tolerance (`rel_tol=0.01`) was too strict for the velocity comparison. The difference between the calculated value `0.1429` and the option's rounded value `0.14` is approximately 2%, which is greater than the 1% tolerance.\n\nHowever, a manual inspection of the results clearly shows which option is correct.

Analysis of the Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem involves objects moving at relativistic speeds (significant fractions of the speed of light, c). Therefore, the principles of special relativity must be used, not classical mechanics.\n\n*   **Relative Velocity:** The relative velocity between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is not a simple subtraction of their velocities. The correct formula is the Lorentz transformation for velocities.\n*   **Total Energy:** The energy of a moving object is its total relativistic energy, which includes both its rest energy and its kinetic energy. The total energy of the system is the sum of the total relativistic energies of its components (the two astronauts), assuming they are non-interacting.\n\n### **2. Calculation of Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\n**Careful Point:** Use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula for objects moving in the same direction.\nThe formula is:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nGiven:\n*   `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   `v2 = 0.5c`\n\nCalculation:\n1.  `v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n2.  `v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)`\n3.  `v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n4.  `v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n5.  `v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n### **3. Calculation of Total Energy (E_total)**\n\n**Careful Point:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual *total relativistic energies* (`E = γmc²`), not just their rest energies or classical kinetic energies.\n\nThe formula for total relativistic energy is `E = γmc²`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n**a) Energy of the first astronaut (E1):**\n*   Mass `m1 = 2m`\n*   Velocity `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ1`:\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Calculate the energy `E1`:\n    `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n**b) Energy of the second astronaut (E2):**\n*   Mass `m2 = 3m`\n*   Velocity `v2 = 0.5c`\n*   Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ2`:\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Calculate the energy `E2`:\n    `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²`\n\n**c) Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\n*   `E_total = E1 + E2`\n*   `E_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc²`\n*   `E_total = 5.964 mc²`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **4. Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   Total energy `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²`\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc²\n*   B) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc²\n*   C) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc²\n*   D) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc²\n\nThe calculated values precisely match option D. The majority of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but made errors in matching their result to the correct letter option.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1.

We must use the Lorentz transformation for velocities (also known as the relativistic velocity subtraction formula).\n2.  **Total Energy (`E_total`)**: The energy of a moving object at relativistic speeds is its total energy, which includes its rest energy. The formula is `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor. The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Relative Speed\n\nThe formula for the relative speed of two objects moving in the same direction with velocities `v₁` and `v₂` is:\n`v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)`\n\nGiven:\n*   `v₁ = 0.6c`\n*   `v₂ = 0.5c`\n\nCalculation:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, **`v_rel ≈ 0.14c`**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Energy\n\nThe total energy of the system is `E_total = E₁ + E₂`.\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut (`E₁`):**\n*   Mass `m₁ = 2m`\n*   Velocity `v₁ = 0.6c`\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ₁`:\n    `γ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v₁/c)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.6²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Now, calculate the energy `E₁`:\n    `E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut (`E₂`):**\n*   Mass `m₂ = 3m`\n*   Velocity `v₂ = 0.5c`\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v₂/c)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.5²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Now, calculate the energy `E₂`:\n    `E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²`\n\n**Total Energy of the System (`E_total`):**\n*   `E_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = 5.964 mc²`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, **`E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²`**.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Analyze Candidate Answers\n\nOur calculated values are `v_rel ≈ 0.14c` and `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²`. Let's compare this to the given options:\n*   A) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n*   B) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n*   C) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n*   D) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match **Option D**.\n\n**Analysis of Candidate Answers:**\nA review of the 15 candidate answers shows a strong consensus on the calculated values. Nearly all agents correctly derive `v_rel ≈ 0.14c` and `E ≈ 5.96 mc²`. However, many of them incorrectly map these results to the option letters (A, B, or C), likely due to a scrambled list of options in their own processing. The agents that perform the calculation and the final matching step correctly (e.g., Answers 12 and 13) arrive at option D. The overwhelming consensus on the *physics calculation* points directly to the values in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Calculation of the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\n**Careful Point:** Since the astronauts are traveling at relativistic speeds (significant fractions of the speed of light, c), we cannot simply subtract their velocities. We must use the Einstein velocity subtraction formula for objects moving in the same direction.\n\nThe formula is:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nGiven:\n*   `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   `v2 = 0.5c`\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel ≈ 0.142857c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n### **2. Calculation of the Total Energy (E_total)**\n\n**Careful Point:** The total energy of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is its total relativistic energy, not just its kinetic or rest energy. The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts.\n\nThe formula for the total relativistic energy of a single particle is:\n`E = γmc^2`\nwhere `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut (E1):**\n*   Mass `m1 = 2m`\n*   Velocity `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ1`:\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Now, calculate the energy `E1`:\n    `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut (E2):**\n*   Mass `m2 = 3m`\n*   Velocity `v2 = 0.5c`\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ2`:\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Now, calculate the energy `E2`:\n    `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2 ≈ 3.464 mc^2`\n\n**Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\n*   `E_total = E1 + E2`\n*   `E_total = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   Total energy `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc^2`\n\nThese calculated values precisely match option D. Most of the provided candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed to map their result to the correct lettered option.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1.

Careful Points and Formulas**\n\n*   **Relative Speed:** At speeds close to the speed of light, we cannot simply subtract the velocities. The correct formula is the relativistic velocity subtraction (a form of the Lorentz transformation):\n    `v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)`\n    This is crucial because a simple subtraction (`0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c`) would give an incorrect result, as seen in option B.\n\n*   **Total Energy:** The energy of a relativistic particle is not its classical kinetic energy. The total energy includes its rest energy.

Calculation of Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Since the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light (c), we cannot simply subtract them (0.6c - 0.5c). We must use the formula for relativistic velocity subtraction, which is derived from the Lorentz transformations.

Calculation of Total Energy (E_total)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The total energy of a particle moving at relativistic speed is not its classical kinetic energy but its total relativistic energy, which includes its rest energy. The formula is `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor. The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts.\n\n*   **Lorentz Factor (γ) Calculation:** The Lorentz factor depends on the particle's speed and is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 1:**\n    *   Mass (m₁) = 2m, Velocity (v₁) = 0.6c\n    *   `γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n    *   `E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 2:**\n    *   Mass (m₂) = 3m, Velocity (v₂) = 0.5c\n    *   `γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n    *   `E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²`\n\n*   **Total System Energy:**\n    *   `E_total = E₁ + E₂ ≈ 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = 5.964 mc²`\n\n    Rounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed (v_rel) ≈ **0.14c**\n*   Total energy (E_total) ≈ **5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n*   B) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n*   C) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n*   D) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n\nThe calculated values precisely match option C.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, including all the careful points required to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Physics Problem**\n\nThe question asks for two distinct physical quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\n1.  The **relative speed** (`v_rel`) between the two astronauts.\n2.  The **total energy** (`E_total`) of the system as measured by a stationary observer.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Relativistic vs. Classical Formulas:** The speeds (0.6c and 0.5c) are a significant fraction of the speed of light. Therefore, formulas from Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity are mandatory. Using classical formulas like simple velocity subtraction or classical kinetic energy will lead to incorrect results.\n2.  **Velocity Subtraction Formula:** For two objects moving in the same direction, the relativistic relative speed is not a simple subtraction. The correct formula is `v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁v₂)/c²)`.\n3.  **Total Relativistic Energy:** The question asks for the *total energy*, which is given by `E = γmc²`. This formula accounts for both the rest energy of the particle and its kinetic energy. It is not just the kinetic energy.\n4.  **Sum of Individual Energies:** The total energy of the system is the simple sum of the individual total energies of the two non-interacting astronauts: `E_total = E₁ + E₂`.\n5.  **Individual Lorentz Factors:** The Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`, depends on velocity. Since the two astronauts have different velocities, their Lorentz factors must be calculated separately.\n6.  **Use Correct Masses:** The astronauts have different masses (`2m` and `3m`). These specific masses must be used when calculating the energy for each astronaut.\n7.  **Final Matching:** As seen in the candidate answers, a common error is correctly calculating the values but then matching them to the wrong lettered option. A final, careful comparison with the provided options is crucial.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**1. Calculation of Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nUsing the relativistic velocity subtraction formula:\n`v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)`\n\nSubstitute the given values `v₁ = 0.6c` and `v₂ = 0.5c`:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c²/c²)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**2. Calculation of Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is `E_total = E₁ + E₂`. We must first calculate the energy of each astronaut.\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut (E₁):**\n*   Mass `m₁ = 2m`, velocity `v₁ = 0.6c`\n*   First, calculate its Lorentz factor (`γ₁`):\n    `γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √0.64 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Now, calculate its energy (`E₁`):\n    `E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut (E₂):**\n*   Mass `m₂ = 3m`, velocity `v₂ = 0.5c`\n*   First, calculate its Lorentz factor (`γ₂`):\n    `γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √0.75 ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Now, calculate its energy (`E₂`):\n    `E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²`\n\n**Total System Energy (E_total):**\n*   Sum the individual energies:\n    `E_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = 5.964 mc²`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe final calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   Total energy `E ≈ 5.96 mc²`\n\nComparing these results with the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2**\n*   B) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n*   C) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n*   D) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

The vast majority of agents correctly calculate the physical quantities but fail to map them to the correct option letter as presented in the prompt. A step-by-step verification is necessary to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nThe problem requires calculating two distinct physical quantities: the relative speed and the total energy of the system.\n\n**1. Calculation of Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Use Relativistic Formulas.** The speeds (0.6c and 0.5c) are a significant fraction of the speed of light, so classical velocity subtraction (`0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c`) is incorrect. The Einstein velocity subtraction formula must be used.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Correct Formula.** For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities `v₁` and `v₂`, the relative speed is `v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - v₁v₂/c²)`.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   `v₁ = 0.6c`\n    *   `v₂ = 0.5c`\n    *   `v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)`\n    *   `v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n    *   `v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n    *   `v_rel ≈ 0.142857... c`\n\n    Rounding to two decimal places, **v_rel ≈ 0.14c**.\n\n**2. Calculation of Total Energy (E_total)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Total Energy, Not Kinetic.** The question asks for the *total* relativistic energy (`E = γmc²`), which includes rest energy, not just the kinetic energy.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Sum of Individual Energies.** The total energy of the system is the simple sum of the total energies of the two non-interacting astronauts (`E_total = E₁ + E₂`).\n*   **Careful Point 5: Separate Lorentz Factors.** Each astronaut has a different velocity, so their Lorentz factor (`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`) must be calculated individually.\n*   **Careful Point 6: Use Correct Masses.** The astronauts have different masses (`2m` and `3m`), which must be used in their respective energy calculations.\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 1 (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):**\n    *   `γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √0.64 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n    *   `E₁ = γ₁ * (2m) * c² = 1.25 * 2mc² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 2 (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):**\n    *   `γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √0.75 ≈ 1.1547`\n    *   `E₂ = γ₂ * (3m) * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3mc² ≈ 3.464 mc²`\n\n*   **Calculation for Total System Energy:**\n    *   `E_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = 5.964 mc²`\n\n    Rounding to two decimal places, **E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative Speed: **≈ 0.14c**\n*   Total Energy: **≈ 5.96 mc²**\n\nNow, we compare these results to the options provided in the question:\n*   A) v_rel = 0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2  (Incorrect `v_rel` and `E`)\n*   B) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2          (Correct `v_rel`, but incorrect `E`)\n*   C) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2  **(Correct `v_rel` and `E`)**\n*   D) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2          (Incorrect `v_rel` and `E`; relative speed cannot exceed `c`)\n\nThe calculated values precisely match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

Step-by-Step Calculation and Careful Points**\n\n**Part A: Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Use the Correct Velocity Formula.** Since the speeds are relativistic (i.e., a significant fraction of the speed of light, `c`), we cannot use the simple classical subtraction (`v₁ - v₂`). We must use the Einstein relativistic velocity subtraction formula for objects moving in the same direction:\n    `v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)`\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    `v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)`\n    `v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c²/c²)`\n    `v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n    `v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n    `v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.142857... c`\n\n*   **Result for Relative Speed:** Rounding to two decimal places, `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n**Part B: Calculate the Total Energy (E_total)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Use the Total Relativistic Energy Formula.** The question asks for the *total energy*, not just kinetic energy. The total energy of a single relativistic particle is `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Sum Individual Energies.** The total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the individual, non-interacting astronauts: `E_total = E₁ + E₂`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ) for Each Astronaut.** The Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`, depends on the velocity, so it must be calculated separately for each astronaut.\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 1 (E₁):**\n    *   `γ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)²)` = `1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)` = `1 / sqrt(0.64)` = `1 / 0.8` = `1.25`\n    *   `E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c²` = `1.25 * (2m) * c²` = `2.5 mc²`\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 2 (E₂):**\n    *   `γ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)²)` = `1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)` = `1 / sqrt(0.75)` ≈ `1 / 0.8660` ≈ `1.1547`\n    *   `E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c²` ≈ `1.1547 * (3m) * c²` ≈ `3.4641 mc²`\n\n*   **Calculation for Total Energy (E_total):**\n    *   `E_total = E₁ + E₂` = `2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc²` = `5.9641 mc²`\n\n*   **Result for Total Energy:** Rounding to two decimal places, `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²`.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative Speed: `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   Total Energy: `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²`\n\nThese values perfectly match option A.

Calculation of Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Since the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light (c), we cannot simply subtract them (0.6c - 0.5c). We must use the formula for relativistic velocity subtraction, which is derived from the Lorentz transformations. For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities v₁ and v₂, the relative speed is:\n    `v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)`\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   v₁ = 0.6c\n    *   v₂ = 0.5c\n    *   `v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²) `\n    *   `v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7`\n    *   `v_rel ≈ 0.1428c`\n\n    Rounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**2. Calculation of Total Energy (E_total)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The total energy of a particle moving at relativistic speed is not its classical kinetic energy but its total relativistic energy, which includes its rest energy. The formula is `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor. The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts.\n\n*   **Lorentz Factor (γ) Calculation:** The Lorentz factor depends on the particle's speed and is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 1:**\n    *   Mass (m₁) = 2m, Velocity (v₁) = 0.6c\n    *   `γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n    *   `E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 2:**\n    *   Mass (m₂) = 3m, Velocity (v₂) = 0.5c\n    *   `γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n    *   `E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²`\n\n*   **Total System Energy:**\n    *   `E_total = E₁ + E₂ ≈ 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = 5.964 mc²`\n\n    Rounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed (v_rel) ≈ **0.14c**\n*   Total energy (E_total) ≈ **5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n*   B) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n*   C) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n*   D) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n\nThe calculated values precisely match option C.
