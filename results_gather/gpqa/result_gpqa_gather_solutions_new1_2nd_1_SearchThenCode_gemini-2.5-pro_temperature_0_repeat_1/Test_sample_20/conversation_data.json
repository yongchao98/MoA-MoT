  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nCompounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).\n\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nThe Python script successfully solved the problem by following the plan of enumerating and pruning hypotheses.\n\n1.  **Hypothesis Generation:** The script began by creating four candidate hypotheses, one for each multiple-choice option (A, B, C, D).\n2.  **Constraint 1 (Tautomerism):** The first constraint required identifying the compound (A) that does *not* show tautomerism. The script correctly determined that benzoquinone lacks the necessary alpha-hydrogens for tautomerization, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize. This step pruned hypotheses A and B.\n3.  **Constraint 2 (Optical Isomerism):** The second constraint required identifying the compound (B) that *does* show optical isomerism. The script correctly identified that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral carbon and is therefore optically active, whereas dimethyl fumarate is not. This step pruned hypothesis D from the remaining candidates.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The only hypothesis that satisfied both constraints was C. The script correctly identified this as the final choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part A: Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound that does **not** show tautomerism. The key concept here is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen).\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** Its structure is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups (C=O) and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized and do not have any attached hydrogen atoms that can participate in tautomerization. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Its structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are sp³ hybridized and each has two α-hydrogens. The presence of these α-hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is particularly stable because it is aromatic. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound that **will** show optical isomerism. This requires the molecule to be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups in a *trans* configuration. The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part A: Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound that does **not** show tautomerism. The key concept here is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen).\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups (C=O) and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized and do not have the type of alpha-hydrogens (on an sp³ carbon) required for typical keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion of benzoquinone to its corresponding diol (hydroquinone) is a reduction-oxidation reaction, not tautomerism, as the molecular formulas are different (C₆H₄O₂ vs. C₆H₆O₂).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons between the carbonyls are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These methylene groups contain hydrogens that are alpha to two carbonyl groups. The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism. Its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is particularly stable due to aromaticity.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound that **will** show optical isomerism. This requires the molecule to be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ (the *trans* isomer).\n    *   **Chiral Center:** The molecule has no carbon atom bonded to four different groups. It is a planar molecule that possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching these findings with the given options:\n*   A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part A: Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n1.  **Principle of Tautomerism:** The most common form of tautomerism is keto-enol tautomerism. This process requires a molecule to have a carbonyl group (C=O) and a hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (the alpha-carbon). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen.\n2.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of these double bonds. They are sp² hybridized and do not have any alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism**.\n3.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has three carbonyl groups on a saturated six-membered ring. The carbons between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are sp³ hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.

The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized and do not have the necessary α-hydrogens on a saturated carbon that can easily migrate. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are situated between carbonyl groups. These carbons are sp³ hybridized and each has two α-hydrogens.

For this to occur, a molecule generally needs a carbonyl group (the \"keto\" form) and at least one hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (an \"alpha-hydrogen\"). This alpha-hydrogen must typically be on a saturated, sp³-hybridized carbon.\n\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It has a six-membered ring with two ketone groups (C=O) and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are themselves part of the C=C double bonds. They are sp²-hybridized.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These sp²-hybridized alpha-carbons do not have the required type of alpha-hydrogens for typical keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The conversion of benzoquinone (C₆H₄O₂) to its corresponding diol, hydroquinone (C₆H₆O₂), involves a change in the molecular formula.

The carbons between the ketones (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are sp³-hybridized CH₂ groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The hydrogens on these CH₂ groups are alpha-hydrogens. They are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize. The resulting enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic compound. The high stability of this aromatic ring means the equilibrium strongly favors the enol form.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n**Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Part B (Optical Isomerism)**\n\nThe second task is to determine which compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Core Concept:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral.

In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).\n\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nThe Python script successfully solved the problem by following the plan of enumerating and pruning hypotheses.\n\n1.  **Hypothesis Generation:** The script began by creating four candidate hypotheses, one for each multiple-choice option (A, B, C, D).\n2.  **Constraint 1 (Tautomerism):** The first constraint required identifying the compound (A) that does *not* show tautomerism. The script correctly determined that benzoquinone lacks the necessary alpha-hydrogens for tautomerization, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize. This step pruned hypotheses A and B.\n3.  **Constraint 2 (Optical Isomerism):** The second constraint required identifying the compound (B) that *does* show optical isomerism. The script correctly identified that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral carbon and is therefore optically active, whereas dimethyl fumarate is not. This step pruned hypothesis D from the remaining candidates.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The only hypothesis that satisfied both constraints was C. The script correctly identified this as the final choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part A: Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound that does **not** show tautomerism. The key concept here is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen).\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** Its structure is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups (C=O) and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized and do not have any attached hydrogen atoms that can participate in tautomerization. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Its structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are sp³ hybridized and each has two α-hydrogens. The presence of these α-hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is particularly stable because it is aromatic. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound that **will** show optical isomerism. This requires the molecule to be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups in a *trans* configuration. The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part A: Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound that does **not** show tautomerism.

These carbons are sp² hybridized and do not have the type of alpha-hydrogens (on an sp³ carbon) required for typical keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion of benzoquinone to its corresponding diol (hydroquinone) is a reduction-oxidation reaction, not tautomerism, as the molecular formulas are different (C₆H₄O₂ vs. C₆H₆O₂).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons between the carbonyls are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These methylene groups contain hydrogens that are alpha to two carbonyl groups. The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism. Its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is particularly stable due to aromaticity.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound that **will** show optical isomerism.

The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of these double bonds. They are sp² hybridized and do not have any alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism**.\n3.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has three carbonyl groups on a saturated six-membered ring.

This process generally requires the presence of a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group, known as an alpha-hydrogen.\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It has a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). These carbons do not have the typical alpha-hydrogens on a saturated carbon that are required for keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone lacks the necessary alpha-hydrogens and therefore does not exhibit tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It has a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons between the carbonyls (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These CH₂ groups contain alpha-hydrogens that are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione to readily undergo tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic and highly stable compound, which strongly favors this equilibrium.\n\n**Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the Compound That Shows Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. The most common indicator of chirality is a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.

This hydrogen is known as an alpha-hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone:** The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds.

A review of the candidate answers shows that while most agents correctly identified the chemical properties, many made a clerical error in matching their correct reasoning to the final letter choice. The chemical analysis consistently points to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating careful points derived from the provided answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of Part A (Tautomerism)**\n\nThe first task is to determine which compound, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Core Concept:** The most common form of tautomerism is keto-enol tautomerism. For this to occur, a molecule generally needs a carbonyl group (the \"keto\" form) and at least one hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (an \"alpha-hydrogen\"). This alpha-hydrogen must typically be on a saturated, sp³-hybridized carbon.\n\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It has a six-membered ring with two ketone groups (C=O) and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are themselves part of the C=C double bonds. They are sp²-hybridized.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These sp²-hybridized alpha-carbons do not have the required type of alpha-hydrogens for typical keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The conversion of benzoquinone (C₆H₄O₂) to its corresponding diol, hydroquinone (C₆H₆O₂), involves a change in the molecular formula. This means it is a reduction-oxidation reaction, not an isomerization reaction like tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbons between the ketones (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are sp³-hybridized CH₂ groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The hydrogens on these CH₂ groups are alpha-hydrogens. They are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize. The resulting enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic compound. The high stability of this aromatic ring means the equilibrium strongly favors the enol form.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n**Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Part B (Optical Isomerism)**\n\nThe second task is to determine which compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Core Concept:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups in a *trans* configuration across the double bond.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The molecule is planar and possesses elements of symmetry (a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion). Any molecule with such symmetry is achiral and therefore cannot be optically active. While it is a type of stereoisomer (a geometric isomer of dimethyl maleate), it is not an optical isomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Result for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Final Conclusion**\n\nBy combining the results from both parts:\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nWe must now match this finding with the given options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\n**Careful Point:** A review of the candidate answers shows that many correctly identified the chemical properties but then failed to match them to the correct letter option. The combination \"A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\" corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
