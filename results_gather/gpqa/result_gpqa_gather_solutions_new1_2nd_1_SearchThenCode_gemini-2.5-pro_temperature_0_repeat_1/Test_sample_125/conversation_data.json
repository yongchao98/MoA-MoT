This is a chiral ketone with a single stereocenter at the C5 position, which has an (S) configuration. This stereocenter is not involved in the reaction and its configuration will be retained.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), an achiral reducing agent. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The hydride ion can attack the planar carbonyl group from either face, leading to the formation of both (R) and (S) configurations at the new C3 stereocenter. This results in two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** Since one stereocenter is the same (5S) and the other is different (3R vs. 3S), these two products are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), an achiral reducing agent. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The reaction produces three distinct stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers and their diastereomer, the meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers: the two diastereomers from Reaction I, and the three stereoisomers (enantiomeric pair + meso compound) from Reaction II.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Count:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will separate into **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different properties, and will elute as a separate, **second peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally distinct and will not co-elute.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   **Peak Count:**\n    *   The chiral column will resolve every unique stereoisomer in the mixture.\n    *   Total unique stereoisomers = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 stereoisomers**.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at the C5 position, which has an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). This reaction creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position.\n*   **Products:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces, leading to both (R) and (S) configurations at the new stereocenter. This results in two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are **diastereomers** because they have two stereocenters, one of which is the same (5S) and one of which is different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric and achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). This creates two new stereocenters at the C2 and C4 positions.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed.\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images, making them a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   In total, this reaction produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers: the two diastereomers from Reaction I and the three stereoisomers (enantiomeric pair + meso compound) from Reaction II.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity) but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as **1 peak**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different physical properties, and will elute as a separate, **second peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = 4 peaks.**\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nThis technique uses a chiral stationary phase and **can** separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   Since there are five chemically unique stereoisomers in the final mixture, a chiral column is capable of resolving all of them.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC**. This corresponds to option D. A review of the candidate answers shows that while many contain the correct chemical reasoning, several select the wrong final letter. The correct reasoning overwhelmingly points to this conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The reactant is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule has a single chiral center at the C5 position with an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. The ketone group at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol. This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Products:** The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces, leading to both (R) and (S) configurations at the new C3 center. This results in two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** Since one chiral center is the same (5S) and the other is different (3R vs. 3S), these two products are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The reactant is pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral as it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), which reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed.\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:** The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images, making them a pair of **enantiomers**. The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, this reaction produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers: the two diastereomers from Reaction I and the three stereoisomers (enantiomeric pair + meso compound) from Reaction II.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated, giving **2 peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as **1 peak**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different physical properties, and will elute as a separate, **second peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column uses a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   All five unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will give **2 peaks**.\n    *   The two enantiomers from Reaction II will be separated, giving **2 peaks**.\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction II will give **1 peak**.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC**. This corresponds to option A.\n\nA careful review of the candidate answers shows that while most perform the chemical analysis correctly to arrive at \"5 chiral peaks and 4 normal peaks,\" many incorrectly map this result to the wrong letter option. The reasoning is sound, but the final selection is flawed in many cases. The correct reasoning points directly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with one stereocenter at the C5 position, which has an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH (an achiral reagent). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position.\n*   **Products:** Since the original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected, and a new stereocenter is created at C3, two products are formed. These products have the same configuration at C5 but different configurations (R and S) at C3.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess NaBH₄ (an achiral reagent).

It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair will elute together as a single peak because they have identical properties in an achiral environment. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, will have different properties and will elute separately. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The column will separate all five unique stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated -> **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II (the two enantiomers and the meso compound) will all be separated from each other -> **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC**.

Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with one existing stereocenter at carbon C5.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced by LAH to a secondary alcohol. This creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the original stereocenter at C5 is unchanged, the reaction produces two products where the new center at C3 is either (R) or (S).\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are **diastereomers** because they have multiple stereocenters and are not mirror images of each other. Reaction I produces **2 distinct compounds**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced by NaBH₄ to form pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed.\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) products are non-superimposable mirror images, making them a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) product has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   Reaction II produces **3 distinct stereoisomers**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\nA normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n*   It **can** separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers (they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute as a single peak).\n\nLet's count the expected peaks:\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The products are an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The enantiomeric pair will elute together as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the pair and will elute separately, giving a **second peak**. This gives a total of **2 peaks** for the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally very different and will not co-elute. Therefore, the total number of peaks is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**4. Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\nA chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n*   It can separate all unique stereoisomers.\n\nLet's count the expected peaks:\n*   The total number of unique stereoisomers in the combined mixture is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 compounds**.\n*   A chiral column is capable of resolving all five of these distinct stereoisomers.\n*   **Total Peaks:** **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 Peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at the C5 position, which has an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH (a strong, achiral reducing agent). This reaction creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position.\n*   **Products:** The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction. The reduction at C3 can produce either an (R) or (S) configuration. This results in two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have one stereocenter that is the same (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S). By definition, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces a mixture of two diastereomers.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric and achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess NaBH₄ (an achiral reducing agent). This creates two new stereocenters at the C2 and C4 positions.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed. The product is pentane-2,4-diol. The possible stereoisomers are:\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images, making them a pair of **enantiomers**. They are formed in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   Reaction II produces a mixture of three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral column and separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Count:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different properties, and will elute as a separate, **second peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different and will not co-elute.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   **Peak Count:**\n    *   The final mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers (two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II).\n    *   A chiral column is capable of resolving all five of these distinct molecules.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC**.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The reactant is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule because it has a single stereocenter at the C5 position with a defined (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), an achiral reducing agent. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 can occur from either face, leading to both (R) and (S) configurations at the new C3 center. This results in two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are **diastereomers**. They are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other (one center is the same, one is different).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The reactant is pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is symmetric and achiral.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), which reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed.\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:** The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images, making them a pair of **enantiomers**. The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, which makes it an achiral **meso compound**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different physical properties, and will elute as a separate, **second peak**. This gives a total of **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (different molecular formulas, C₇H₁₆O₂ vs C₅H₁₂O₂) and will not co-elute. Therefore, the total number of peaks is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column uses a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** The column is capable of resolving every unique stereoisomer in the mixture. The total number of unique stereoisomers is the sum of the products from both reactions.\n*   Total unique stereoisomers = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 stereoisomers**.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC**. This result corresponds directly to option A.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that nearly all of them performed the chemical analysis correctly to arrive at this conclusion. However, many made a simple error in the final step by matching their correct reasoning to the wrong letter option. The chemical logic is sound and overwhelmingly points to one answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"

This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different physical properties, and will elute as a separate, **second peak**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I are structurally different from those of Reaction II and will not co-elute. Therefore, the total number of peaks is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n\n*   All five unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks.\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will give **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II (the two enantiomers and the meso compound) will be separated, giving **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The total number of peaks is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with one stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to an alcohol by LAH. This creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The reduction of the planar ketone at C3 can occur from two different faces, creating both (R) and (S) configurations at the new stereocenter.\n*   **Products:** The reaction yields two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two molecules are **diastereomers** because they have multiple stereocenters and are not mirror images of each other.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups (at C2 and C4) are reduced to alcohols by NaBH₄. This creates two new stereocenters.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This is a pair of **enantiomers**. They are formed in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed (the R,R enantiomer; the S,S enantiomer; and the meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral column and separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Counting the Peaks:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different properties, and will elute as a separate, **second peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally different and will be separated from each other.\n*   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Counting the Peaks:**\n    *   The chiral column will separate every unique stereoisomer in the mixture.\n    *   There are 2 unique stereoisomers from Reaction I. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   There are 3 unique stereoisomers from Reaction II. This gives **3 peaks** (one for each enantiomer and one for the meso compound).\n*   **Total Chiral HPLC Peaks:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.

This reaction creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The reduction of the planar ketone at C3 can occur from two different faces, leading to both (R) and (S) configurations at the new stereocenter.\n*   **Products:** Two products are formed:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two molecules have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are not mirror images of each other.

This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and has different physical properties, so it will be separated as a distinct peak. This gives **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different and will not co-elute. The total number of peaks is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n\n*   **Total Peaks:** Since there are five unique stereoisomers in the mixture, and a chiral column can resolve all of them, we expect to see **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.

This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at the C5 position, which has an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH (an achiral reagent). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position.\n*   **Products:** The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in the formation of two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are **diastereomers** because they have two stereocenters, one of which is the same (5S) and one of which is different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess NaBH₄ (an achiral reagent). This creates two new stereocenters at the C2 and C4 positions.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed. We must analyze the stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The products consist of three distinct stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers and their diastereomer, the meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers: the two diastereomers from Reaction I and the three stereoisomers from Reaction II.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity) but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different physical properties, and will elute as a separate peak. This gives **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will be well-separated. The total number of peaks is 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will be separated, giving **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The chiral column will resolve the enantiomeric pair into two separate peaks. The meso compound is also a unique stereoisomer and will elute as its own peak. This gives **3 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The total number of peaks is the total number of unique stereoisomers in the mixture. This is 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule, with the stereocenter at carbon C5 having an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced by LAH (a strong, achiral reducing agent) to a secondary alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected, the reaction produces two products where the new center at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are **diastereomers** because they have two stereocenters, one of which is the same (5S) and one of which is different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.
