The script's systematic approach avoids this human error.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the titration problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe task involves a weak acid-strong base titration. To find the pH at the two specified points, we must follow a precise sequence of calculations.\n\n1.  **Dilution:** The initial acetic acid solution is diluted, which changes its starting concentration for the titration.\n2.  **25% Titration Point:** This point is in the buffer region, where the solution contains a significant amount of both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the appropriate tool here.\n3.  **Equivalence Point:** At this point, all the initial weak acid has been completely neutralized by the strong base. The solution now contains only the conjugate base, and its pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this base in water.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution**\n\n*   **Initial Molarity (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration (M₂) is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\n**Careful Point:** The titration begins with a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid. Failing to account for this initial dilution is a common error.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   At this point, the solution is a buffer. We use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKa + log (\\[conjugate base] / \\[acid])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% of the acid remains. Therefore, the ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**Careful Point:** The ratio in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is [conjugate base]/[acid]. A common mistake is to invert this ratio.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base.\n*   **a. Find the total volume:**\n    *   Initial moles of acid = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L.\n*   **b. Find the concentration of acetate:**\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = **0.02 M**.\n*   **c. Calculate [OH⁻] from hydrolysis:**\n    *   The reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻.\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Using the equilibrium expression Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻], we get:\n        5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02).\n        x² ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n        x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   **d. Calculate pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n**Careful Point:** At the equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration, the pH must be greater than 7. You must also use the total final volume to calculate the concentration of the conjugate base.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nThese values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers and an independent step-by-step calculation, here is the breakdown of the problem to determine the final, correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nThe problem requires two main calculations: the pH at 25% titration and the pH at the equivalence point.\n\n**1. Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, the initial concentration of the acetic acid is changed by dilution.\n\n*   **Initial Molarity (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration (M₂) is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The titration begins with 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. This new concentration must be used for all subsequent calculations.\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt this point, the solution contains a mixture of unreacted acetic acid (a weak acid) and its conjugate base, acetate, forming a buffer. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the most direct method to find the pH.\n\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** pH = pKa + log(\\[conjugate base]/\\[acid])\n*   **pKa Calculation:**\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   **Ratio Calculation:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% of the acid remains. The ratio of \\[conjugate base]/\\[acid] is therefore 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   **pH Calculation:**\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.48\n    pH ≈ 4.25\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives a pH of **4.26**.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** In a buffer region for a weak acid titration, when less than 50% of the acid is neutralized, the pH will be lower than the pKa. Our result (4.26) is indeed less than the pKa (4.73), which serves as a good check.\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate. The pH of the solution is now determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), which is a weak base.\n\n*   **Moles of Acetic Acid:**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol\n*   **Volume of NaOH to Reach Equivalence:**\n    At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of acid.\n    Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total Volume and Concentration of Acetate:**\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L\n    Concentration of Acetate \\[CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Hydrolysis Calculation:**\n    The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate:\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    Now, we find the hydroxide concentration \\[OH⁻]:\n    Kb = \\[CH₃COOH]\\[OH⁻] / \\[CH₃COO⁻] ≈ x² / 0.02\n    x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = \\[OH⁻] ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Final pH Calculation:**\n    pOH = -log(\\[OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** At the equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration, the solution is basic due to the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. The pH must be greater than 7. Our result of 8.52 is consistent with this principle.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nThese values match option D. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most performed the calculation correctly, they failed to select the corresponding option letter.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, a consistent calculation emerges despite the varied final letter choices. To ensure accuracy, I will perform a step-by-step verification of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nThe first step is the dilution of the initial acetic acid solution. This is a critical point as the concentration used for the titration is lower than the starting concentration.\n\n*   **Initial Molarity (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Final Molarity (M₂):** Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt this stage, the solution is a buffer containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the most direct method for this calculation.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% of the acid remains. Therefore, the ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   **pKa Calculation:**\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:**\n    pH = pKa + log([CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH])\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form its conjugate base, the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻). The pH is now determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base in water.\n\n*   **Initial moles of acid:**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol\n*   **Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence:**\n    Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Careful Point:** The total volume of the solution at the equivalence point is the sum of the diluted acid volume and the added NaOH volume.\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L\n*   **Concentration of Acetate ([CH₃COO⁻]):**\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Hydrolysis and Kb Calculation:** The acetate ion hydrolyzes water (CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻). We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   **[OH⁻] Calculation:** We set up an equilibrium expression: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻].\n    5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Assuming x is small, we approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    x² ≈ (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Careful Point:** The result of the hydrolysis calculation is [OH⁻], which must be converted to pOH and then to pH.\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are a pH of **4.26** at 25% titration and a pH of **8.52** at the equivalence point. These values correspond to option D. The majority of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed to select the matching option.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct pH values.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   The initial volume of the 0.05 M acetic acid solution is V₁ = 20.00 cm³.\n*   It is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, so the final volume is V₂ = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³.\n*   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, we find the new concentration (M₂) of the acetic acid solution that will be titrated.\n*   M₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n*   **Careful Point:** All subsequent calculations must use this diluted concentration of 0.025 M for the acetic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   At 25% titration, the solution is in the buffer region, containing both the weak acid (acetic acid, HA) and its conjugate base (acetate, A⁻).\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used for buffer solutions: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).\n*   First, we calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the original acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% of the acid remains.\n*   Therefore, the ratio of the concentrations [A⁻]/[HA] is equal to the ratio of their moles, which is 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   Now, we can calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Ensure the ratio in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is [conjugate base]/[acid].\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate. The pH is now determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (A⁻), which is a weak base.\n*   First, find the initial moles of acetic acid:\n    *   Moles HA = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   Next, find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point:\n    *   Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion [A⁻] at this point. The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acid (0.001 mol).\n    *   [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻. We need to find the concentration of OH⁻.\n*   Calculate the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate using Kw = Ka × Kb (where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C):\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   Set up the equilibrium expression for hydrolysis, letting x = [OH⁻]:\n    *   Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻] => 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    *   x² ≈ (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Finally, calculate pOH and then pH:\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n*   **Careful Point:** At the equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration, the pH must be greater than 7. Remember to use the total volume to find the concentration of the conjugate base.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. This pair of values matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, including careful points to consider during the calculation.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution**\n\nThis is the first and a crucial step.

At 25% titration (in the buffer region).\n2.  At the equivalence point (where the acid is fully neutralized).\n\nA majority of the provided candidate answers correctly perform the chemical calculations, arriving at the same numerical results. However, several of them fail in the final step of matching their calculated results to the correct multiple-choice option. The consensus on the calculation itself is very strong.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation and Careful Points**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   The initial solution of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   **Careful Point:** The first step is to account for this dilution. The concentration used for the titration is not the original 0.05 M.\n*   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂:\n    *   M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / (20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³)\n    *   M₂ = 1.0 / 40.00 = **0.025 M**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   At this stage, the solution is a buffer, containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the most direct method.\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, calculate pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   **Careful Point:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% of the acid remains. The ratio of [A⁻]/[HA] is therefore 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   Now, apply the equation:\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base in water.\n*   **Careful Point:** You must calculate the total volume of the solution to find the concentration of the acetate ion.\n    *   Initial moles of acid = 0.025 M × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   Now, find the concentration of acetate [A⁻]:\n    *   [A⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the weak base A⁻, which produces OH⁻. We need to calculate Kb.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   Set up the equilibrium for the hydrolysis reaction (A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻) to find [OH⁻]:\n    *   Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻] ≈ [OH⁻]² / [A⁻]\n    *   [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [A⁻]) = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   **Careful Point:** Calculate pOH first, then convert to pH. A pH greater than 7 is expected.\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **8.52**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated pH values are **4.26** at 25% titration and **8.52** at the equivalence point. These values correspond directly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nThe problem involves a titration of a weak acid (acetic acid) with a strong base (NaOH) after an initial dilution. We need to find the pH at two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point.\n\n**1. Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, the initial concentration of the acetic acid for the titration must be calculated after it is diluted with water.\n*   Initial Molarity (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V₂): 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration (M₂) is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to use this diluted concentration (0.025 M) for all subsequent titration calculations.\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt this stage, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, forming a buffer solution composed of the remaining acetic acid (HA) and its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻).\n\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used for buffer solutions: **pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])**\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid ([A⁻]/[HA]) is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Ensure the ratio in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is [conjugate base]/[acid]. A common mistake is to invert this ratio.\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base in water.\n\n*   First, determine the total volume of the solution. We need to find the volume of NaOH required to reach equivalence.\n    *   Initial moles of acid = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   Next, calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([A⁻]) at this point:\n    *   [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Now, calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻] using the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ [OH⁻]² / [A⁻]\n    *   [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [A⁻]) = √(5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Finally, calculate pOH and convert to pH:\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   The pH at the equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration is always greater than 7.\n    *   Remember to use the total volume (acid + base) to find the concentration of the conjugate base.\n    *   The hydrolysis calculation yields [OH⁻], which must be converted from pOH to pH.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe detailed calculations show:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nThese calculated values correspond to option D. While many of the candidate answers performed the calculations correctly, they failed to select the matching option.

This is the starting concentration for the titration.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration:**\n    At this point, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). The solution is a buffer containing 75% HA and 25% A⁻.\n    *   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).\n    *   First, calculate the pKa: pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733.\n    *   The ratio of the concentrations [A⁻]/[HA] is equal to the mole ratio, which is 25/75 = 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point:**\n    At the equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid has been converted to 0.001 mol of acetate (A⁻).\n    *   First, determine the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed: Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   The total volume of the solution is now 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³.\n    *   The concentration of the acetate ion [A⁻] is: 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = **0.02 M**.\n    *   The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻.\n    *   The base dissociation constant (Kb) is needed: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Using the equilibrium expression Kb = [HA][OH⁻]/[A⁻], we find [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [A⁻]) = √(5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) ≈ -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = **8.52**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Initial Dilution:** It is crucial to use the diluted concentration of acetic acid (0.025 M) for all titration calculations, not the original 0.05 M.\n*   **Buffer Ratio:** At 25% titration, the ratio for the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is [A⁻]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3, a common point of error.\n*   **Equivalence Point Volume:** The concentration of the conjugate base at the equivalence point depends on the *total* volume, which is the sum of the initial diluted acid volume and the volume of titrant added.\n*   **Equivalence Point pH:** The pH of a weak acid-strong base titration at the equivalence point is always greater than 7 due to the hydrolysis of the conjugate base.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Option:** As seen in the candidate answers, many correctly calculated the values but failed to match them to the correct lettered option. The calculated pair is (4.26; 8.52), which corresponds to option C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculations consistently yield a pH of **4.26** at 25% titration and **8.52** at the equivalence point. These values match option C. The majority of the provided answers performed the calculation correctly, but several made a simple error in matching the numerical result to the corresponding letter option.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we must calculate the concentration of the acetic acid after it is diluted with water. This new concentration is the starting point for the titration.\n\n*   **Initial Molarity (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration (M₂) is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\n**Careful Point:** All subsequent titration calculations must use this diluted concentration (0.025 M) and the corresponding initial volume (40.00 cm³).\n\n### **Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) has been neutralized by the strong base (NaOH), forming its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). The remaining 75% is unreacted acid. This mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base constitutes a buffer solution.\n\n*   The pH of a buffer is best calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKa + log (\\[conjugate base] / \\[acid])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the concentration of the conjugate base to the acid is 25/75, or 1/3.\n    **Careful Point:** In a buffer, the ratio of concentrations is equal to the ratio of moles, so we can use the percentage directly.\n*   Now, substitute the values into the equation:\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.48\n    pH ≈ 4.25\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n### **Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid has been completely converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The pH of the solution is now determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion, which is a weak base.\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion:**\n    1.  **Initial moles of acid:** 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol.\n    2.  **Volume of NaOH needed:** To neutralize 0.001 mol of acid, the volume of 0.1 M NaOH is: Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    3.  **Total volume at equivalence:** 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    4.  **Concentration of acetate:** [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**.\n    **Careful Point:** The concentration of the resulting conjugate base must be calculated using the total volume of the mixed solutions.\n*   **Calculate the pH from hydrolysis:**\n    1.  The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    2.  We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    3.  Set up an equilibrium expression to find the hydroxide concentration [OH⁻]:\n        Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ [OH⁻]² / 0.02\n    4.  Solve for [OH⁻]: [OH⁻] = √(Kb × 0.02) = √(5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    5.  Calculate pOH: pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    6.  Calculate pH: pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n    **Careful Point:** The equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration is always above 7 because the product is a weak base.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nThese values correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers, there is a strong consensus on the calculation methodology, but significant confusion in matching the calculated result to the correct final option.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nThe problem is solved in two main parts: calculating the pH at 25% titration and calculating the pH at the equivalence point.\n\n**1. pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   **Initial Dilution:** First, the acetic acid is diluted.\n    *   M₁V₁ = M₂V₂\n    *   (0.05 M)(20.00 cm³) = M₂(40.00 cm³)\n    *   M₂ = 0.025 M. The concentration of acetic acid for the titration is 0.025 M.\n*   **Buffer Region Calculation:** At 25% titration, the solution is a buffer containing 75% acetic acid (HA) and 25% acetate (A⁻). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used.\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n    *   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places gives **pH = 4.26**.\n\n**2. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   **Stoichiometry:** At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   Initial moles of acid = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [A⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.02 M.\n*   **Hydrolysis Calculation:** The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the weak base, acetate.\n    *   A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Kb = [OH⁻]² / [A⁻] => [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [A⁻])\n    *   [OH⁻] = √( (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × (0.02) ) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   pOH = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are (4.26, 8.52). Comparing this to the options:\nA) 4.57; 6.92\nB) 3.17; 6.73\nC) 4.73; 7.00\nD) 4.26; 8.52\n\nThe correct option is D. The vast majority of candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed to select the corresponding option.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Initial Dilution:** It is critical to use the diluted concentration of acetic acid (0.025 M) for all titration calculations, not the original 0.05 M.\n2.  **Buffer Ratio:** At 25% titration, the ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is 25%/75% = 1/3. A common mistake is to use a ratio of 1/4.\n3.  **Equivalence Point Volume:** The concentration of the conjugate base at the equivalence point must be calculated using the total volume of the solution, which includes the initial diluted acid and the added titrant (40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³).\n4.  **Equivalence Point pH:** The equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration is always basic (pH > 7) due to the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. The calculation must proceed via Kb, [OH⁻], and pOH.\n5.  **Final Check:** After obtaining the calculated values (4.26, 8.52), one must carefully match them to the given options. This final step was the source of error for most of the candidate answers.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the candidate answers and an independent verification of the calculations, here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution**\nThis is the first and most crucial step. The initial solution is diluted before the titration begins.\n*   Initial Molarity (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V₂): 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration (M₂) is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The titration is performed on a 0.025 M acetic acid solution, not the original 0.05 M solution. All subsequent calculations must use this diluted concentration.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\nAt this stage, the solution is a buffer containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the most direct method.\n*   **Equation:** pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% of the acid remains. Therefore, the ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   **pH Calculation:**\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The ratio in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is [base]/[acid]. A common mistake is to invert this ratio.\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\nAt the equivalence point, all the weak acid has been neutralized by the strong base, and the solution contains only the conjugate base (acetate ion, CH₃COO⁻). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base.\n*   **Moles of Acid:** Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   **Volume of NaOH needed:** At equivalence, moles of base = moles of acid.\n    Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   **Total Volume:** The total volume of the solution is the sum of the diluted acid volume and the added base volume.\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L.\n*   **Concentration of Acetate:** The concentration of the acetate ion is its moles divided by the total volume.\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = **0.02 M**.\n*   **Hydrolysis Calculation:** The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻.\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Set up the equilibrium expression: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ [OH⁻]² / 0.02.\n    *   [OH⁻] = √(Kb × 0.02) = √(5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   **Final pH Calculation:**\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** At the equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration, the pH must be greater than 7 due to the formation of the conjugate base. Forgetting to calculate the total volume to find the new concentration of the conjugate base is a frequent error.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nThese values correspond to option C.

The initial 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is mixed with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   Initial Moles of Acetic Acid (CH₃COOH):\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   Final Volume after Dilution:\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L.\n*   New Concentration of Acetic Acid:\n    *   Concentration = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = **0.025 M**.\n    This is the starting concentration for the titration calculation.\n\n**Careful Point 2: pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region)**\nAt 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized, creating a buffer solution composed of the remaining acetic acid (HA) and its newly formed conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the most direct way to calculate the pH.\n*   **Equation:** pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   **pKa Calculation:** The acid dissociation constant, Ka, is 1.85x10⁻⁵.\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733.\n*   **Ratio of [A⁻]/[HA]:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has become the conjugate base, and 75% remains as acid. The ratio of their moles (and thus their concentrations) is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   **pH Calculation:**\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n**Careful Point 3: pH at the Equivalence Point (Hydrolysis)**\nAt the equivalence point, all the weak acid has been converted into its conjugate base. The pH of the solution is now determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base (acetate ion) in water.\n*   **Volume of NaOH:** First, we determine the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize the 0.001 mol of acetic acid.\n    *   Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   **Total Volume:** The total volume of the solution is the sum of the diluted acid and the added base.\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L.\n*   **Concentration of Acetate [A⁻]:** The 0.001 mol of acetate is now in a 0.05000 L solution.\n    *   [A⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = **0.02 M**.\n*   **Hydrolysis Calculation:** The acetate ion reacts with water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   **[OH⁻] Calculation:** We set up an equilibrium expression: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻].\n    *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x).\n    *   Assuming 'x' is negligible compared to 0.02, we simplify: x² ≈ (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02.\n    *   x² ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹.\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   **Final pH Calculation:**\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **8.52**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculations yield a pH of **4.26** at 25% titration and a pH of **8.52** at the equivalence point. These values correspond to option B. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most performed the calculation correctly, several made an error when selecting the final option.

    "Based on a thorough analysis of the candidate answers and an independent, step-by-step verification of the problem, a definitive answer can be determined. While the majority of the provided answers correctly perform the underlying chemical calculations, there is widespread error in matching the final calculated values to the correct multiple-choice option as listed in the original problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nTo find the correct answer, we must perform three main calculations: account for the initial dilution, find the pH in the buffer region (25% titration), and find the pH at the equivalence point (hydrolysis).\n\n**Careful Point 1: Initial Dilution**\nThe first and most critical step is to calculate the concentration of the acetic acid *after* it has been diluted with water, as this is the solution that is actually titrated.\n*   **Initial Molarity (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration (M₂) is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n*   All subsequent calculations must start with 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**Careful Point 2: pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region)**\nAt this point, 25% of the weak acid has been converted to its conjugate base, creating a buffer. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the most direct method to find the pH.\n*   **Equation:** pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n*   **pKa Calculation:** First, calculate pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   **Ratio Calculation:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has become the conjugate base and 75% remains as acid. The ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is therefore 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   **pH Calculation:**\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n**Careful Point 3: pH at the Equivalence Point (Hydrolysis)**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, and the solution contains only its conjugate base, the acetate ion. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base.\n*   **Volume and Concentration:**\n    1.  Initial moles of acid = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol.\n    2.  Volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize the acid = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    3.  The total volume at the equivalence point is the sum of the diluted acid and the added base: 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L. This is a frequent point of error.\n    4.  The concentration of the acetate ion [CH₃COO⁻] is Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = **0.02 M**.\n*   **Hydrolysis Calculation:**\n    1.  The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻.\n    2.  We need the base dissociation constant, Kb: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    3.  Set up the equilibrium expression to find [OH⁻]: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ [OH⁻]² / 0.02.\n    4.  Solve for [OH⁻]: [OH⁻] = √(Kb × 0.02) = √(5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   **Final pH Calculation:** The hydrolysis produces OH⁻, so we must calculate pOH first.\n    1.  pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    2.  pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**.\n    3.  As expected for a weak acid-strong base titration, the pH at the equivalence point is basic (> 7).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe step-by-step calculation yields the following values:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nComparing this pair of values, (4.26; 8.52), to the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) 4.26; 8.52**\n*   B) 3.17; 6.73\n*   C) 4.57; 6.92\n*   D) 4.73; 7.00\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option A.

The script's systematic approach avoids this human error.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the titration problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe task involves a weak acid-strong base titration. To find the pH at the two specified points, we must follow a precise sequence of calculations.\n\n1.  **Dilution:** The initial acetic acid solution is diluted, which changes its starting concentration for the titration.\n2.  **25% Titration Point:** This point is in the buffer region, where the solution contains a significant amount of both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the appropriate tool here.\n3.  **Equivalence Point:** At this point, all the initial weak acid has been completely neutralized by the strong base. The solution now contains only the conjugate base, and its pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this base in water.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution**\n\n*   **Initial Molarity (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration (M₂) is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\n**Careful Point:** The titration begins with a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid. Failing to account for this initial dilution is a common error.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   At this point, the solution is a buffer. We use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKa + log (\\[conjugate base] / \\[acid])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% of the acid remains. Therefore, the ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**Careful Point:** The ratio in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is [conjugate base]/[acid]. A common mistake is to invert this ratio.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base.\n*   **a. Find the total volume:**\n    *   Initial moles of acid = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L.\n*   **b. Find the concentration of acetate:**\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = **0.02 M**.\n*   **c. Calculate [OH⁻] from hydrolysis:**\n    *   The reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻.\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Using the equilibrium expression Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻], we get:\n        5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02).\n        x² ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n        x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   **d. Calculate pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n**Careful Point:** At the equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration, the pH must be greater than 7. You must also use the total final volume to calculate the concentration of the conjugate base.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nThese values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers and an independent step-by-step calculation, here is the breakdown of the problem to determine the final, correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nThe problem requires two main calculations: the pH at 25% titration and the pH at the equivalence point.\n\n**1. Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, the initial concentration of the acetic acid is changed by dilution.\n\n*   **Initial Molarity (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration (M₂) is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The titration begins with 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. This new concentration must be used for all subsequent calculations.\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt this point, the solution contains a mixture of unreacted acetic acid (a weak acid) and its conjugate base, acetate, forming a buffer. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the most direct method to find the pH.\n\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** pH = pKa + log(\\[conjugate base]/\\[acid])\n*   **pKa Calculation:**\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   **Ratio Calculation:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% of the acid remains. The ratio of \\[conjugate base]/\\[acid] is therefore 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   **pH Calculation:**\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.48\n    pH ≈ 4.25\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives a pH of **4.26**.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** In a buffer region for a weak acid titration, when less than 50% of the acid is neutralized, the pH will be lower than the pKa. Our result (4.26) is indeed less than the pKa (4.73), which serves as a good check.\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate. The pH of the solution is now determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), which is a weak base.\n\n*   **Moles of Acetic Acid:**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol\n*   **Volume of NaOH to Reach Equivalence:**\n    At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of acid.\n    Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total Volume and Concentration of Acetate:**\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L\n    Concentration of Acetate \\[CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Hydrolysis Calculation:**\n    The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate:\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    Now, we find the hydroxide concentration \\[OH⁻]:\n    Kb = \\[CH₃COOH]\\[OH⁻] / \\[CH₃COO⁻] ≈ x² / 0.02\n    x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = \\[OH⁻] ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Final pH Calculation:**\n    pOH = -log(\\[OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** At the equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration, the solution is basic due to the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. The pH must be greater than 7. Our result of 8.52 is consistent with this principle.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nThese values match option D. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most performed the calculation correctly, they failed to select the corresponding option letter.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, a consistent calculation emerges despite the varied final letter choices. To ensure accuracy, I will perform a step-by-step verification of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nThe first step is the dilution of the initial acetic acid solution. This is a critical point as the concentration used for the titration is lower than the starting concentration.\n\n*   **Initial Molarity (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Final Molarity (M₂):** Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt this stage, the solution is a buffer containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the most direct method for this calculation.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% of the acid remains.

The solution is a buffer containing 75% HA and 25% A⁻.\n    *   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).\n    *   First, calculate the pKa: pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733.\n    *   The ratio of the concentrations [A⁻]/[HA] is equal to the mole ratio, which is 25/75 = 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point:**\n    At the equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid has been converted to 0.001 mol of acetate (A⁻).\n    *   First, determine the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed: Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   The total volume of the solution is now 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³.\n    *   The concentration of the acetate ion [A⁻] is: 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = **0.02 M**.\n    *   The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻.\n    *   The base dissociation constant (Kb) is needed: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Using the equilibrium expression Kb = [HA][OH⁻]/[A⁻], we find [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [A⁻]) = √(5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) ≈ -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = **8.52**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Initial Dilution:** It is crucial to use the diluted concentration of acetic acid (0.025 M) for all titration calculations, not the original 0.05 M.\n*   **Buffer Ratio:** At 25% titration, the ratio for the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is [A⁻]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3, a common point of error.\n*   **Equivalence Point Volume:** The concentration of the conjugate base at the equivalence point depends on the *total* volume, which is the sum of the initial diluted acid volume and the volume of titrant added.\n*   **Equivalence Point pH:** The pH of a weak acid-strong base titration at the equivalence point is always greater than 7 due to the hydrolysis of the conjugate base.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Option:** As seen in the candidate answers, many correctly calculated the values but failed to match them to the correct lettered option. The calculated pair is (4.26; 8.52), which corresponds to option C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculations consistently yield a pH of **4.26** at 25% titration and **8.52** at the equivalence point. These values match option C. The majority of the provided answers performed the calculation correctly, but several made a simple error in matching the numerical result to the corresponding letter option.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we must calculate the concentration of the acetic acid after it is diluted with water. This new concentration is the starting point for the titration.\n\n*   **Initial Molarity (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration (M₂) is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\n**Careful Point:** All subsequent titration calculations must use this diluted concentration (0.025 M) and the corresponding initial volume (40.00 cm³).\n\n### **Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) has been neutralized by the strong base (NaOH), forming its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). The remaining 75% is unreacted acid. This mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base constitutes a buffer solution.\n\n*   The pH of a buffer is best calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKa + log (\\[conjugate base] / \\[acid])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the concentration of the conjugate base to the acid is 25/75, or 1/3.\n    **Careful Point:** In a buffer, the ratio of concentrations is equal to the ratio of moles, so we can use the percentage directly.\n*   Now, substitute the values into the equation:\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.48\n    pH ≈ 4.25\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n### **Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid has been completely converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The pH of the solution is now determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion, which is a weak base.\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion:**\n    1.  **Initial moles of acid:** 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol.\n    2.  **Volume of NaOH needed:** To neutralize 0.001 mol of acid, the volume of 0.1 M NaOH is: Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    3.  **Total volume at equivalence:** 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    4.  **Concentration of acetate:** [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**.\n    **Careful Point:** The concentration of the resulting conjugate base must be calculated using the total volume of the mixed solutions.\n*   **Calculate the pH from hydrolysis:**\n    1.  The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    2.  We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    3.  Set up an equilibrium expression to find the hydroxide concentration [OH⁻]:\n        Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ [OH⁻]² / 0.02\n    4.  Solve for [OH⁻]: [OH⁻] = √(Kb × 0.02) = √(5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    5.  Calculate pOH: pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    6.  Calculate pH: pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n    **Careful Point:** The equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration is always above 7 because the product is a weak base.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nThese values correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers, there is a strong consensus on the calculation methodology, but significant confusion in matching the calculated result to the correct final option.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nThe problem is solved in two main parts: calculating the pH at 25% titration and calculating the pH at the equivalence point.\n\n**1. pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   **Initial Dilution:** First, the acetic acid is diluted.\n    *   M₁V₁ = M₂V₂\n    *   (0.05 M)(20.00 cm³) = M₂(40.00 cm³)\n    *   M₂ = 0.025 M. The concentration of acetic acid for the titration is 0.025 M.\n*   **Buffer Region Calculation:** At 25% titration, the solution is a buffer containing 75% acetic acid (HA) and 25% acetate (A⁻). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used.\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n    *   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places gives **pH = 4.26**.\n\n**2. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   **Stoichiometry:** At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   Initial moles of acid = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [A⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.02 M.\n*   **Hydrolysis Calculation:** The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the weak base, acetate.\n    *   A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Kb = [OH⁻]² / [A⁻] => [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [A⁻])\n    *   [OH⁻] = √( (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × (0.02) ) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   pOH = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are (4.26, 8.52). Comparing this to the options:\nA) 4.57; 6.92\nB) 3.17; 6.73\nC) 4.73; 7.00\nD) 4.26; 8.52\n\nThe correct option is D. The vast majority of candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed to select the corresponding option.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Initial Dilution:** It is critical to use the diluted concentration of acetic acid (0.025 M) for all titration calculations, not the original 0.05 M.\n2.  **Buffer Ratio:** At 25% titration, the ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is 25%/75% = 1/3. A common mistake is to use a ratio of 1/4.\n3.  **Equivalence Point Volume:** The concentration of the conjugate base at the equivalence point must be calculated using the total volume of the solution, which includes the initial diluted acid and the added titrant (40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³).\n4.  **Equivalence Point pH:** The equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration is always basic (pH > 7) due to the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. The calculation must proceed via Kb, [OH⁻], and pOH.\n5.  **Final Check:** After obtaining the calculated values (4.26, 8.52), one must carefully match them to the given options. This final step was the source of error for most of the candidate answers.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the candidate answers and an independent verification of the calculations, here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution**\nThis is the first and most crucial step. The initial solution is diluted before the titration begins.\n*   Initial Molarity (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V₂): 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration (M₂) is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The titration is performed on a 0.025 M acetic acid solution, not the original 0.05 M solution. All subsequent calculations must use this diluted concentration.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\nAt this stage, the solution is a buffer containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the most direct method.\n*   **Equation:** pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% of the acid remains. Therefore, the ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   **pH Calculation:**\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The ratio in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is [base]/[acid]. A common mistake is to invert this ratio.\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\nAt the equivalence point, all the weak acid has been neutralized by the strong base, and the solution contains only the conjugate base (acetate ion, CH₃COO⁻). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base.\n*   **Moles of Acid:** Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   **Volume of NaOH needed:** At equivalence, moles of base = moles of acid.\n    Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   **Total Volume:** The total volume of the solution is the sum of the diluted acid volume and the added base volume.\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L.\n*   **Concentration of Acetate:** The concentration of the acetate ion is its moles divided by the total volume.\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = **0.02 M**.\n*   **Hydrolysis Calculation:** The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻.\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Set up the equilibrium expression: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ [OH⁻]² / 0.02.\n    *   [OH⁻] = √(Kb × 0.02) = √(5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   **Final pH Calculation:**\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** At the equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration, the pH must be greater than 7 due to the formation of the conjugate base. Forgetting to calculate the total volume to find the new concentration of the conjugate base is a frequent error.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nThese values correspond to option C. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most agents performed the calculation correctly, several made a mistake in matching the calculated values to the correct lettered option.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Titration Problem**\n\nThe task requires calculating the pH at two distinct points during the titration of a weak acid (acetic acid) with a strong base (NaOH) after an initial dilution.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Initial Dilution**\nThe first step is to account for the dilution of the acetic acid. The initial 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is mixed with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   Initial Moles of Acetic Acid (CH₃COOH):\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   Final Volume after Dilution:\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L.\n*   New Concentration of Acetic Acid:\n    *   Concentration = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = **0.025 M**.\n    This is the starting concentration for the titration calculation.\n\n**Careful Point 2: pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region)**\nAt 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized, creating a buffer solution composed of the remaining acetic acid (HA) and its newly formed conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the most direct way to calculate the pH.\n*   **Equation:** pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   **pKa Calculation:** The acid dissociation constant, Ka, is 1.85x10⁻⁵.\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733.\n*   **Ratio of [A⁻]/[HA]:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has become the conjugate base, and 75% remains as acid. The ratio of their moles (and thus their concentrations) is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   **pH Calculation:**\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n**Careful Point 3: pH at the Equivalence Point (Hydrolysis)**\nAt the equivalence point, all the weak acid has been converted into its conjugate base. The pH of the solution is now determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base (acetate ion) in water.\n*   **Volume of NaOH:** First, we determine the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize the 0.001 mol of acetic acid.\n    *   Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   **Total Volume:** The total volume of the solution is the sum of the diluted acid and the added base.\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L.\n*   **Concentration of Acetate [A⁻]:** The 0.001 mol of acetate is now in a 0.05000 L solution.\n    *   [A⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = **0.02 M**.\n*   **Hydrolysis Calculation:** The acetate ion reacts with water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   **[OH⁻] Calculation:** We set up an equilibrium expression: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻].\n    *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x).\n    *   Assuming 'x' is negligible compared to 0.02, we simplify: x² ≈ (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02.\n    *   x² ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹.\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   **Final pH Calculation:**\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **8.52**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculations yield a pH of **4.26** at 25% titration and a pH of **8.52** at the equivalence point. These values correspond to option B. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most performed the calculation correctly, several made an error when selecting the final option. The consensus of the correctly reasoned answers points to B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
