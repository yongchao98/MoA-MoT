Analysis of the Physical Principles**\nAll candidate answers correctly identify that this problem is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum, applied within the framework of special relativity.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion is stationary (momentum = 0), the two product particles (muon and neutrino) must be emitted in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes. Let's call this momentum `p`.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy (the rest energy of the pion, $m_{\\pi}c^2$) must equal the sum of the total energies of the final particles ($E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$).\n\n**2. Analysis of the Calculation Method**\nThere is a strong consensus among all candidate answers on the method to solve the problem. The standard derivation is as follows:\n1.  Start with the energy conservation equation: $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$.\n2.  Use the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. For the massless neutrino, this simplifies to $E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n3.  Substitute the energy expressions: $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$.\n4.  Rearrange and square the equation to solve for the momentum term `pc`. This leads to the formula:\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\nThis derivation is correct and used consistently across all provided answers.\n\n**3. Verification of the Numerical Calculation**\nAll candidate answers perform the same calculation using the given values:\n*   Rest energy of Pi(+) ($m_{\\pi}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest energy of mu(+) ($m_{\\mu}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\n*   $pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78$ MeV\n\nThis value, `pc`, is the kinetic energy of the massless neutrino.\n*   $KE_{\\nu} \\approx 29.8$ MeV\n\nThe total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest energies:\n*   $KE_{total} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2 = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9$ MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is the remainder:\n*   $KE_{\\mu} = KE_{total} - KE_{\\nu} = 33.9 - 29.78 \\approx 4.12$ MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are **4.12 MeV** for the muon and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino. This numerical result is unanimously agreed upon by all candidate answers.\n\n**4. Final Decision**\nThe only discrepancy among the candidate answers is the final letter they select. This is due to the options being presented in a different, shuffled order for each agent. I will make the final decision based on the original question's option list:\n\n*   A) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n*   B) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n*   C) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n*   D) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe unanimously calculated values (4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV) perfectly match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis using the principles of special relativity to determine the kinetic energies of the particles produced in a decay.\n\n**1. Statement of Principles**\nThe decay of a stationary particle into two product particles is governed by two fundamental conservation laws:\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system is zero before and after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy (including rest mass energy) is the same before and after the decay.\n\n**2. Initial and Final States**\n*   **Initial State:** A stationary positive pion (π⁺).\n    *   Initial Momentum: p_initial = 0\n    *   Initial Energy: E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n*   **Final State:** A positive muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν).\n    *   Rest Energy of Muon: m_μc² = 105.7 MeV\n    *   Rest Energy of Neutrino: m_νc² = 0 (assumed massless)\n\n**3. Applying Conservation Laws**\n*   From **momentum conservation**, since the initial momentum is zero, the two product particles must fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this momentum `p`.\n*   From **energy conservation**, the initial energy equals the sum of the total final energies:\n    m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**4. Relativistic Calculation**\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n*   For the muon: E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n*   For the massless neutrino: E_ν = pc\n\nSubstituting these into the energy conservation equation:\nm_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc\n\nTo solve for `pc`, we rearrange and square the equation:\n1.  m_πc² - pc = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n2.  (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n3.  (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n4.  The (pc)² terms cancel. Solving for `pc` gives:\n    pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]\n\n**5. Numerical Calculation**\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   pc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n*   pc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n*   pc = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\n**6. Determining the Kinetic Energies (KE)**\n*   **KE of the Neutrino (KE_ν):** For a massless particle, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n    KE_ν = pc ≈ **29.8 MeV**\n*   **KE of the Muon (KE_μ):** The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest energies: KE_total = m_πc² - m_μc² = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV. This is shared between the products.\n    KE_μ = KE_total - KE_ν\n    KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV ≈ **4.12 MeV**\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Relativistic Treatment:** The energy released is a significant fraction of the rest masses, so classical mechanics (KE = ½mv²) is not applicable. Relativistic formulas for energy and momentum are essential.\n*   **Massless Neutrino:** The assumption that the neutrino is massless simplifies the calculation, making its total energy equal to `pc`.\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** All candidate answers, despite some confusion with the final letter choice, correctly performed the same physical calculation and arrived at the same numerical results (4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV).\n*   **Option Matching:** The primary source of disagreement among the candidate answers was matching the calculated values to the correct letter (A, B, C, or D), likely due to the options being presented in a different order to each agent. The crucial step is to compare the final calculated numbers to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (μ⁺) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (ν). Comparing these values to the provided options:\n*   A) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n*   B) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n*   C) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n*   D) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated results match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this physics problem by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum, using the equations of special relativity. The candidate answers all follow a similar correct physical derivation, but some seem to have made errors in matching their calculated result to the correct multiple-choice letter. I will perform the calculation from first principles to ensure accuracy.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **State the physical principles:** The decay is governed by the conservation of energy and momentum.\n2.  **Set up the equations:**\n    *   From momentum conservation, since the initial pion is at rest, the two product particles (muon and neutrino) must have equal and opposite momenta, `p`.\n    *   From energy conservation, the initial rest energy of the pion equals the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n3.  **Use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:** $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. For the massless neutrino, this simplifies to $E_{\\nu} = pc$, which is also its kinetic energy.\n4.  **Solve for the momentum term `pc`:** Combine the conservation equations to derive a formula for `pc`. This value will be the kinetic energy of the neutrino.\n5.  **Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon:** The total kinetic energy released (the Q-value) is the difference in rest energies. The muon's kinetic energy is this total energy minus the neutrino's kinetic energy.\n6.  **Implement in Python:** Use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately and select the correct option from the provided list.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given rest mass energies in MeV.\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # Rest energy of the positive pion (Pi+)\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # Rest energy of the positive muon (mu+)\n# The neutrino is assumed to be massless.\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the momentum term (pc) of the products.\n# From conservation of energy and momentum, we can derive the formula:\n# pc = ( (m_pi_c2)^2 - (m_mu_c2)^2 ) / ( 2 * m_pi_c2 )\n# This value is also the kinetic energy of the massless neutrino.\nke_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu).\n# The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest energies.\n# Q = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n# This total KE is shared between the two products: Q = KE_mu + KE_nu\n# Therefore, KE_mu = Q - KE_nu\nq_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\nke_mu = q_value - ke_nu\n\n# Step 4: Print the results and compare with the options.\n# The problem asks for the KE of the product particles.

Understand the Core Physics**\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary particle (a pion) into two other particles (a muon and a neutrino). This is a classic problem in relativistic kinematics, governed by two fundamental principles:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n**2.

Step-by-Step Derivation (Consensus from all agents)**\nAll provided answers follow the same correct logical steps to solve the problem.\n\n*   **Step A: Apply Momentum Conservation.**\n    Since the initial momentum is zero, the two product particles must fly off in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes. Let's call this momentum `p`.\n    $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n*   **Step B: Apply Energy Conservation.**\n    The initial energy ($m_{\\pi}c^2$) must equal the sum of the total final energies ($E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$).\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n\n*   **Step C: Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation.**\n    The relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the massless neutrino: $E_{\\nu} = pc$. (Its total energy is purely kinetic).\n\n*   **Step D: Solve for the Momentum (`pc`).**\n    By substituting the expressions from Step C into the equation from Step B and rearranging, all agents correctly derive the formula for the momentum of the products:\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n**4.

Define the System and Principles**\n\n*   **Decay Process:** A stationary positive pion ($\\pi^+$) decays into a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu$). The reaction is: $\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$.\n*   **Initial State:** The pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero ($p_{initial} = 0$) and its initial energy is its rest energy ($E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$).\n*   **Given Information:**\n    *   Rest energy of $\\pi^+$ ($m_{\\pi}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV\n    *   Rest energy of $\\mu^+$ ($m_{\\mu}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV\n    *   The neutrino ($\\nu$) is assumed to be massless ($m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$).\n*   **Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Momentum Conservation:** The total momentum after the decay must also be zero. This means the muon and neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes. Let this momentum be `p`.\n    *   **Energy Conservation:** The total energy before must equal the total energy after. We must use relativistic energy formulas.\n\n**2. Set up the Equations**\n\n*   From momentum conservation: $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$.\n*   From energy conservation: $E_{initial} = E_{final} \\implies m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$.\n*   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$.\n    *   For the massless neutrino: $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0^2} = pc$.\n\n**3.

Isolate the square root: $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n3.  Square both sides: $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n4.  Expand and simplify: $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n5.

Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n*   For the muon: E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n*   For the massless neutrino: E_ν = pc. Its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy.\n\n**4. Derivation and Calculation**\nBy conserving energy, we set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\nm_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\nm_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc\n\nTo solve for the momentum `pc`, we rearrange and square the equation:\nm_πc² - pc = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nThe (pc)² terms cancel out. Solving for `pc` gives:\npc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n*   m_μc² = 105.7 MeV\n\npc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\npc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\npc = 8315.67 / 279.2\npc ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\n**5.

Therefore, the total momentum of the product particles (muon μ⁺ and neutrino ν) must also be zero. This implies they are emitted in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes, which we'll call `p`.\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay (the rest energy of the pion) must equal the sum of the total energies of the product particles after the decay.\n\n2.  **Set up the Equations:**\n    *   Given rest energies:\n        *   Pion (m_πc²): 139.6 MeV\n        *   Muon (m_μc²): 105.7 MeV\n    *   The neutrino (ν) is assumed to be massless (m_νc² = 0).\n    *   From momentum conservation: p_μ = p_ν = p\n    *   From energy conservation: m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n3.  **Use Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    The total energy `E` of a particle is related to its momentum `p` and rest mass `m` by the formula E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    *   For the muon: E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n    *   For the massless neutrino: E_ν = √((pc)² + 0) = pc. The kinetic energy of a massless particle is its total energy, so KE_ν = pc.\n\n4.  **Derive the Solution:**\n    By combining the conservation equations, we can solve for the momentum `pc`.\n    *   Start with energy conservation: m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n    *   Substitute the expressions for energy: m_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc\n    *   Isolate the square root and square both sides: (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   Expand and simplify: (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   This simplifies to a formula for `pc`:\n        pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Calculate `pc`, which is the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_ν):\n        pc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n        pc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n        pc = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV\n        So, **KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**.\n\n    *   Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ):\n        The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest energies:\n        KE_total = m_πc² - m_μc² = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV.\n        This energy is shared between the two products: KE_total = KE_μ + KE_ν.\n        KE_μ = KE_total - KE_ν\n        KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV\n        So, **KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated kinetic energies for the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (μ⁺) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (ν).\n\n    Comparing this result to the provided options:\n    A) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n    B) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n    C) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n    D) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n\n    The calculated values match option B.

Deconstruction of the Physics Problem**\n\nThe core of the problem is a two-body decay of a stationary particle. The governing principles are the conservation of energy and conservation of momentum, applied within the framework of special relativity.\n\n*   **Initial State:** A stationary positive pion (π⁺).\n    *   Initial Energy (E_initial) = Rest energy of the pion = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV.\n    *   Initial Momentum (p_initial) = 0.\n*   **Final State:** A positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν).\n    *   Rest energy of muon = m_μc² = 105.7 MeV.\n    *   Rest energy of neutrino is assumed to be 0 (m_νc² = 0).\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since p_initial = 0, the final momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let the magnitude of the momentum of each product particle be 'p'.\n    *   |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy must equal the sum of the total final energies.\n    *   E_initial = E_μ + E_ν\n    *   m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**2. Synthesis of the Calculation Method**\n\nAll the provided candidate answers correctly identify the same method to solve the problem. The key steps are:\n1.  Use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n2.  For the massless neutrino, its total energy is E_ν = pc, which is also its kinetic energy (KE_ν).\n3.  For the muon, its total energy is E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²).\n4.  Substitute these into the energy conservation equation: m_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc.\n5.  Algebraically solve this equation for the term 'pc'. The standard derived formula is:\n    pc = [ (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2 * m_πc² ]\n6.  Calculate the numerical value of 'pc'. This gives the kinetic energy of the neutrino.\n7.  Calculate the total kinetic energy released (the Q-value): KE_total = m_πc² - m_μc².\n8.  Calculate the muon's kinetic energy: KE_μ = KE_total - KE_ν.\n\n**3.

Since the speeds of the resulting particles are a significant fraction of the speed of light, relativistic equations must be used.\n\n2.  **Initial State**:\n    *   The initial particle is a positive pion (π⁺).\n    *   It is stationary, meaning its initial momentum is zero.\n    *   Its total initial energy is its rest mass energy, E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV.\n\n3.  **Final State**:\n    *   The final particles are a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν).\n    *   The rest mass energy of the muon is m_μc² = 105.7 MeV.\n    *   The neutrino is assumed to be massless, so its rest mass energy is m_νc² = 0.\n\n4.  **Conservation of Momentum**:\n    *   Since the initial momentum is zero, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n    *   This implies the muon and neutrino must travel in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this momentum `p`.\n    *   |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n5.  **Conservation of Energy**:\n    *   The initial energy equals the sum of the total final energies: E_initial = E_μ + E_ν.\n    *   We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n        *   For the muon: E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n        *   For the massless neutrino: E_ν = pc. For a massless particle, its total energy is purely kinetic, so KE_ν = pc.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\nThe unanimous approach across all valid analyses is to first solve for the momentum `p` (or more conveniently, the term `pc`).\n\n1.  **Set up the energy conservation equation**:\n    m_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc\n\n2.  **Solve for `pc`**: To solve for `pc`, we isolate the square root and square both sides.\n    m_πc² - pc = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n    (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\n3.  **Simplify**: The (pc)² terms cancel out. We can now solve for `pc`.\n    (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)(pc)\n    pc = [ (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2(m_πc²) ]\n\n4.  **Numerical Calculation**:\n    *   pc = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\n    *   pc = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / 279.2\n    *   pc = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\n5.  **Determine Kinetic Energies**:\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν)**: As established, KE_ν = pc.\n        KE_ν ≈ **29.8 MeV**\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ)**: The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest energies, which is shared between the products: KE_total = KE_μ + KE_ν.\n        KE_total = m_πc² - m_μc² = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n        KE_μ = KE_total - KE_ν\n        KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV ≈ **4.12 MeV**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies for the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (μ⁺) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (ν).

The solution requires applying the fundamental principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum, using the framework of special relativity since the particles' energies are comparable to their rest masses.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial pion (π⁺) is stationary, meaning its initial momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles—the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν)—must be emitted in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's denote this momentum magnitude by `p`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   **Initial Energy:** The energy of the stationary pion is purely its rest mass energy:\n        E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n    *   **Final Energy:** The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\n        E_final = E_μ + E_ν\n    *   Therefore: m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    *   For the massive muon: E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n    *   For the massless neutrino: The rest mass is zero, so its total energy is E_ν = pc. A crucial point is that for a massless particle, its total energy is entirely kinetic energy. Thus, KE_ν = E_ν = pc.\n\n4.  **Solving for the Unknowns:** The most direct method, as correctly identified by all candidate answers, is to solve for the momentum term `pc`.\n    *   Start with the energy conservation equation: m_πc² = E_μ + pc\n    *   Isolate the muon's energy: E_μ = m_πc² - pc\n    *   Substitute this into the muon's energy-momentum relation: (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   Expand the left side: (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   The (pc)² terms cancel out. Rearranging to solve for `pc` gives the standard formula for a two-body decay:\n        pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   Substitute the given values:\n        pc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n        pc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n        pc = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):** As established, KE_ν = pc.\n        KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):** The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in the initial and final rest masses, which is shared between the products.\n        KE_total = m_πc² - m_μc² = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n        This total kinetic energy is the sum of the products' kinetic energies: KE_total = KE_μ + KE_ν.\n        KE_μ = KE_total - KE_ν = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies for the product particles are approximately **4.12 MeV** for the muon (μ⁺) and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino (ν).

Let's call this momentum `p`.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy (the rest energy of the pion, $m_{\\pi}c^2$) must equal the sum of the total energies of the final particles ($E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$).\n\n**2. Analysis of the Calculation Method**\nThere is a strong consensus among all candidate answers on the method to solve the problem. The standard derivation is as follows:\n1.  Start with the energy conservation equation: $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$.\n2.  Use the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. For the massless neutrino, this simplifies to $E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n3.  Substitute the energy expressions: $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$.\n4.  Rearrange and square the equation to solve for the momentum term `pc`. This leads to the formula:\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\nThis derivation is correct and used consistently across all provided answers.\n\n**3. Verification of the Numerical Calculation**\nAll candidate answers perform the same calculation using the given values:\n*   Rest energy of Pi(+) ($m_{\\pi}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest energy of mu(+) ($m_{\\mu}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\n*   $pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78$ MeV\n\nThis value, `pc`, is the kinetic energy of the massless neutrino.\n*   $KE_{\\nu} \\approx 29.8$ MeV\n\nThe total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest energies:\n*   $KE_{total} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2 = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9$ MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is the remainder:\n*   $KE_{\\mu} = KE_{total} - KE_{\\nu} = 33.9 - 29.78 \\approx 4.12$ MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are **4.12 MeV** for the muon and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino.

Statement of Principles**\nThe decay of a stationary particle into two product particles is governed by two fundamental conservation laws:\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system is zero before and after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy (including rest mass energy) is the same before and after the decay.\n\n**2. Initial and Final States**\n*   **Initial State:** A stationary positive pion (π⁺).\n    *   Initial Momentum: p_initial = 0\n    *   Initial Energy: E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n*   **Final State:** A positive muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν).\n    *   Rest Energy of Muon: m_μc² = 105.7 MeV\n    *   Rest Energy of Neutrino: m_νc² = 0 (assumed massless)\n\n**3. Applying Conservation Laws**\n*   From **momentum conservation**, since the initial momentum is zero, the two product particles must fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this momentum `p`.\n*   From **energy conservation**, the initial energy equals the sum of the total final energies:\n    m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**4. Relativistic Calculation**\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n*   For the muon: E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n*   For the massless neutrino: E_ν = pc\n\nSubstituting these into the energy conservation equation:\nm_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc\n\nTo solve for `pc`, we rearrange and square the equation:\n1.  m_πc² - pc = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n2.  (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n3.  (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n4.  The (pc)² terms cancel. Solving for `pc` gives:\n    pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]\n\n**5. Numerical Calculation**\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   pc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n*   pc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n*   pc = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\n**6. Determining the Kinetic Energies (KE)**\n*   **KE of the Neutrino (KE_ν):** For a massless particle, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n    KE_ν = pc ≈ **29.8 MeV**\n*   **KE of the Muon (KE_μ):** The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest energies: KE_total = m_πc² - m_μc² = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV. This is shared between the products.\n    KE_μ = KE_total - KE_ν\n    KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV ≈ **4.12 MeV**\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Relativistic Treatment:** The energy released is a significant fraction of the rest masses, so classical mechanics (KE = ½mv²) is not applicable. Relativistic formulas for energy and momentum are essential.\n*   **Massless Neutrino:** The assumption that the neutrino is massless simplifies the calculation, making its total energy equal to `pc`.\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** All candidate answers, despite some confusion with the final letter choice, correctly performed the same physical calculation and arrived at the same numerical results (4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV).\n*   **Option Matching:** The primary source of disagreement among the candidate answers was matching the calculated values to the correct letter (A, B, C, or D), likely due to the options being presented in a different order to each agent. The crucial step is to compare the final calculated numbers to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (μ⁺) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (ν).

The candidate answers all follow a similar correct physical derivation, but some seem to have made errors in matching their calculated result to the correct multiple-choice letter. I will perform the calculation from first principles to ensure accuracy.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **State the physical principles:** The decay is governed by the conservation of energy and momentum.\n2.  **Set up the equations:**\n    *   From momentum conservation, since the initial pion is at rest, the two product particles (muon and neutrino) must have equal and opposite momenta, `p`.\n    *   From energy conservation, the initial rest energy of the pion equals the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n3.  **Use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:** $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. For the massless neutrino, this simplifies to $E_{\\nu} = pc$, which is also its kinetic energy.\n4.  **Solve for the momentum term `pc`:** Combine the conservation equations to derive a formula for `pc`. This value will be the kinetic energy of the neutrino.\n5.  **Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon:** The total kinetic energy released (the Q-value) is the difference in rest energies.

Isolate the square root: $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n3.  Square both sides: $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n4.

Understand the Physics Principles**\n\n*   **Decay Process**: A stationary positive pion ($\\pi^+$) decays into a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu$). The reaction is: $\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the initial pion is stationary, its momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles must be emitted in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes. Let's call this momentum `p`.\n*   **Conservation of Energy**: The initial energy (the rest energy of the pion) must equal the sum of the total energies of the two product particles after the decay.\n\n**2. Set up the Relativistic Equations**\n\n*   **Given Information**:\n    *   Rest energy of $\\pi^+$ ($m_{\\pi}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV.\n    *   Rest energy of $\\mu^+$ ($m_{\\mu}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV.\n    *   The neutrino ($\\nu$) is assumed to be massless ($m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$).\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n*   **Energy Conservation Equation**:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    where $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$ and $E_{\\nu} = pc$ (for the massless neutrino).\n\n**3. Solve for Momentum and Kinetic Energies**\n\nBy substituting the energy expressions into the conservation of energy equation and solving for the momentum term `pc`, we arrive at the following formula:\n\n$pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\nOnce `pc` is known, we can find the kinetic energies:\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$)**: For a massless particle, its total energy is purely kinetic, so $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu}$)**: The total kinetic energy released (the Q-value) is the difference in rest energies: $KE_{total} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2$. This energy is shared between the products, so $KE_{\\mu} = KE_{total} - KE_{\\nu}$.\n\n**4.

Because the energies involved are comparable to the rest mass energies of the particles, we must use the equations of special relativity.\n\n2.  **State Given Information:**\n    *   Decay process: Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu\n    *   Initial state: The Pi(+) is stationary.\n    *   Rest energy of Pi(+) ($m_{\\pi}c^2$): 139.6 MeV\n    *   Rest energy of mu(+) ($m_{\\mu}c^2$): 105.7 MeV\n    *   Assumption: The neutrino (nu) is massless, so its rest energy is 0.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   Since the initial pion is stationary, its momentum is zero.\n    *   Therefore, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. This means the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu) must travel in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this momentum `p`.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the stationary pion: $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$.\n    *   The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon ($E_{\\mu}$) and the neutrino ($E_{\\nu}$): $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$.\n    *   Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$:\n        *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n        *   For the massless neutrino: $E_{\\nu} = pc$\n    *   Setting initial energy equal to final energy: $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Momentum and Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   The consensus among all correct candidate answers is to first solve for the momentum term, `pc`. By rearranging the energy conservation equation and squaring both sides, we arrive at the formula:\n      $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n    *   Plugging in the values:\n      $pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78$ MeV.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n    *   **KE of the neutrino:** For a massless particle, its total energy is purely kinetic. Therefore, $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc \\approx 29.8$ MeV.\n    *   **KE of the muon:** The total kinetic energy released (the Q-value of the reaction) is the difference in the initial and final rest energies: $KE_{total} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2 = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9$ MeV. This energy is shared between the two products.\n      $KE_{\\mu} = KE_{total} - KE_{\\nu} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 4.12$ MeV.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately **4.12 MeV** for the muon (mu+) and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino (nu).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical:** This problem must be solved using relativistic equations. Classical formulas for kinetic energy and momentum would give an incorrect result.\n*   **Massless Particle Energy:** A key point is that for a massless particle like the neutrino, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy, and is given by $E = pc$.\n*   **Energy Distribution:** The total kinetic energy released is the difference in rest mass before and after the decay. This energy is not shared equally; the much lighter particle (the neutrino) carries away significantly more kinetic energy than the heavier particle (the muon).\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** All 15 candidate answers, despite some confusion in matching their results to the lettered options, performed the same core calculation and arrived at the same numerical results (4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV). The discrepancy in their final letter choices (`<<<A>>>`, `<<<B>>>`, etc.) stems from working with differently ordered lists of options, not from errors in the physics calculation.\n\nMatching our calculated result (4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV) to the options provided in the question:\nA) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis using the principles of special relativity to find the kinetic energies of the particles produced from the decay of a stationary pion.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Governing Principles**: The decay is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the speeds of the resulting particles are a significant fraction of the speed of light, relativistic equations must be used.\n\n2.  **Initial State**:\n    *   The initial particle is a positive pion (π⁺).\n    *   It is stationary, meaning its initial momentum is zero.\n    *   Its total initial energy is its rest mass energy, E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV.\n\n3.  **Final State**:\n    *   The final particles are a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν).\n    *   The rest mass energy of the muon is m_μc² = 105.7 MeV.\n    *   The neutrino is assumed to be massless, so its rest mass energy is m_νc² = 0.\n\n4.  **Conservation of Momentum**:\n    *   Since the initial momentum is zero, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n    *   This implies the muon and neutrino must travel in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this momentum `p`.\n    *   |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n5.  **Conservation of Energy**:\n    *   The initial energy equals the sum of the total final energies: E_initial = E_μ + E_ν.\n    *   We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n        *   For the muon: E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n        *   For the massless neutrino: E_ν = pc. For a massless particle, its total energy is purely kinetic, so KE_ν = pc.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\nThe unanimous approach across all valid analyses is to first solve for the momentum `p` (or more conveniently, the term `pc`).\n\n1.  **Set up the energy conservation equation**:\n    m_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc\n\n2.  **Solve for `pc`**: To solve for `pc`, we isolate the square root and square both sides.\n    m_πc² - pc = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n    (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\n3.  **Simplify**: The (pc)² terms cancel out. We can now solve for `pc`.\n    (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)(pc)\n    pc = [ (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2(m_πc²) ]\n\n4.  **Numerical Calculation**:\n    *   pc = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\n    *   pc = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / 279.2\n    *   pc = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\n5.  **Determine Kinetic Energies**:\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν)**: As established, KE_ν = pc.\n        KE_ν ≈ **29.8 MeV**\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ)**: The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest energies, which is shared between the products: KE_total = KE_μ + KE_ν.\n        KE_total = m_πc² - m_μc² = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n        KE_μ = KE_total - KE_ν\n        KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV ≈ **4.12 MeV**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies for the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (μ⁺) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (ν).

The solution requires applying the fundamental principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum, using the framework of special relativity since the particles' energies are comparable to their rest masses.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial pion (π⁺) is stationary, meaning its initial momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles—the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν)—must be emitted in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's denote this momentum magnitude by `p`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   **Initial Energy:** The energy of the stationary pion is purely its rest mass energy:\n        E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n    *   **Final Energy:** The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\n        E_final = E_μ + E_ν\n    *   Therefore: m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    *   For the massive muon: E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n    *   For the massless neutrino: The rest mass is zero, so its total energy is E_ν = pc. A crucial point is that for a massless particle, its total energy is entirely kinetic energy. Thus, KE_ν = E_ν = pc.\n\n4.  **Solving for the Unknowns:** The most direct method, as correctly identified by all candidate answers, is to solve for the momentum term `pc`.\n    *   Start with the energy conservation equation: m_πc² = E_μ + pc\n    *   Isolate the muon's energy: E_μ = m_πc² - pc\n    *   Substitute this into the muon's energy-momentum relation: (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   Expand the left side: (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   The (pc)² terms cancel out. Rearranging to solve for `pc` gives the standard formula for a two-body decay:\n        pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   Substitute the given values:\n        pc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n        pc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n        pc = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):** As established, KE_ν = pc.\n        KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):** The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in the initial and final rest masses, which is shared between the products.\n        KE_total = m_πc² - m_μc² = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n        This total kinetic energy is the sum of the products' kinetic energies: KE_total = KE_μ + KE_ν.\n        KE_μ = KE_total - KE_ν = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies for the product particles are approximately **4.12 MeV** for the muon (μ⁺) and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino (ν). Comparing this result with the provided options:\n\n*   **A) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV**\n*   B) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n*   C) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n*   D) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values are a perfect match for option A.
