The von Neumann entropy `S(rho)` for any pure state is always zero. This is a fundamental principle that provides a major simplification.\n\nTherefore, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state `tau`:\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n### **Step 2: Characterize the Reference Gaussian State `tau`**\n\nThe reference state `tau` is defined as the Gaussian state that has the same first and second statistical moments as our state `rho`.\n\n*   **First Moment (Displacement):**\n    With the given parameter `phi = -pi/4`, the state `|psi>` becomes proportional to `(|alpha> - |-alpha>)`. This is known as an \"odd\" Schrödinger cat state.\n    **Careful Point 2:** Due to the symmetry of this odd cat state, its first moment (the expectation value of the annihilation operator `a`) is zero. `<a> = 0`. This means the reference state `tau` must also be a centered Gaussian state.\n\n*   **Second Moments (Covariance):**\n    A centered Gaussian state is fully described by its second moments: the mean photon number `<n> = <a†a>` and the squeezing term `<a^2>`. For the odd cat state, these are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n    *   `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n    **Careful Point 3:** Since `alpha` is not zero, the term `<a^2>` is also not zero. This means the reference state `tau` is not a simple thermal state (for which `<a^2>` would be zero), but a **squeezed thermal state**.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Entropy of the Reference State `S(tau)`**\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by its symplectic eigenvalue, `nu`. The formula for the entropy is:\n`S(tau) = (nu + 1/2) * ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2) * ln(nu - 1/2)`\n\nThe symplectic eigenvalue `nu` is calculated from the second moments using the formula:\n`nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`\n\n### **Step 4: Perform the Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe now substitute the given parameter `alpha = 0.5` into the formulas.\n\n1.  `alpha^2 = 0.5^2 = 0.25`\n2.  Calculate the moments:\n    *   `<a^2> = 0.25`\n    *   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`\n    Using a calculator, `coth(0.25) = (e^0.5 + 1) / (e^0.5 - 1) ≈ 4.0829`.\n    So, `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.0829 ≈ 1.0207`.\n3.  Calculate `nu^2`:\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.0207 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.5207)^2 - 0.0625`\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ 2.3125 - 0.0625 = 2.25`\n    **Careful Point 4:** The parameters of the problem are chosen such that this calculation yields an exact result: `nu^2 = 2.25`.\n4.  Calculate `nu`:\n    *   `nu = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`\n5.  Calculate the entropy `S(tau)`:\n    *   `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n    *   Since `ln(1) = 0`, this simplifies to `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2)`.\n6.  Final Value:\n    *   `nG = S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated value for the non-Gaussianity is approximately `1.386`. We compare this to the options provided in the original question:\nA) 0.25\nB) 0\nC) 1.38\nD) 2.48\n\nThe calculated value `1.386` is best represented by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct methodology from the provided answers.\n\n### **1. Simplification of the Non-Gaussianity (nG) Measure**\n\nThe first crucial step is to simplify the given formula for non-Gaussianity (nG).\n*   The measure is the relative entropy: `del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho)) - trace(tau* ln(tau))]`.\n*   Using the definition of von Neumann entropy, `S(σ) = -trace(σ ln σ)`, the formula becomes `nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`.\n*   The state `|psi>` is a pure quantum state. A fundamental principle of quantum information is that the von Neumann entropy of any pure state is zero. Therefore, `S(rho) = 0`.\n*   This simplifies the entire problem to calculating the entropy of the reference Gaussian state: `nG = S(tau)`.\n\n### **2. Characterization of the Quantum State**\n\nNext, we must understand the specific state we are working with, given the parameters `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`.\n*   Substituting `phi = -pi/4` into the state definition `|psi> =( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N` gives:\n    `|psi> ∝ ( (1/√2)|alpha> - (1/√2)|-alpha> )`\n*   This simplifies to `|psi> ∝ (|alpha> - |-alpha>)`. This specific superposition is known as an \"odd Schrödinger cat state\".\n\n### **3. Determining the Reference Gaussian State (τ)**\n\nThe reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state that, by definition, must have the same first and second statistical moments as our state `rho`.\n\n*   **First Moment (Displacement):** For the odd cat state, the expectation value of the annihilation operator, `<a>`, is zero due to the state's symmetry in phase space. This means the reference state `tau` must also be a centered Gaussian state (`<a>_tau = 0`).\n*   **Second Moments (Covariance):** A centered Gaussian state is fully described by its second moments: the mean photon number `<n> = <a†a>` and the squeezing term `<a^2>`. For the odd cat state, the standard formulas for these moments are:\n    *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n    *   `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n*   **Careful Point:** Since `alpha = 0.5`, `<a^2> = 0.25` is non-zero. This is a critical detail. It means the reference state `tau` is not a simple thermal state (for which `<a^2>` would be zero), but a **squeezed thermal state**.\n\n### **4. Calculating the Entropy of the Reference State S(τ)**\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by its symplectic eigenvalue, `ν`.\n\n*   The entropy is given by the formula:\n    `S(tau) = (ν + 1/2) * ln(ν + 1/2) - (ν - 1/2) * ln(ν - 1/2)`\n*   The symplectic eigenvalue `ν` is calculated from the second moments:\n    `ν^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`\n\n### **5. Performing the Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe now substitute the parameter `alpha = 0.5` into the formulas.\n\n1.  `alpha^2 = 0.25`\n2.  Calculate the moments:\n    *   `<a^2> = 0.25`\n    *   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`\n3.  Evaluate `coth(0.25)`:\n    *   `coth(0.25) = (e^0.5 + 1) / (e^0.5 - 1) ≈ 4.0829`\n    *   `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.0829 ≈ 1.0207`\n4.  Calculate `ν^2`:\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.0207 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.5207)^2 - 0.0625`\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ 2.3125 - 0.0625 = 2.25`\n    **Careful Point:** The calculation yields exactly 2.25, indicating the problem's parameters were chosen for a clean result.\n5.  Calculate `ν`:\n    *   `ν = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`\n6.  Finally, calculate the entropy `S(tau)`:\n    *   `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n7.  Since `ln(1) = 0`, the final result is:\n    *   `nG = S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated value for the non-Gaussianity is approximately **1.386**. Comparing this to the original options:\nA) 2.48\nB) 1.38\nC) 0.25\nD) 0\n\nThe calculated value is best represented by option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Plan and Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem**: The goal is to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a specific Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The key parameters are `alpha = 0.5` and `phi = -pi/4`.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Non-Gaussianity Formula**: The measure is `nG = trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau))`. Using the definition of von Neumann entropy, `S(x) = -trace(x*ln(x))`, this becomes `nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`.\n    *   **Careful Point 1**: The state `|psi>` is a pure quantum state. The von Neumann entropy of any pure state is zero. Therefore, `S(rho) = 0`. This is a crucial simplification that reduces the problem to finding the entropy of the reference Gaussian state: `nG = S(tau)`.\n\n3.  **Characterize the Reference State `tau`**: The state `tau` is a Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as `rho`.\n    *   **Careful Point 2**: With `phi = -pi/4`, the state becomes an \"odd cat state,\" `|psi> ∝ (|alpha> - |-alpha>)`. Due to symmetry, its first moment (mean displacement) `<a>` is zero. This means `tau` is a centered Gaussian state.\n    *   **Careful Point 3**: A centered Gaussian state is defined by its second moments: the mean photon number `<n> = <a†a>` and the squeezing term `<a^2>`. For an odd cat state, the correct formulas are:\n        *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n        *   `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n        Since `<a^2>` is non-zero, `tau` is a squeezed thermal state, not a simple thermal state.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Entropy of `tau`**: The entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by its symplectic eigenvalue, `nu`.\n    *   **Careful Point 4**: The symplectic eigenvalue `nu` is calculated from the second moments using the formula: `nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`.\n    *   The entropy is then given by: `S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2)`.\n\n5.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation**: The final step is to substitute `alpha = 0.5` into the formulas and compute the result. This is best done with code to ensure accuracy. The calculation should yield `nu = 1.5` exactly, which simplifies the entropy calculation to `S(tau) = 2*ln(2)`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this step-by-step plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_non_gaussianity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state\n    based on the relative entropy measure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the parameters from the problem.\n    alpha = 0.5\n    phi = -np.pi / 4\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis:\")\n    print(\"1.

Understand the Goal and Simplify the Formula**\n\nThe primary goal is to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a specific Schrödinger cat state. The measure provided is the relative entropy:\n`del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho)) - trace(tau* ln(tau))]`\n\nThis formula can be rewritten using the definition of von Neumann entropy, `S(σ) = -trace(σ * ln(σ))`.\n`nG = del_b = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The state `|psi>` is a state vector, which represents a **pure quantum state**. The density matrix is `rho = |psi><psi|`. A fundamental property of any pure state is that its von Neumann entropy is zero.\n*   `S(rho) = 0`\n\nThis simplifies the problem significantly. The non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state `tau`.\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n**2. Determine the Properties of the Reference Gaussian State (τ)**\n\nThe reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state that is defined to have the same first and second statistical moments as the state `rho`.\n\n*   **State Characterization:** With the given parameters `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`, the state `|psi>` becomes proportional to `(|alpha> - |-alpha>)`. This is known as an \"odd\" Schrödinger cat state.\n\n*   **First Moment (Displacement):** We need to find `<a> = <psi|a|psi>`.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** Due to the symmetry of the odd cat state (it is an eigenstate of the parity operator with eigenvalue -1), its average displacement is zero. `<a> = 0`.\n    *   Therefore, the reference state `tau` must also be a centered Gaussian state.\n\n*   **Second Moments (Covariance):** A centered Gaussian state is fully described by its second moments: the mean photon number `<n> = <a†a>` and the squeezing term `<a^2>`. These must match the moments of the odd cat state. The standard formulas are:\n    *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n    *   `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** It is crucial to recognize that since `<a^2>` is non-zero, the reference state `tau` is not a simple thermal state, but a **squeezed thermal state**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Entropy of the Reference State S(τ)**\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by its symplectic eigenvalue, `ν`.

Calculate the moments for `rho`:\n    *   `<a^2> = 0.25`\n    *   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`\n3.  Evaluate `<n>`:\n    *   `coth(0.25) = (e^(2*0.25) + 1) / (e^(2*0.25) - 1) = (e^0.5 + 1) / (e^0.5 - 1) ≈ 4.0829`\n    *   `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.0829 ≈ 1.0207`\n4.

Simplification of the Non-Gaussianity (nG) Measure**\n\n*   The non-Gaussianity is defined by the relative entropy: `del_b = trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau))`.\n*   Using the definition of von Neumann entropy, `S(σ) = -trace(σ*ln(σ))`, the measure becomes `nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The state `|psi>` is a pure quantum state. A fundamental property of any pure state is that its von Neumann entropy is zero. Therefore, `S(rho) = 0`.\n*   This simplifies the problem significantly: the non-Gaussianity is equal to the entropy of the reference Gaussian state, `nG = S(tau)`.\n\n**2. Characterization of the Reference Gaussian State (τ)**\n\n*   The reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state that must have the same first and second statistical moments as the state of interest, `rho`.\n*   The parameters are `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`. For this phase, the state `|psi>` becomes an \"odd\" Schrödinger cat state, proportional to `(|alpha> - |-alpha>)`.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** Due to the symmetry of the odd cat state, its first moment (mean displacement) is zero: `<a> = 0`. This means the reference state `tau` must also be a centered Gaussian state.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** A centered Gaussian state is defined by its second moments: the mean photon number `<n> = <a†a>` and the squeezing term `<a^2>`. One must use the correct formulas for the odd cat state:\n    *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n    *   `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n    A common error is to assume `tau` is a simple thermal state (where `<a^2>=0`), but since `alpha` is non-zero, `<a^2>` is also non-zero. Thus, `tau` is a **squeezed thermal state**.\n\n**3.

The standard formulas are:\n        *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n        *   `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n    *   Since `alpha = 0.5`, `<a^2> = 0.25` is non-zero. This confirms the reference state `tau` is a **squeezed thermal state**.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Entropy of `tau`**\n\n*   The entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by its symplectic eigenvalue, `ν`.\n*   The formula for the entropy is: `S(tau) = (ν + 1/2) * ln(ν + 1/2) - (ν - 1/2) * ln(ν - 1/2)`.\n*   **Careful Point**: The symplectic eigenvalue `ν` is calculated from the second moments using the specific formula for a centered Gaussian state: `ν^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`.\n\n**4.

Simplification of the Non-Gaussianity (nG) Measure**\n\nThe first step is to understand and simplify the formula for non-Gaussianity (nG).\n*   The measure is the relative entropy: `del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho)) - trace(tau* ln(tau))]`.\n*   Using the definition of von Neumann entropy, `S(σ) = -trace(σ ln σ)`, the measure can be rewritten as: `nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The state `|psi>` is a pure quantum state. The von Neumann entropy `S(rho)` for any pure state is zero. This is a critical simplification.\n*   Therefore, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state `tau`: `nG = S(tau)`.\n\n### **2. Determining the Reference Gaussian State (τ)**\n\nThe reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state that must have the same first and second statistical moments as the state `rho`.\n\n*   **State Identification:** With the given parameters `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`, the state `|psi>` becomes proportional to `(|alpha> - |-alpha>)`. This is known as an \"odd Schrödinger cat state\".\n*   **First Moment (Displacement):** Due to the symmetry of the odd cat state, the expectation value of the annihilation operator `<a>` is zero. This means the reference state `tau` is a centered Gaussian state.\n*   **Second Moments (Covariance):** A centered Gaussian state is fully characterized by its second moments: the mean photon number `<n> = <a†a>` and the squeezing term `<a^2>`.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The reference state `tau` must match these moments from `rho`. For the odd cat state, the standard formulas are:\n    *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n    *   `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n*   **Careful Point 3:** A common mistake is to assume the reference state is a simple thermal state (where `<a^2>=0`). Since `alpha` is not zero, `<a^2>` is also not zero. This means the reference state `tau` must be a **squeezed thermal state**.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Entropy of the Reference State S(τ)**\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by its symplectic eigenvalue, `ν`.\n\n*   The formula for the entropy is: `S(tau) = (ν + 1/2) * ln(ν + 1/2) - (ν - 1/2) * ln(ν - 1/2)`.\n*   The symplectic eigenvalue `ν` is calculated from the second moments: `ν^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`.\n\n### **4. Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe now substitute the given parameter `alpha = 0.5`:\n\n1.  `alpha^2 = 0.25`.\n2.  The moments are:\n    *   `<a^2> = 0.25`.\n    *   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`.\n3.  Evaluating `<n>`:\n    *   `coth(0.25) = (e^0.5 + 1) / (e^0.5 - 1) ≈ 4.0829`.\n    *   `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.0829 ≈ 1.0207`.\n4.  Calculating the symplectic eigenvalue `ν`:\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.0207 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`.\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.5207)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.3125 - 0.0625 = 2.25`.\n5.  **Careful Point 4:** The parameters of the problem are deliberately chosen so that the result is exact: `ν^2 = 2.25`. This gives `ν = 1.5`.\n6.  Finally, we calculate the entropy `S(tau)` with `ν = 1.5`:\n    *   `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)`.\n    *   `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`.\n7.  Since `ln(1) = 0`, the result simplifies to `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2)`.\n8.  The final numerical value is: `nG = S(tau) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`.\n\n### **5.

A fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is that the von Neumann entropy of any pure state is zero. Therefore, `S(rho) = 0`.\n*   **Careful Point 1**: The problem simplifies significantly to calculating the entropy of the reference Gaussian state: `nG = S(tau)`.

Simplification of the Non-Gaussianity (nG) Measure**\n*   The measure of non-Gaussianity is the relative entropy: `nG = del_b = trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau))`.\n*   Using the definition of von Neumann entropy, `S(σ) = -trace(σ*ln(σ))`, this becomes `nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`.\n*   **Careful Point:** The state `|psi>` is a pure quantum state. The von Neumann entropy of any pure state is zero. Therefore, `S(rho) = 0`.\n*   This simplifies the problem significantly: the non-Gaussianity is equal to the entropy of the reference Gaussian state, `nG = S(tau)`. All correct analyses agree on this crucial first step.\n\n**2. Characterization of the Reference Gaussian State (τ)**\n*   The reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state that must have the same first and second statistical moments as the state of interest, `rho`.\n*   **First Moment:** For the given phase `phi = -pi/4`, the state is an \"odd Schrödinger cat state,\" `|psi> ∝ (|alpha> - |-alpha>)`. Due to its symmetry, the first moment (mean displacement) `<a>` is zero. This means `tau` is a centered Gaussian state.\n*   **Second Moments:** A centered Gaussian state is defined by its second moments: the mean photon number `<n> = <a†a>` and the squeezing term `<a^2>`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A common mistake is to assume the reference state is a simple thermal state. However, for the odd cat state, `<a^2> = alpha^2 = 0.5^2 = 0.25`, which is non-zero. This means the reference state `tau` must be a **squeezed thermal state**, not a simple thermal state. The correct formulas for the moments are:\n    *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n    *   `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n\n**3. Calculation of the Entropy of the Reference State S(τ)**\n*   The entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by its symplectic eigenvalue, `ν`.\n*   The formula for the entropy is: `S(tau) = (ν + 1/2) * ln(ν + 1/2) - (ν - 1/2) * ln(ν - 1/2)`.\n*   The symplectic eigenvalue `ν` is calculated from the second moments using the formula: `ν^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`.\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\n*   Substitute the parameter `alpha = 0.5`, which gives `alpha^2 = 0.25`.\n*   Calculate the moments:\n    *   `<a^2> = 0.25`\n    *   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25) ≈ 0.25 * 4.0829 ≈ 1.0207`\n*   Calculate the square of the symplectic eigenvalue:\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.0207 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.5207)^2 - 0.0625`\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ 2.3125 - 0.0625 = 2.25`\n*   **Careful Point:** The parameters of the problem are deliberately chosen to yield an exact, clean intermediate result.\n    *   `ν = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`\n*   Finally, calculate the entropy `S(tau)` with `ν = 1.5`:\n    *   `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n    *   Since `ln(1) = 0`, the result is `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2)`.\n*   The final numerical value is:\n    *   `nG = S(tau) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`\n\n**5.

Deconstruction and Simplification of the Problem**\n\nThe primary goal is to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a specific Schrödinger cat state.\n\n*   **State:** `|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`\n*   **Parameters:** `phi = -pi/4`, `alpha = 0.5`\n*   **Measure of nG:** The relative entropy, `del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho)) - trace(tau* ln(tau))]`.\n\nThis expression can be rewritten using the von Neumann entropy, `S(σ) = -trace(σ ln σ)`, which gives:\n`nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\n**Careful Point 1: Purity of the State**\nThe state `|psi>` is given as a state vector, which represents a **pure quantum state**. A fundamental property of any pure state is that its von Neumann entropy is zero.\n*   `S(rho) = 0`\n\nThis simplifies the problem significantly. The non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state `tau`.\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n### **2. Determining the Reference Gaussian State `tau`**\n\nThe reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state that, by definition, has the same first and second statistical moments as the state `rho`.\n\n*   **First Moment (Displacement):**\n    With `phi = -pi/4`, the state becomes `|psi> ∝ (|alpha> - |-alpha>)`. This is known as an \"odd\" cat state. Due to its symmetry around the origin in phase space, the expectation value of the annihilation operator `<a>` is zero. Therefore, the reference state `tau` is a centered Gaussian state.\n\n*   **Second Moments (Covariance):**\n    A centered Gaussian state is fully described by its second moments: the mean photon number `<n> = <a†a>` and the squeezing term `<a^2>`. For the odd cat state, these are given by standard formulas:\n    *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n    *   `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n\n**Careful Point 2: Nature of the Reference State**\nSince `alpha = 0.5`, the squeezing term `<a^2> = 0.25` is non-zero. This means the reference state `tau` is not a simple thermal state (which would have `<a^2> = 0`), but rather a **squeezed thermal state**. This is a crucial physical detail.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Entropy of the Reference State `S(tau)`**\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is a function of its symplectic eigenvalue, `nu`.\n\n*   **Entropy Formula:** `S(tau) = (nu + 1/2) * ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2) * ln(nu - 1/2)`\n*   **Symplectic Eigenvalue Formula:** `nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`\n\n### **4. Performing the Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe now substitute the parameter `alpha = 0.5` into the formulas.\n\n1.  `alpha^2 = 0.25`\n2.  Calculate the moments:\n    *   `<a^2> = 0.25`\n    *   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`\n3.  Evaluate `<n>`:\n    *   `coth(0.25) = (e^0.5 + 1) / (e^0.5 - 1) ≈ 4.0829`\n    *   `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.0829 ≈ 1.0207`\n4.  Calculate `nu^2`:\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.0207 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.5207)^2 - 0.0625`\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ 2.3125 - 0.0625 = 2.25`\n\n**Careful Point 3: Exact Intermediate Result**\nThe problem parameters are deliberately chosen so that the calculation yields an exact, simple number.\n*   `nu^2 = 2.25`\n*   `nu = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`\n\n5.  Calculate the final entropy `S(tau)`:\n    *   `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n    *   Since `ln(1) = 0`, the expression simplifies to `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2)`.\n6.  Final Value:\n    *   `nG = 2 * ln(2) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated value for the non-Gaussianity is approximately **1.386**.

The von Neumann entropy, `S(rho)`, of any pure state is always zero. This is a fundamental concept that provides the first major simplification.\n\nTherefore, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state:\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n**2.

Now, we calculate `ν^2`:\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.0207 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.5207)^2 - 0.0625`\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ 2.3125 - 0.0625 = 2.25`\n    The fact that this result is exactly 2.25 indicates the problem parameters were chosen for a clean solution.\n5.  Calculate `ν`:\n    *   `ν = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`\n6.

Simplification of the Non-Gaussianity (nG) Measure**\n\nThe first and most important step is to simplify the given formula for non-Gaussianity.\n*   The measure is the relative entropy: `nG = del_b = trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau))`.\n*   Using the definition of von Neumann entropy, `S(σ) = -trace(σ*ln(σ))`, the formula can be rewritten as: `nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The state `|psi>` is a pure quantum state.

This means the reference state `tau` must be a centered Gaussian state.\n*   **Second Moments (Covariance):** A centered Gaussian state is fully characterized by its second moments: the mean photon number `<n> = <a†a>` and the squeezing term `<a^2>`.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The reference state `tau` must match these moments from `rho`. For the odd cat state, the standard formulas are:\n    *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n    *   `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n*   **Careful Point 3:** A common mistake is to assume the reference state is a simple thermal state (where `<a^2>=0`).

This is a fundamental principle that provides a major simplification.\n\nTherefore, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state `tau`:\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n### **Step 2: Characterize the Reference Gaussian State `tau`**\n\nThe reference state `tau` is defined as the Gaussian state that has the same first and second statistical moments as our state `rho`.\n\n*   **First Moment (Displacement):**\n    With the given parameter `phi = -pi/4`, the state `|psi>` becomes proportional to `(|alpha> - |-alpha>)`. This is known as an \"odd\" Schrödinger cat state.\n    **Careful Point 2:** Due to the symmetry of this odd cat state, its first moment (the expectation value of the annihilation operator `a`) is zero. `<a> = 0`. This means the reference state `tau` must also be a centered Gaussian state.\n\n*   **Second Moments (Covariance):**\n    A centered Gaussian state is fully described by its second moments: the mean photon number `<n> = <a†a>` and the squeezing term `<a^2>`. For the odd cat state, these are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n    *   `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n    **Careful Point 3:** Since `alpha` is not zero, the term `<a^2>` is also not zero. This means the reference state `tau` is not a simple thermal state (for which `<a^2>` would be zero), but a **squeezed thermal state**.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Entropy of the Reference State `S(tau)`**\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by its symplectic eigenvalue, `nu`. The formula for the entropy is:\n`S(tau) = (nu + 1/2) * ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2) * ln(nu - 1/2)`\n\nThe symplectic eigenvalue `nu` is calculated from the second moments using the formula:\n`nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`\n\n### **Step 4: Perform the Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe now substitute the given parameter `alpha = 0.5` into the formulas.\n\n1.  `alpha^2 = 0.5^2 = 0.25`\n2.  Calculate the moments:\n    *   `<a^2> = 0.25`\n    *   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`\n    Using a calculator, `coth(0.25) = (e^0.5 + 1) / (e^0.5 - 1) ≈ 4.0829`.\n    So, `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.0829 ≈ 1.0207`.\n3.  Calculate `nu^2`:\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.0207 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.5207)^2 - 0.0625`\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ 2.3125 - 0.0625 = 2.25`\n    **Careful Point 4:** The parameters of the problem are chosen such that this calculation yields an exact result: `nu^2 = 2.25`.\n4.  Calculate `nu`:\n    *   `nu = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`\n5.  Calculate the entropy `S(tau)`:\n    *   `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n    *   Since `ln(1) = 0`, this simplifies to `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2)`.\n6.  Final Value:\n    *   `nG = S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated value for the non-Gaussianity is approximately `1.386`. We compare this to the options provided in the original question:\nA) 0.25\nB) 0\nC) 1.38\nD) 2.48\n\nThe calculated value `1.386` is best represented by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct methodology from the provided answers.\n\n### **1. Simplification of the Non-Gaussianity (nG) Measure**\n\nThe first crucial step is to simplify the given formula for non-Gaussianity (nG).\n*   The measure is the relative entropy: `del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho)) - trace(tau* ln(tau))]`.\n*   Using the definition of von Neumann entropy, `S(σ) = -trace(σ ln σ)`, the formula becomes `nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`.\n*   The state `|psi>` is a pure quantum state. A fundamental principle of quantum information is that the von Neumann entropy of any pure state is zero. Therefore, `S(rho) = 0`.\n*   This simplifies the entire problem to calculating the entropy of the reference Gaussian state: `nG = S(tau)`.\n\n### **2. Characterization of the Quantum State**\n\nNext, we must understand the specific state we are working with, given the parameters `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`.\n*   Substituting `phi = -pi/4` into the state definition `|psi> =( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N` gives:\n    `|psi> ∝ ( (1/√2)|alpha> - (1/√2)|-alpha> )`\n*   This simplifies to `|psi> ∝ (|alpha> - |-alpha>)`. This specific superposition is known as an \"odd Schrödinger cat state\".\n\n### **3. Determining the Reference Gaussian State (τ)**\n\nThe reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state that, by definition, must have the same first and second statistical moments as our state `rho`.\n\n*   **First Moment (Displacement):** For the odd cat state, the expectation value of the annihilation operator, `<a>`, is zero due to the state's symmetry in phase space. This means the reference state `tau` must also be a centered Gaussian state (`<a>_tau = 0`).\n*   **Second Moments (Covariance):** A centered Gaussian state is fully described by its second moments: the mean photon number `<n> = <a†a>` and the squeezing term `<a^2>`. For the odd cat state, the standard formulas for these moments are:\n    *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n    *   `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n*   **Careful Point:** Since `alpha = 0.5`, `<a^2> = 0.25` is non-zero. This is a critical detail. It means the reference state `tau` is not a simple thermal state (for which `<a^2>` would be zero), but a **squeezed thermal state**.\n\n### **4. Calculating the Entropy of the Reference State S(τ)**\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by its symplectic eigenvalue, `ν`.\n\n*   The entropy is given by the formula:\n    `S(tau) = (ν + 1/2) * ln(ν + 1/2) - (ν - 1/2) * ln(ν - 1/2)`\n*   The symplectic eigenvalue `ν` is calculated from the second moments:\n    `ν^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`\n\n### **5. Performing the Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe now substitute the parameter `alpha = 0.5` into the formulas.\n\n1.  `alpha^2 = 0.25`\n2.  Calculate the moments:\n    *   `<a^2> = 0.25`\n    *   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`\n3.  Evaluate `coth(0.25)`:\n    *   `coth(0.25) = (e^0.5 + 1) / (e^0.5 - 1) ≈ 4.0829`\n    *   `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.0829 ≈ 1.0207`\n4.  Calculate `ν^2`:\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.0207 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.5207)^2 - 0.0625`\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ 2.3125 - 0.0625 = 2.25`\n    **Careful Point:** The calculation yields exactly 2.25, indicating the problem's parameters were chosen for a clean result.\n5.  Calculate `ν`:\n    *   `ν = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`\n6.  Finally, calculate the entropy `S(tau)`:\n    *   `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n7.  Since `ln(1) = 0`, the final result is:\n    *   `nG = S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated value for the non-Gaussianity is approximately **1.386**. Comparing this to the original options:\nA) 2.48\nB) 1.38\nC) 0.25\nD) 0\n\nThe calculated value is best represented by option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Plan and Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem**: The goal is to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a specific Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The key parameters are `alpha = 0.5` and `phi = -pi/4`.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Non-Gaussianity Formula**: The measure is `nG = trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau))`. Using the definition of von Neumann entropy, `S(x) = -trace(x*ln(x))`, this becomes `nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`.\n    *   **Careful Point 1**: The state `|psi>` is a pure quantum state. The von Neumann entropy of any pure state is zero. Therefore, `S(rho) = 0`. This is a crucial simplification that reduces the problem to finding the entropy of the reference Gaussian state: `nG = S(tau)`.\n\n3.  **Characterize the Reference State `tau`**: The state `tau` is a Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as `rho`.\n    *   **Careful Point 2**: With `phi = -pi/4`, the state becomes an \"odd cat state,\" `|psi> ∝ (|alpha> - |-alpha>)`. Due to symmetry, its first moment (mean displacement) `<a>` is zero. This means `tau` is a centered Gaussian state.\n    *   **Careful Point 3**: A centered Gaussian state is defined by its second moments: the mean photon number `<n> = <a†a>` and the squeezing term `<a^2>`. For an odd cat state, the correct formulas are:\n        *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n        *   `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n        Since `<a^2>` is non-zero, `tau` is a squeezed thermal state, not a simple thermal state.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Entropy of `tau`**: The entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by its symplectic eigenvalue, `nu`.\n    *   **Careful Point 4**: The symplectic eigenvalue `nu` is calculated from the second moments using the formula: `nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`.\n    *   The entropy is then given by: `S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2)`.\n\n5.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation**: The final step is to substitute `alpha = 0.5` into the formulas and compute the result. This is best done with code to ensure accuracy. The calculation should yield `nu = 1.5` exactly, which simplifies the entropy calculation to `S(tau) = 2*ln(2)`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this step-by-step plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_non_gaussianity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state\n    based on the relative entropy measure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the parameters from the problem.\n    alpha = 0.5\n    phi = -np.pi / 4\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis:\")\n    print(\"1.

Understand the Goal and Simplify the Formula**\n\nThe primary goal is to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a specific Schrödinger cat state. The measure provided is the relative entropy:\n`del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho)) - trace(tau* ln(tau))]`\n\nThis formula can be rewritten using the definition of von Neumann entropy, `S(σ) = -trace(σ * ln(σ))`.\n`nG = del_b = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The state `|psi>` is a state vector, which represents a **pure quantum state**. The density matrix is `rho = |psi><psi|`. A fundamental property of any pure state is that its von Neumann entropy is zero.\n*   `S(rho) = 0`\n\nThis simplifies the problem significantly.

A fundamental property of any pure state is that its von Neumann entropy is zero. Therefore, `S(rho) = 0`.\n*   This simplifies the problem significantly: the non-Gaussianity is equal to the entropy of the reference Gaussian state, `nG = S(tau)`.\n\n**2.

Simplification of the Non-Gaussianity (nG) Measure**\n\nThe first step is to understand and simplify the formula for non-Gaussianity (nG).\n*   The measure is the relative entropy: `del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho)) - trace(tau* ln(tau))]`.\n*   Using the definition of von Neumann entropy, `S(σ) = -trace(σ ln σ)`, the measure can be rewritten as: `nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The state `|psi>` is a pure quantum state. The von Neumann entropy `S(rho)` for any pure state is zero. This is a critical simplification.\n*   Therefore, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state `tau`: `nG = S(tau)`.\n\n### **2. Determining the Reference Gaussian State (τ)**\n\nThe reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state that must have the same first and second statistical moments as the state `rho`.\n\n*   **State Identification:** With the given parameters `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`, the state `|psi>` becomes proportional to `(|alpha> - |-alpha>)`. This is known as an \"odd Schrödinger cat state\".\n*   **First Moment (Displacement):** Due to the symmetry of the odd cat state, the expectation value of the annihilation operator `<a>` is zero. This means the reference state `tau` is a centered Gaussian state.\n*   **Second Moments (Covariance):** A centered Gaussian state is fully characterized by its second moments: the mean photon number `<n> = <a†a>` and the squeezing term `<a^2>`.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The reference state `tau` must match these moments from `rho`. For the odd cat state, the standard formulas are:\n    *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n    *   `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n*   **Careful Point 3:** A common mistake is to assume the reference state is a simple thermal state (where `<a^2>=0`). Since `alpha` is not zero, `<a^2>` is also not zero. This means the reference state `tau` must be a **squeezed thermal state**.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Entropy of the Reference State S(τ)**\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by its symplectic eigenvalue, `ν`.\n\n*   The formula for the entropy is: `S(tau) = (ν + 1/2) * ln(ν + 1/2) - (ν - 1/2) * ln(ν - 1/2)`.\n*   The symplectic eigenvalue `ν` is calculated from the second moments: `ν^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`.\n\n### **4. Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe now substitute the given parameter `alpha = 0.5`:\n\n1.  `alpha^2 = 0.25`.\n2.  The moments are:\n    *   `<a^2> = 0.25`.\n    *   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`.\n3.  Evaluating `<n>`:\n    *   `coth(0.25) = (e^0.5 + 1) / (e^0.5 - 1) ≈ 4.0829`.\n    *   `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.0829 ≈ 1.0207`.\n4.  Calculating the symplectic eigenvalue `ν`:\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.0207 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`.\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.5207)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.3125 - 0.0625 = 2.25`.\n5.  **Careful Point 4:** The parameters of the problem are deliberately chosen so that the result is exact: `ν^2 = 2.25`. This gives `ν = 1.5`.\n6.  Finally, we calculate the entropy `S(tau)` with `ν = 1.5`:\n    *   `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)`.\n    *   `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`.\n7.  Since `ln(1) = 0`, the result simplifies to `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2)`.\n8.  The final numerical value is: `nG = S(tau) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`.\n\n### **5.

This means `tau` is a centered Gaussian state.\n*   **Second Moments:** A centered Gaussian state is defined by its second moments: the mean photon number `<n> = <a†a>` and the squeezing term `<a^2>`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A common mistake is to assume the reference state is a simple thermal state. However, for the odd cat state, `<a^2> = alpha^2 = 0.5^2 = 0.25`, which is non-zero. This means the reference state `tau` must be a **squeezed thermal state**, not a simple thermal state. The correct formulas for the moments are:\n    *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n    *   `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n\n**3. Calculation of the Entropy of the Reference State S(τ)**\n*   The entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by its symplectic eigenvalue, `ν`.\n*   The formula for the entropy is: `S(tau) = (ν + 1/2) * ln(ν + 1/2) - (ν - 1/2) * ln(ν - 1/2)`.\n*   The symplectic eigenvalue `ν` is calculated from the second moments using the formula: `ν^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`.\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\n*   Substitute the parameter `alpha = 0.5`, which gives `alpha^2 = 0.25`.\n*   Calculate the moments:\n    *   `<a^2> = 0.25`\n    *   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25) ≈ 0.25 * 4.0829 ≈ 1.0207`\n*   Calculate the square of the symplectic eigenvalue:\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.0207 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.5207)^2 - 0.0625`\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ 2.3125 - 0.0625 = 2.25`\n*   **Careful Point:** The parameters of the problem are deliberately chosen to yield an exact, clean intermediate result.\n    *   `ν = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`\n*   Finally, calculate the entropy `S(tau)` with `ν = 1.5`:\n    *   `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n    *   Since `ln(1) = 0`, the result is `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2)`.\n*   The final numerical value is:\n    *   `nG = S(tau) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`\n\n**5.

Deconstruction and Simplification of the Problem**\n\nThe primary goal is to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a specific Schrödinger cat state.\n\n*   **State:** `|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`\n*   **Parameters:** `phi = -pi/4`, `alpha = 0.5`\n*   **Measure of nG:** The relative entropy, `del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho)) - trace(tau* ln(tau))]`.\n\nThis expression can be rewritten using the von Neumann entropy, `S(σ) = -trace(σ ln σ)`, which gives:\n`nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\n**Careful Point 1: Purity of the State**\nThe state `|psi>` is given as a state vector, which represents a **pure quantum state**. A fundamental property of any pure state is that its von Neumann entropy is zero.\n*   `S(rho) = 0`\n\nThis simplifies the problem significantly. The non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state `tau`.\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n### **2. Determining the Reference Gaussian State `tau`**\n\nThe reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state that, by definition, has the same first and second statistical moments as the state `rho`.\n\n*   **First Moment (Displacement):**\n    With `phi = -pi/4`, the state becomes `|psi> ∝ (|alpha> - |-alpha>)`. This is known as an \"odd\" cat state. Due to its symmetry around the origin in phase space, the expectation value of the annihilation operator `<a>` is zero. Therefore, the reference state `tau` is a centered Gaussian state.\n\n*   **Second Moments (Covariance):**\n    A centered Gaussian state is fully described by its second moments: the mean photon number `<n> = <a†a>` and the squeezing term `<a^2>`. For the odd cat state, these are given by standard formulas:\n    *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n    *   `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n\n**Careful Point 2: Nature of the Reference State**\nSince `alpha = 0.5`, the squeezing term `<a^2> = 0.25` is non-zero. This means the reference state `tau` is not a simple thermal state (which would have `<a^2> = 0`), but rather a **squeezed thermal state**. This is a crucial physical detail.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Entropy of the Reference State `S(tau)`**\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is a function of its symplectic eigenvalue, `nu`.\n\n*   **Entropy Formula:** `S(tau) = (nu + 1/2) * ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2) * ln(nu - 1/2)`\n*   **Symplectic Eigenvalue Formula:** `nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`\n\n### **4. Performing the Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe now substitute the parameter `alpha = 0.5` into the formulas.\n\n1.  `alpha^2 = 0.25`\n2.  Calculate the moments:\n    *   `<a^2> = 0.25`\n    *   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`\n3.  Evaluate `<n>`:\n    *   `coth(0.25) = (e^0.5 + 1) / (e^0.5 - 1) ≈ 4.0829`\n    *   `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.0829 ≈ 1.0207`\n4.  Calculate `nu^2`:\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.0207 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.5207)^2 - 0.0625`\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ 2.3125 - 0.0625 = 2.25`\n\n**Careful Point 3: Exact Intermediate Result**\nThe problem parameters are deliberately chosen so that the calculation yields an exact, simple number.\n*   `nu^2 = 2.25`\n*   `nu = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`\n\n5.  Calculate the final entropy `S(tau)`:\n    *   `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n    *   Since `ln(1) = 0`, the expression simplifies to `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2)`.\n6.  Final Value:\n    *   `nG = 2 * ln(2) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated value for the non-Gaussianity is approximately **1.386**. We compare this result to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 2.48\nC) 1.38\nD) 0.25\n\nThe calculated value `1.386` is best represented by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers and the problem statement, here is a step-by-step derivation of the final answer, highlighting the most important points.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Simplification of the Non-Gaussianity (nG) Measure**\n\nThe non-Gaussianity is defined as the relative entropy between the state of interest, `rho`, and a reference Gaussian state, `tau`:\n`del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho)) - trace(tau* ln(tau))]`\n\nThis can be rewritten using the von Neumann entropy, `S(σ) = -trace(σ ln σ)`, as:\n`nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Entropy of a Pure State.** The state `|psi>` is a pure quantum state. The von Neumann entropy, `S(rho)`, of any pure state is always zero. This is a fundamental concept that provides the first major simplification.\n\nTherefore, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state:\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n**2. Determining the Properties of the Reference Gaussian State (τ)**\n\nThe reference state `tau` is defined as the Gaussian state that has the same first and second statistical moments as the state `rho`.\n\n*   **State Identification:** With the given parameters `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`, the state `|psi>` becomes proportional to `(|alpha> - |-alpha>)`.

This implies that the reference state `tau` is a **squeezed thermal state**, not a simple thermal state (for which `<a^2>` would be zero).\n\n**3. Calculating the Entropy of the Reference State S(τ)**\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is a function of its symplectic eigenvalue, `ν`.\n\n*   **Entropy Formula:** `S(tau) = (ν + 1/2) * ln(ν + 1/2) - (ν - 1/2) * ln(ν - 1/2)`\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Symplectic Eigenvalue Calculation.** The symplectic eigenvalue `ν` is calculated from the second moments using the formula for a centered Gaussian state:\n    `ν^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`\n\n**4. Performing the Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe substitute the given parameter `alpha = 0.5`:\n1.  `alpha^2 = 0.25`\n2.  The second moments are:\n    *   `<a^2> = 0.25`\n    *   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`\n3.  We calculate the value of `<n>`:\n    *   `coth(0.25) = (e^0.5 + 1) / (e^0.5 - 1) ≈ 4.0829`\n    *   `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.0829 ≈ 1.0207`\n4.  Now, we calculate `ν^2`:\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.0207 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.5207)^2 - 0.0625`\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ 2.3125 - 0.0625 = 2.25`\n    The fact that this result is exactly 2.25 indicates the problem parameters were chosen for a clean solution.\n5.  Calculate `ν`:\n    *   `ν = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`\n6.  Finally, calculate the entropy `S(tau)` with `ν = 1.5`:\n    *   `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n7.  Since `ln(1) = 0`, the final expression is:\n    *   `nG = S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`\n\n**5.

A fundamental principle is that the von Neumann entropy of any pure state is zero. Therefore, `S(rho) = 0`.\n    The calculation simplifies to finding the entropy of the reference Gaussian state:\n    `nG = S(tau)`\n\n2.  **Characterize the State and its Moments:**\n    The given parameters are `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`. For this phase, the state `|psi>` becomes an \"odd\" Schrödinger cat state, which is proportional to `(|alpha> - |-alpha>)`. The reference Gaussian state `tau` must have the same first and second statistical moments as this state.\n    *   **First Moment (Displacement):** Due to the symmetry of the odd cat state, its mean displacement `<a>` is zero. This means `tau` is a centered Gaussian state.\n    *   **Second Moments (Covariance):** A centered Gaussian state is defined by its mean photon number `<n> = <a†a>` and its squeezing term `<a^2>`. For the odd cat state, the standard formulas for these moments are:\n        *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n        *   `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Entropy of the Reference State `S(tau)`:**\n    The entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by its symplectic eigenvalue, `nu`. The formula for the entropy is:\n    `S(tau) = (nu + 1/2) * ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2) * ln(nu - 1/2)`\n    The symplectic eigenvalue `nu` is calculated from the second moments using the formula:\n    `nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`\n\n4.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\n    We substitute the parameter `alpha = 0.5`, which gives `alpha^2 = 0.25`.\n    *   `<a^2> = 0.25`\n    *   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`\n    First, we evaluate `coth(0.25)`:\n    `coth(0.25) = (e^0.5 + 1) / (e^0.5 - 1) ≈ 4.0829`\n    Now, we find `<n>`:\n    `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.0829 ≈ 1.0207`\n    Next, we calculate `nu^2`:\n    `nu^2 ≈ (1.0207 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    `nu^2 ≈ (1.5207)^2 - 0.0625`\n    `nu^2 ≈ 2.3125 - 0.0625 = 2.25`\n    The calculation yields `nu^2` to be exactly 2.25, which means the symplectic eigenvalue is:\n    `nu = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`\n    Finally, we substitute `nu = 1.5` into the entropy formula:\n    `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n    Since `ln(1) = 0`, the expression simplifies to:\n    `nG = S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`\n\n### Careful Points in the Analysis\n\n*   **Purity of the State:** The most crucial simplification is recognizing that `S(rho) = 0` because the Schrödinger cat state is a pure state.\n*   **Nature of the Reference State:** It is essential to correctly identify the reference state `tau`. Since `<a^2> = alpha^2` is non-zero, `tau` is a *squeezed thermal state*, not a simple thermal state. An incorrect assumption here would lead to a wrong result.\n*   **Correct Formulas:** Using the correct formulas for the moments (`<a^2>` and `<n>`) and the symplectic eigenvalue (`nu`) is critical for the calculation.\n*   **Exactness of the Result:** The parameters `alpha = 0.5` and `phi = -pi/4` are specifically chosen to yield an exact intermediate result of `nu = 1.5`, leading to the clean final expression `nG = 2 * ln(2)`. This serves as a good check on the calculation.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculated value for the non-Gaussianity is approximately **1.386**.
