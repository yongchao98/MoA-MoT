Using classical mechanics would lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **Symmetry and Momentum:** The assumption of equal energy distribution among the four final particles is a direct and necessary consequence of applying the conservation of momentum to a symmetric final state that originates from a zero-momentum initial state.\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** All 15 candidate answers that show their work arrive at the same numerical result of approximately 0.77c. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to the fact that the options were presented in a different order to each agent.

Since the resulting particles will have high kinetic energy, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The phrase \"slowly moving\" implies their initial kinetic energy is negligible. Therefore, the total initial energy is the sum of their rest energies.

An antiproton has the same mass.\n    $E_{initial} = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Distribute Energy to Final Particles:** The final state has four particles ($2A^+ + 2A^-$), all with the same rest energy $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. Since the initial momentum was zero, the final total momentum must also be zero. By symmetry, the initial energy is distributed equally among the four identical final particles.\n    Energy per particle A: $E_A = \\frac{E_{initial}}{4} = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Velocity using Relativistic Formulas:** The total energy of a relativistic particle is $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   First, we find the Lorentz factor:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$.\n    *   Next, we solve for the velocity ($v$) from the Lorentz factor's definition, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. Let $\\beta = v/c$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911}$.\n    *   This gives $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated velocity is approximately **0.77c**.

This process is governed by the fundamental laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Because the energy released is substantial and the resulting particles will move at high speeds, the framework of special relativity must be used.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State and Calculate Initial Energy**\n    *   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" This is a standard simplification in physics problems, indicating that the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible compared to its rest energy. This allows us to analyze the event in the center-of-mass frame where the particles are effectively at rest.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is therefore the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.

This simplifies the initial energy calculation to only the rest energies and sets the initial momentum to zero.\n*   **Relativistic Kinematics:** The kinetic energy of each final particle ($E_k = E_A - m_A c^2 \\approx 169$ MeV) is a significant fraction of its rest energy (300 MeV), confirming that a relativistic calculation is mandatory. Classical mechanics would yield an incorrect result.\n*   **Symmetry and Conservation:** The assumption of equal energy distribution among the four final particles is a direct and necessary consequence of applying the conservation of momentum to a symmetric final state that originates from a zero-momentum initial state.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** All provided candidate answers that show their work arrive at the same numerical result of approximately 0.77c.

Using the value of approximately 938.3 MeV:\n        $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 \\approx 2 \\times 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State and Distribute Energy**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   All four particles have the same rest energy, given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   According to the law of conservation of momentum, since the initial momentum was zero, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero.\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the final state (four particles of identical mass), the total energy released will be distributed equally among them. Each particle will have the same total energy, $E_A$.\n    *   The energy per particle A is:\n        $E_A = \\frac{E_{initial}}{4} = \\frac{1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Velocity of Particle A**\n    *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by the formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   We can calculate the Lorentz factor for particle A:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\, \\text{MeV}}{300 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the velocity, $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substituting the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n    *   $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.769c$. This value rounds to **0.77c**. Comparing this result with the given options:\n    *   A) 0.86c\n    *   B) 0.91c\n    *   C) 0.77c\n    *   D) 0.96c\n\n    The calculated velocity matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **\"Slowly moving\" Approximation:** It is critical to interpret this phrase as \"negligible initial kinetic energy.\" This simplifies the initial energy calculation to only the rest energies and sets the initial momentum to zero.\n*   **Relativistic Kinematics:** The kinetic energy of each final particle ($E_k = E_A - m_A c^2 \\approx 169$ MeV) is a significant fraction of its rest energy (300 MeV), confirming that relativistic formulas are mandatory.\n*   **Symmetry and Conservation:** The assumption of equal energy distribution among the four final particles is a direct and necessary consequence of applying momentum conservation to a symmetric final state originating from a zero-momentum initial state.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** There is a strong consensus among all 15 candidate answers on the calculation method and the numerical result of approximately 0.77c. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to inconsistent ordering of the options they were presented with, not errors in the physics calculation. The calculation itself is robust and consistently yields the same value.\n\nThe final decision is based on performing the correct physical calculation and matching the result to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",
