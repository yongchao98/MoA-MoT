A DoU of 5 strongly suggests a benzene ring (4 DoU) and one additional double bond (1 DoU), which is likely a carbonyl group given the NMR data.\n    *   **¹H-NMR Data:**\n        *   `9.72 (t, 1H)`: This is a classic aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet splitting means it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group.\n        *   `3.66 (d, 2H)`: This is the -CH₂- group adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet splitting confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton. This confirms a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n        *   `6.98 (d, 2H)` and `6.51 (d, 2H)`: This pattern of two doublets is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   `6.27 (bs, 2H)`: A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Assembling these fragments gives the starting material: **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence:**\n    *   **Reagents 1 & 2 (NaNO₂ + HCl, then H₂O):** This is a standard two-step procedure to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol. The -NH₂ group is first converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), which is then hydrolyzed by water to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   **Reagent 3 (aq. KOH, Heat):** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The reactant, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group), making it a perfect substrate.\n\n3.  **Determine the Final Product:**\n    *   The aldol reaction proceeds in two stages. First, an **aldol addition** occurs, where two molecules of the aldehyde combine to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde. In this case, that product would be `3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal`.\n    *   However, the reaction conditions explicitly include **\"Heat\"**. Heat promotes a dehydration reaction (the \"condensation\" step), where a molecule of water is eliminated from the aldol addition product. This forms a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   The final product after dehydration is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n4.  **Match the Final Product to the Options:**\n    *   The derived final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n    *   Let's compare this to the provided options:\n        *   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect structure (missing -OH groups, wrong double bond position).\n        *   B) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** - **This is the correct match.**\n        *   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure (not a condensation product).\n        *   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol *addition* product, not the final product under heat.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Correct Identification of Starting Material:** The analysis of the NMR data is the foundation. Misinterpreting any signal would lead to an incorrect starting point.\n2.  **Recognition of the Reaction Sequence:** It is essential to recognize the three distinct reactions: diazotization, hydrolysis, and aldol condensation.\n3.  **Addition vs. Condensation:** The most critical detail is the presence of **\"Heat\"**. This explicitly signals that the reaction does not stop at the aldol addition product (the β-hydroxy aldehyde, Option D) but proceeds to the more stable, dehydrated aldol condensation product (the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, Option B).\n4.  **Matching Name to Structure:** After determining the correct chemical structure, it must be carefully matched to the name provided in the options. As seen in the candidate answers, many agents correctly deduced the final product's structure but failed to map it to the correct letter choice from the original question, often because they reordered the options in their own analysis.\n\nThe chemical reasoning is consistent across the provided answers and leads to one conclusion. The final product is the result of a full aldol condensation, which includes dehydration.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Starting Material**\n\nThe first step is to deduce the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C₈H₉NO from the provided ¹H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula C₈H₉NO has a DoU of 5, calculated as `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 5`. A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (1 degree), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a -CH₂- group).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet (d) multiplicity confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton. Together, these two signals confirm a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   **Conclusion for Starting Material:** Assembling these fragments—a para-substituted benzene ring with an amino group and an acetaldehyde group—gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** This is a standard **diazotization** reaction that converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n2.  **H₂O:** The addition of water (usually with gentle warming) **hydrolyzes** the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group), making it a perfect substrate.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Final Product**\n\nThe aldol condensation is a two-stage process. The final product depends on the reaction conditions, especially the presence of heat.\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The base (KOH) catalyzes the initial attack of an enolate from one molecule onto the carbonyl of a second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This structure corresponds to option D.\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** This is a crucial point. The reaction conditions explicitly include **\"Heat\"**. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product (the structure in option D). This dehydration is highly favorable as it forms a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\nThe final, stable product is the dehydrated structure: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n### **Step 4: Match the Final Product with the Given Options**\n\nWe must carefully compare the name of the final product with the choices provided in the question.\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect. This structure is missing the hydroxyl groups formed in step 2.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect. This is not a condensation product of two molecules.\n*   **C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** **Correct.** This is the final, stable product of the aldol condensation reaction, which includes the dehydration step driven by heat.\n*   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: Incorrect. This is the intermediate aldol addition product. It is not the final product because the reaction is heated, which causes dehydration to form product C.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers reveals a near-unanimous agreement on the chemical pathway and the structure of the final product. The discrepancies in their final letter choices stem from incorrectly mapping the correct chemical name to the provided options. The correct chemical reasoning leads to the structure named in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Starting Material**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 gives 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 5. A DoU of 5 strongly suggests a benzene ring (4 DoU) and one additional double bond (1 DoU), which is likely a carbonyl group given the NMR data.\n*   **¹H-NMR Data Interpretation:**\n    *   `9.72 ppm (t, 1H)`: This is a classic aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet splitting indicates it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group.\n    *   `3.66 ppm (d, 2H)`: This is a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet splitting confirms it is adjacent to the single aldehyde proton. Together, these two signals confirm a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   `6.98 ppm (d, 2H)` and `6.51 ppm (d, 2H)`: This pattern of two doublets is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   `6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)`: A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **Conclusion:** Assembling these fragments gives the starting material: **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n*   **Steps 1 & 2 (NaNO₂ + HCl, then H₂O):** This is a standard two-step procedure to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol. The -NH₂ group is first converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), which is then hydrolyzed by water to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product of this sequence is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n*   **Step 3 (aq. KOH, Heat):** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has both an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group), making it a perfect substrate for this reaction.\n\n**3. Determination of the Final Product**\n*   The reaction proceeds in two stages: addition followed by dehydration.\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The base (KOH) catalyzes the formation of a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This intermediate is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This structure corresponds to option D.\n*   **Aldol Condensation (Dehydration):** The key condition here is **\"Heat\"**. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product (the structure in option D). This dehydration step is highly favorable as it forms a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n*   The final product after dehydration is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**4. Careful Points and Final Decision**\n*   **Starting Material:** The correct identification of 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is the essential first step.\n*   **Reaction Recognition:** Recognizing the sequence as diazotization/hydrolysis followed by an aldol condensation is critical.\n*   **Addition vs. Condensation:** The most important detail is the presence of \"Heat\". This dictates that the final product is the result of condensation (dehydration), not just addition. Therefore, the β-hydroxy aldehyde (Option D) is an intermediate, not the final product.\n*   **Final Structure:** The final product is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, `2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal`.\n*   **Matching to Options:** Comparing the correct final product name to the provided list:\n    *   **A) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This is the correct final aldol condensation product.\n    *   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.\n    *   C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure (missing -OH groups).\n    *   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product.\n\nThe chemical reasoning is consistent across the candidate answers, but many failed to correctly map their derived product to the original list of options. The correct final product is unequivocally 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function programmatically follows the step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction\n    to determine the final product and match it to the given options.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the starting material from the provided data.\n    # Analysis of C8H9NO and NMR data points to 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n    starting_material = \"4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\"\n    print(f\"Step 1: The starting material is identified as {starting_material}.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the first two reaction steps (diazotization and hydrolysis).\n    # This sequence converts the -NH2 group to an -OH group.\n    intermediate_product = \"4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde\"\n    print(f\"Step 2: Diazotization followed by hydrolysis yields {intermediate_product}.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the final reaction step (aldol condensation).\n    # The key is the presence of \"Heat\", which drives the reaction to the dehydrated product.\n    aldol_addition_product = \"3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal\"\n    final_condensation_product = \"2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal\"\n    print(f\"Step 3: The intermediate undergoes a self-aldol reaction.\")\n    print(f\"         The initial addition product (without heat) would be: {aldol_addition_product}.\")\n    print(f\"         With heat, this dehydrates to the final condensation product: {final_condensation_product}.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Match the final product name with the given options.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal\",\n        \"B\": \"4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal\",\n        \"C\": \"2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal\",\n        \"D\": \"3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal\"\n    }\n\n    final_answer_choice = None\n    for choice, name in options.items():\n        if name == final_condensation_product:\n            final_answer_choice = choice\n            break\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Matching the final product to the provided options.\")\n    print(f\"The correct chemical name '{final_condensation_product}' corresponds to option {final_answer_choice}.\")\n    print(f\"Option D, '{options['D']}', is the intermediate before dehydration.\")\n\n    # Final Answer\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the correct final answer is {final_answer_choice}.\")\n    print(f\"<<<{final_answer_choice}>>>\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Step 1: The starting material is identified as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\nStep 2: Diazotization followed by hydrolysis yields 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\nStep 3: The intermediate undergoes a self-aldol reaction.\n         The initial addition product (without heat) would be: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal.\n         With heat, this dehydrates to the final condensation product: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\nStep 4: Matching the final product to the provided options.\nThe correct chemical name '2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal' corresponds to option A.\nOption D, '3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal', is the intermediate before dehydration.\n\nTherefore, the correct final answer is A.\n<<<A>>>\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points identified from the candidate answers.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Material**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula is C8H9NO. The DoU is calculated as `C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 5`. A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (1 degree), which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the NMR data.\n\n2.  **¹H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a -CH₂- group).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal is a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet (d) splitting confirms it is coupled to a single adjacent proton, which must be the aldehyde proton. This confirms the presence of a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on Starting Material:** Assembling these fragments—a para-substituted benzene ring, an amino group, and an ethanal group (-CH₂CHO)—leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Reagents 1 & 2 (NaNO₂ + HCl, then H₂O):** This is a standard two-step procedure to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol. The -NH₂ group is first converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺) via diazotization. The subsequent addition of water hydrolyzes the diazonium salt, replacing the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n2.  **Reagent 3 (aq. KOH, Heat):** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, possesses both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group), making it a perfect substrate for this reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Final Product and Identify Careful Points**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Aldol Addition vs. Condensation.** The reaction proceeds in two stages. The first is an aldol addition, where two molecules of the aldehyde combine to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde. In this case, that product would be **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Role of \"Heat\".** The reaction conditions explicitly include **\"Heat\"**. This is the most critical detail. Heat promotes the second stage of the reaction: dehydration (or condensation). The β-hydroxy aldehyde (Option D) is an intermediate that readily eliminates a molecule of water under these conditions to form a more stable product.\n*   **Final Product Structure:** The dehydration forms a double bond between the α and β carbons, resulting in a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the Final Product with the Given Options**\n\nLet's compare the name of our derived final product with the provided choices:\n\n*   **A) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This is the final, dehydrated aldol condensation product. This is the correct answer.\n*   **B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal:** This is incorrect. It lacks the hydroxyl groups formed in step 2 and has the double bond in the wrong position.\n*   **C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal:** This is incorrect. It is not a condensation product of two molecules.\n*   **D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal:** This is the intermediate aldol addition product. It is not the final product because the reaction is heated.\n\nThe entire reaction sequence leads to the formation of the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde due to the final heating step.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₈H₉NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2). For C₈H₉NO, this is 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 5. A DoU of 5 strongly suggests a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (1 degree), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons, which must be a -CH₂- group. This confirms a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet (d) multiplicity confirms it is coupled to a single adjacent proton, which is the aldehyde proton. This further validates the `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂). The amine is a strong electron-donating group, which is consistent with the upfield chemical shifts of the aromatic protons.\n*   **Conclusion on Starting Material:** Assembling these fragments—a para-substituted benzene ring, an amino group, and an acetaldehyde group—leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction.\n\n1.  **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO₂ + HCl, followed by H₂O:** This is a standard two-step procedure to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol. The -NH₂ group is first converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), which is then hydrolyzed by water to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n2.  **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The reactant, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic protons on the alpha-carbon (-CH₂-), making it a perfect substrate for this reaction.\n\n**3. Determination of the Final Product**\n\nThe aldol condensation is a two-stage process.\n\n*   **Stage 1: Aldol Addition:** The base (KOH) catalyzes the addition of two molecules of the aldehyde to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The structure of this initial addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option D.\n*   **Stage 2: Dehydration (Condensation):** A critical detail in the problem is the presence of **\"Heat\"**. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. This dehydration is highly favorable as it forms a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The reaction does not stop at the addition product.\n\nThe final, stable product is the dehydrated condensation product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**4. Matching the Final Product with the Given Options**\n\nWe must now carefully match the name of the final product with the provided options.\n\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect structure; it lacks the hydroxyl groups and has the wrong double bond position.\n*   **C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** - This is the correct name for the final, dehydrated aldol condensation product.\n*   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which is not the final product when heat is applied.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical reasoning is consistent: the reaction sequence produces 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. The \"Heat\" condition ensures the reaction proceeds to the final dehydrated product. The correct structure is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal, which corresponds to option C. Many of the candidate answers had correct chemical reasoning but failed in the final step of matching the product name to the correct lettered option.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and identifying key points.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Starting Material**\n\nThe initial step is to deduce the structure of the compound with the molecular formula C₈H₉NO from the given ¹H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula C₈H₉NO has a DoU of 5 (calculated as C + 1 - H/2 + N/2). This value strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond (1 degree), likely a carbonyl group.\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet splitting indicates it is adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal is a methylene group. The doublet splitting confirms it is adjacent to the single aldehyde proton. Together, these two signals confirm a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   **Conclusion:** Assembling these fragments gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** This is a **diazotization** reaction, which converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n2.  **H₂O:** The diazonium salt is then hydrolyzed by water. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has both an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group), making it a suitable substrate.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Final Product**\n\nThe aldol reaction proceeds in two stages. The final product depends on the reaction conditions.\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The base (KOH) catalyzes the initial attack of an enolate from one molecule onto the carbonyl of a second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This structure corresponds to option (C).\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction conditions explicitly include **\"Heat\"**. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the initial aldol addition product. This dehydration is favorable as it forms a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The final product is therefore the result of this condensation step.\n*   **Final Product Structure:** The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n### **Step 4: Match the Final Product with the Given Options**\n\nThe final step is to correctly match the name of the final product with the provided options.\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect. This structure lacks the required hydroxyl groups and has the double bond in the wrong position.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect. This is not a condensation product of two molecules.\n*   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: Incorrect. This is the intermediate aldol *addition* product. It is a plausible distractor but is not the final product when heat is applied.\n*   D) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** **Correct.** This is the final, stable product of the aldol *condensation* reaction, which is driven to completion by heat.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Starting Material Identification:** Correctly interpreting the NMR data to identify 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is the essential foundation.\n2.  **Reaction Recognition:** The sequence must be correctly identified as diazotization/hydrolysis followed by a self-aldol reaction.\n3.  **Addition vs. Condensation:** The most critical detail is the word **\"Heat\"**. This dictates that the reaction proceeds to the final, dehydrated condensation product, not the intermediate addition product.\n4.  **Final Product Structure:** The final product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, formed by eliminating water from the β-hydroxy aldehyde intermediate.\n\nThe unanimous chemical reasoning across all candidate answers leads to the same final structure. The discrepancies in their final letter choices arise from inconsistent mapping of the options, but the chemical conclusion is sound. Based on the options provided in the prompt, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Starting Material**\n\nThe first step is to deduce the structure of the initial compound from its molecular formula (C₈H₉NO) and ¹H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula C₈H₉NO has a DoU of 5, calculated as `C + 1 - H/2 + N/2`. This value strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (1 degree), likely a carbonyl group.\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity indicates it is coupled to an adjacent methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal is a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet multiplicity confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton. Together, these two signals confirm a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   **Conclusion:** Assembling these fragments gives the starting material: **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material undergoes a three-step reaction.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** This is a standard **diazotization** reaction, which converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n2.  **H₂O:** The addition of water (typically with gentle warming) **hydrolyzes** the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (leaving as N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has both an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons, making it a perfect substrate for this reaction.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Final Product**\n\nThe aldol condensation is a two-stage process. The final product depends on the reaction conditions.\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The base (KOH) catalyzes the initial addition of two aldehyde molecules to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This intermediate product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This structure corresponds to option (B).\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction conditions explicitly include **\"Heat\"**. This is a critical detail. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. This dehydration step is highly favorable as it forms a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\nThe final product is therefore the dehydrated structure, **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n### **Step 4: Match the Final Product with the Given Options**\n\nWe must now carefully match the name of the final product with the provided options.\n\n*   **A) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This is the correct name for the final, dehydrated aldol condensation product.\n*   **B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal:** This is the intermediate aldol *addition* product. It is not the final product because the reaction is heated.\n*   **C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal:** This is structurally incorrect; it is missing the hydroxyl groups and the double bond position is wrong.\n*   **D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal:** This is structurally incorrect; it is not a condensation product of two molecules.\n\n### **Careful Points and Conclusion**\n\n1.  **Correct Identification of Starting Material:** The analysis of the NMR data is the essential first step.\n2.  **Recognition of Reaction Sequence:** The process is a diazotization/hydrolysis followed by an aldol condensation.\n3.  **The Importance of \"Heat\":** This condition is the key to distinguishing between the aldol addition product (Option B) and the final aldol condensation product. Heat drives the reaction to the more stable, dehydrated product.\n4.  **Final Structure Identification:** The final product is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed after dehydration.\n5.  **Mapping to Options:** The chemical reasoning across the candidate answers was almost universally correct. The main source of error was incorrectly matching the final product's name to the lettered options. The correct chemical name, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal, corresponds directly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers and identifying the key decision points.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nThe first step is to determine the structure of the compound with the molecular formula C₈H₉NO from the given ¹H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula C₈H₉NO has a DoU of 5. This is calculated as `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 5`. A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (1 degree), likely a carbonyl group.\n*   **¹H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity indicates it is coupled to an adjacent methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet multiplicity confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton. Together, these two signals confirm a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   **Conclusion for Starting Material:** Assembling these fragments—a para-substituted benzene ring, an amino group, and an acetaldehyde group—leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, undergoes a three-step reaction.\n\n1.  **Reagents 1 & 2 (NaNO₂ + HCl, then H₂O):** This is a standard two-step procedure to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol. The -NH₂ group is first converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), which is then hydrolyzed by water to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n2.  **Reagent 3 (aq. KOH, Heat):** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group), making it a perfect substrate for this reaction.\n\n### **Step 3: Determination of the Final Product**\n\nThe aldol condensation is a two-stage process.\n\n1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (KOH) catalyzes the initial attack of an enolate from one molecule onto the carbonyl of a second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**.\n2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction conditions explicitly include **\"Heat\"**. This is a critical piece of information. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. This dehydration is highly favorable as it forms a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\nThe final, stable product is the dehydrated structure: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n### **Careful Points and Final Decision**\n\n*   **Addition vs. Condensation:** The most common point of error in similar problems is failing to account for the \"Heat\" condition. Heat drives the reaction past the initial aldol addition product (the β-hydroxy aldehyde) to the final, more stable aldol condensation product (the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde). Therefore, the structure in option D is an intermediate, not the final product.\n*   **Correct Structure Identification:** The final product results from the self-condensation of two molecules of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, followed by dehydration. This gives **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n*   **Matching Structure to Options:** The final step is to correctly match the name of the final product to the given options.\n    *   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect. Lacks the required hydroxyl groups and has the double bond in the wrong position.\n    *   B) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** **Correct.** This is the final, dehydrated aldol condensation product.\n    *   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect. This is not a condensation product of two molecules.\n    *   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: Incorrect. This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which is not stable under heating.\n\nThe chemical reasoning leads unequivocally to 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal as the final product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis is a multi-step synthesis problem that requires careful analysis of spectroscopic data and reaction conditions.

Its triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a -CH₂- group).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-). Its doublet (d) multiplicity confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton. Together, these two signals confirm a **-CH₂-CHO** (ethanal) fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine group (**-NH₂**).\n*   **Conclusion for Starting Material:** Assembling these fragments—a para-substituted benzene ring, an amino group, and an ethanal group—leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, undergoes a three-step reaction.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl, then 2.

The correct chemical name corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nThe first step is to determine the structure of the compound with the molecular formula C₈H₉NO using the provided ¹H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula C₈H₉NO has a DoU of 5 (calculated as C + 1 - H/2 + N/2). This high value strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (1 degree), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). Its triplet multiplicity indicates it is coupled to an adjacent methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH₂-). Its doublet multiplicity confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton. Together, these two signals confirm a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   **Conclusion:** Assembling these fragments—a para-substituted benzene ring, an amino group, and an acetaldehyde group—leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This conclusion is correctly reached by all candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, undergoes a three-step reaction.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** This is a standard **diazotization** reaction that converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n2.  **H₂O:** The addition of water **hydrolyzes** the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (departing as N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**. This intermediate is also correctly identified by all candidates.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has both an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons, making it a perfect substrate for this reaction.\n\n### **Step 3: Determination of the Final Product**\n\nThis step is the most critical and requires careful attention to the reaction conditions.\n\n*   The reaction begins with an **aldol addition**, where the enolate of one molecule attacks the carbonyl of a second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The structure of this initial product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**.\n*   However, the reaction conditions explicitly include **\"Heat\"**. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the aldol addition product. This is the \"condensation\" part of the reaction.\n*   The dehydration is highly favorable as it forms a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The final product is therefore **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n### **Step 4: Matching the Final Product with the Given Options**\n\nThe final step is to correctly match the name of the final product with the provided options.\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect. This structure is missing the hydroxyl groups formed in step 2.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: Incorrect. This is the intermediate aldol *addition* product. It is not the final product because the reaction is heated, which drives the dehydration.\n*   C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** **Correct.** This is the final, stable product of the aldol *condensation* reaction, which includes the dehydration step promoted by heat.\n*   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect. This is not a condensation product of two molecules.\n\n### **Careful Points and Conclusion**\n\n*   **Addition vs. Condensation:** The most common pitfall in this type of problem is failing to account for the \"Heat\" condition. Heat ensures the reaction proceeds to the final, dehydrated condensation product, not the initial addition product.\n*   **Consistency of Reasoning:** All 15 candidate answers demonstrate correct chemical reasoning. They all correctly identify the starting material, the intermediate from the first two steps, and the final chemical structure resulting from the aldol condensation.\n*   **Mapping Error:** The primary source of discrepancy among the candidate answers is not in the chemical analysis but in incorrectly mapping the final product's name to the lettered options (A, B, C, D). Several candidates had the correct chemical name but assigned it to the wrong letter.\n\nBased on a rigorous and careful analysis of the chemistry and the provided options, the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nThe first step is to determine the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C₈H₉NO from the given ¹H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for the degree of unsaturation is C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2). For C₈H₉NO, this is 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 5. A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond (1 degree), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **¹H-NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons, suggesting a -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH₂-). Its doublet (d) multiplicity confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton, validating the -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   **Conclusion on Starting Material:** Assembling these fragments—a para-substituted benzene ring, an amino group, and an acetaldehyde group—leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, undergoes a three-step reaction.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl, then H₂O:** This is a standard two-step procedure to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol. The first reagent performs a **diazotization**, converting the -NH₂ group into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The subsequent addition of water **hydrolyzes** this salt, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n2.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group), making it a perfect substrate for this reaction.\n\n### **Step 3: Determination of the Final Product**\n\nThe aldol condensation is a two-stage process. The conditions specified are crucial for determining the final product.\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The base (KOH) first catalyzes an aldol addition, where two molecules of the aldehyde combine to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The structure of this initial product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This structure corresponds to option D.\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction conditions explicitly include **\"Heat\"**. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the aldol addition product. This step is highly favorable as it forms a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The reaction does not stop at the intermediate stage (Option D).\n\nThe final product after dehydration is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n### **Step 4: Matching the Final Product with the Given Options**\n\nWe must now match the name of the final product with the provided options.\n\n*   **A) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This is the final, dehydrated aldol condensation product. This is the correct structure.\n*   **B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal:** This is structurally incorrect and not a condensation product.\n*   **C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal:** This is incorrect as it lacks the hydroxyl groups formed in the second step.\n*   **D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal:** This is the intermediate aldol *addition* product. It is not the final product because the reaction is heated.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   The analysis of the NMR data to correctly identify the starting material is the essential first step.\n*   Recognizing the reaction sequence as diazotization/hydrolysis followed by an aldol condensation is critical.\n*   The most important point is understanding the role of **\"Heat\"** in the final step. It ensures the reaction proceeds to the final, more stable **condensation** product (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde) rather than stopping at the **addition** product (a β-hydroxy aldehyde).\n*   Many of the candidate answers had perfect chemical reasoning but failed in the final step of correctly matching the product name to the lettered option.\n\nThe final product of the entire reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Starting Material**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₈H₉NO.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The calculation `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2` gives `8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 5`.

The triplet splitting means it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group.\n        *   `3.66 (d, 2H)`: This is the -CH₂- group adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet splitting confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton. This confirms a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n        *   `6.98 (d, 2H)` and `6.51 (d, 2H)`: This pattern of two doublets is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   `6.27 (bs, 2H)`: A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Assembling these fragments gives the starting material: **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence:**\n    *   **Reagents 1 & 2 (NaNO₂ + HCl, then H₂O):** This is a standard two-step procedure to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol. The -NH₂ group is first converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), which is then hydrolyzed by water to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   **Reagent 3 (aq. KOH, Heat):** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The reactant, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group), making it a perfect substrate.\n\n3.  **Determine the Final Product:**\n    *   The aldol reaction proceeds in two stages. First, an **aldol addition** occurs, where two molecules of the aldehyde combine to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde. In this case, that product would be `3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal`. This corresponds to option B.\n    *   However, the reaction conditions explicitly include **\"Heat\"**. Heat promotes a dehydration reaction (the \"condensation\" step), where a molecule of water is eliminated from the aldol addition product.

All candidate answers also did this correctly.\n3.  **Addition vs. Condensation (The Role of \"Heat\"):** This is the most critical chemical decision point. The presence of **\"Heat\"** explicitly signals that the reaction does not stop at the aldol addition product (the β-hydroxy aldehyde, Option B) but proceeds to the more stable, dehydrated aldol condensation product (the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, Option A).\n4.  **Matching Name to Structure:** After determining the correct chemical structure, it must be carefully matched to the name provided in the *original* options list. The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while their chemical reasoning was sound, many failed at this final step, likely because they were working with a re-ordered list of options.\n\nThe consistent chemical reasoning across all provided answers leads to one conclusion.

A DoU of 5 strongly suggests a benzene ring (4 DoU) and one additional double bond (1 DoU), which is likely a carbonyl group given the NMR data.\n    *   **¹H-NMR Data:**\n        *   `9.72 (t, 1H)`: This is a classic aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet splitting means it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group.\n        *   `3.66 (d, 2H)`: This is the -CH₂- group adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet splitting confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton. This confirms a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n        *   `6.98 (d, 2H)` and `6.51 (d, 2H)`: This pattern of two doublets is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   `6.27 (bs, 2H)`: A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Assembling these fragments gives the starting material: **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence:**\n    *   **Reagents 1 & 2 (NaNO₂ + HCl, then H₂O):** This is a standard two-step procedure to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol. The -NH₂ group is first converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), which is then hydrolyzed by water to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   **Reagent 3 (aq. KOH, Heat):** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The reactant, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group), making it a perfect substrate.\n\n3.  **Determine the Final Product:**\n    *   The aldol reaction proceeds in two stages. First, an **aldol addition** occurs, where two molecules of the aldehyde combine to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde. In this case, that product would be `3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal`.\n    *   However, the reaction conditions explicitly include **\"Heat\"**. Heat promotes a dehydration reaction (the \"condensation\" step), where a molecule of water is eliminated from the aldol addition product. This forms a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   The final product after dehydration is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n4.  **Match the Final Product to the Options:**\n    *   The derived final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n    *   Let's compare this to the provided options:\n        *   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect structure (missing -OH groups, wrong double bond position).\n        *   B) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** - **This is the correct match.**\n        *   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure (not a condensation product).\n        *   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol *addition* product, not the final product under heat.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Correct Identification of Starting Material:** The analysis of the NMR data is the foundation. Misinterpreting any signal would lead to an incorrect starting point.\n2.  **Recognition of the Reaction Sequence:** It is essential to recognize the three distinct reactions: diazotization, hydrolysis, and aldol condensation.\n3.  **Addition vs. Condensation:** The most critical detail is the presence of **\"Heat\"**. This explicitly signals that the reaction does not stop at the aldol addition product (the β-hydroxy aldehyde, Option D) but proceeds to the more stable, dehydrated aldol condensation product (the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, Option B).\n4.  **Matching Name to Structure:** After determining the correct chemical structure, it must be carefully matched to the name provided in the options. As seen in the candidate answers, many agents correctly deduced the final product's structure but failed to map it to the correct letter choice from the original question, often because they reordered the options in their own analysis.\n\nThe chemical reasoning is consistent across the provided answers and leads to one conclusion. The final product is the result of a full aldol condensation, which includes dehydration.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Starting Material**\n\nThe first step is to deduce the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C₈H₉NO from the provided ¹H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula C₈H₉NO has a DoU of 5, calculated as `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 5`. A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (1 degree), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a -CH₂- group).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet (d) multiplicity confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton. Together, these two signals confirm a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   **Conclusion for Starting Material:** Assembling these fragments—a para-substituted benzene ring with an amino group and an acetaldehyde group—gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** This is a standard **diazotization** reaction that converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n2.  **H₂O:** The addition of water (usually with gentle warming) **hydrolyzes** the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group), making it a perfect substrate.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Final Product**\n\nThe aldol condensation is a two-stage process. The final product depends on the reaction conditions, especially the presence of heat.\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The base (KOH) catalyzes the initial attack of an enolate from one molecule onto the carbonyl of a second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This structure corresponds to option D.\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** This is a crucial point. The reaction conditions explicitly include **\"Heat\"**. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product (the structure in option D). This dehydration is highly favorable as it forms a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\nThe final, stable product is the dehydrated structure: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n### **Step 4: Match the Final Product with the Given Options**\n\nWe must carefully compare the name of the final product with the choices provided in the question.\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect. This structure is missing the hydroxyl groups formed in step 2.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect. This is not a condensation product of two molecules.\n*   **C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** **Correct.** This is the final, stable product of the aldol condensation reaction, which includes the dehydration step driven by heat.\n*   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: Incorrect. This is the intermediate aldol addition product. It is not the final product because the reaction is heated, which causes dehydration to form product C.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers reveals a near-unanimous agreement on the chemical pathway and the structure of the final product. The discrepancies in their final letter choices stem from incorrectly mapping the correct chemical name to the provided options. The correct chemical reasoning leads to the structure named in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Starting Material**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 gives 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 5. A DoU of 5 strongly suggests a benzene ring (4 DoU) and one additional double bond (1 DoU), which is likely a carbonyl group given the NMR data.\n*   **¹H-NMR Data Interpretation:**\n    *   `9.72 ppm (t, 1H)`: This is a classic aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet splitting indicates it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group.\n    *   `3.66 ppm (d, 2H)`: This is a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet splitting confirms it is adjacent to the single aldehyde proton. Together, these two signals confirm a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   `6.98 ppm (d, 2H)` and `6.51 ppm (d, 2H)`: This pattern of two doublets is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   `6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)`: A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **Conclusion:** Assembling these fragments gives the starting material: **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n*   **Steps 1 & 2 (NaNO₂ + HCl, then H₂O):** This is a standard two-step procedure to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol. The -NH₂ group is first converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), which is then hydrolyzed by water to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product of this sequence is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n*   **Step 3 (aq. KOH, Heat):** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has both an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group), making it a perfect substrate for this reaction.\n\n**3. Determination of the Final Product**\n*   The reaction proceeds in two stages: addition followed by dehydration.\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The base (KOH) catalyzes the formation of a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This intermediate is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This structure corresponds to option D.\n*   **Aldol Condensation (Dehydration):** The key condition here is **\"Heat\"**. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product (the structure in option D). This dehydration step is highly favorable as it forms a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n*   The final product after dehydration is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**4. Careful Points and Final Decision**\n*   **Starting Material:** The correct identification of 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is the essential first step.\n*   **Reaction Recognition:** Recognizing the sequence as diazotization/hydrolysis followed by an aldol condensation is critical.\n*   **Addition vs. Condensation:** The most important detail is the presence of \"Heat\". This dictates that the final product is the result of condensation (dehydration), not just addition. Therefore, the β-hydroxy aldehyde (Option D) is an intermediate, not the final product.\n*   **Final Structure:** The final product is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, `2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal`.\n*   **Matching to Options:** Comparing the correct final product name to the provided list:\n    *   **A) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This is the correct final aldol condensation product.\n    *   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.\n    *   C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure (missing -OH groups).\n    *   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product.\n\nThe chemical reasoning is consistent across the candidate answers, but many failed to correctly map their derived product to the original list of options.

This confirms the presence of a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on Starting Material:** Assembling these fragments—a para-substituted benzene ring, an amino group, and an ethanal group (-CH₂CHO)—leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Reagents 1 & 2 (NaNO₂ + HCl, then H₂O):** This is a standard two-step procedure to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol. The -NH₂ group is first converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺) via diazotization. The subsequent addition of water hydrolyzes the diazonium salt, replacing the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n2.  **Reagent 3 (aq. KOH, Heat):** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, possesses both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group), making it a perfect substrate for this reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Final Product and Identify Careful Points**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Aldol Addition vs. Condensation.** The reaction proceeds in two stages. The first is an aldol addition, where two molecules of the aldehyde combine to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde. In this case, that product would be **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Role of \"Heat\".** The reaction conditions explicitly include **\"Heat\"**. This is the most critical detail. Heat promotes the second stage of the reaction: dehydration (or condensation). The β-hydroxy aldehyde (Option D) is an intermediate that readily eliminates a molecule of water under these conditions to form a more stable product.\n*   **Final Product Structure:** The dehydration forms a double bond between the α and β carbons, resulting in a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the Final Product with the Given Options**\n\nLet's compare the name of our derived final product with the provided choices:\n\n*   **A) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This is the final, dehydrated aldol condensation product. This is the correct answer.\n*   **B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal:** This is incorrect. It lacks the hydroxyl groups formed in step 2 and has the double bond in the wrong position.\n*   **C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal:** This is incorrect. It is not a condensation product of two molecules.\n*   **D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal:** This is the intermediate aldol addition product. It is not the final product because the reaction is heated.\n\nThe entire reaction sequence leads to the formation of the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde due to the final heating step.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₈H₉NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2). For C₈H₉NO, this is 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 5. A DoU of 5 strongly suggests a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (1 degree), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons, which must be a -CH₂- group. This confirms a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet (d) multiplicity confirms it is coupled to a single adjacent proton, which is the aldehyde proton. This further validates the `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂). The amine is a strong electron-donating group, which is consistent with the upfield chemical shifts of the aromatic protons.\n*   **Conclusion on Starting Material:** Assembling these fragments—a para-substituted benzene ring, an amino group, and an acetaldehyde group—leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction.\n\n1.  **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO₂ + HCl, followed by H₂O:** This is a standard two-step procedure to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol. The -NH₂ group is first converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), which is then hydrolyzed by water to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n2.  **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The reactant, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic protons on the alpha-carbon (-CH₂-), making it a perfect substrate for this reaction.\n\n**3. Determination of the Final Product**\n\nThe aldol condensation is a two-stage process.\n\n*   **Stage 1: Aldol Addition:** The base (KOH) catalyzes the addition of two molecules of the aldehyde to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The structure of this initial addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option D.\n*   **Stage 2: Dehydration (Condensation):** A critical detail in the problem is the presence of **\"Heat\"**. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. This dehydration is highly favorable as it forms a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The reaction does not stop at the addition product.\n\nThe final, stable product is the dehydrated condensation product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**4. Matching the Final Product with the Given Options**\n\nWe must now carefully match the name of the final product with the provided options.\n\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect structure; it lacks the hydroxyl groups and has the wrong double bond position.\n*   **C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** - This is the correct name for the final, dehydrated aldol condensation product.\n*   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which is not the final product when heat is applied.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical reasoning is consistent: the reaction sequence produces 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. The \"Heat\" condition ensures the reaction proceeds to the final dehydrated product. The correct structure is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal, which corresponds to option C. Many of the candidate answers had correct chemical reasoning but failed in the final step of matching the product name to the correct lettered option.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and identifying key points.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Starting Material**\n\nThe initial step is to deduce the structure of the compound with the molecular formula C₈H₉NO from the given ¹H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula C₈H₉NO has a DoU of 5 (calculated as C + 1 - H/2 + N/2). This value strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond (1 degree), likely a carbonyl group.\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet splitting indicates it is adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal is a methylene group. The doublet splitting confirms it is adjacent to the single aldehyde proton. Together, these two signals confirm a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   **Conclusion:** Assembling these fragments gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** This is a **diazotization** reaction, which converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n2.  **H₂O:** The diazonium salt is then hydrolyzed by water. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has both an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group), making it a suitable substrate.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Final Product**\n\nThe aldol reaction proceeds in two stages. The final product depends on the reaction conditions.\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The base (KOH) catalyzes the initial attack of an enolate from one molecule onto the carbonyl of a second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This structure corresponds to option (C).\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction conditions explicitly include **\"Heat\"**. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the initial aldol addition product. This dehydration is favorable as it forms a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The final product is therefore the result of this condensation step.\n*   **Final Product Structure:** The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n### **Step 4: Match the Final Product with the Given Options**\n\nThe final step is to correctly match the name of the final product with the provided options.\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect. This structure lacks the required hydroxyl groups and has the double bond in the wrong position.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect. This is not a condensation product of two molecules.\n*   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: Incorrect. This is the intermediate aldol *addition* product. It is a plausible distractor but is not the final product when heat is applied.\n*   D) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** **Correct.** This is the final, stable product of the aldol *condensation* reaction, which is driven to completion by heat.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Starting Material Identification:** Correctly interpreting the NMR data to identify 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is the essential foundation.\n2.  **Reaction Recognition:** The sequence must be correctly identified as diazotization/hydrolysis followed by a self-aldol reaction.\n3.  **Addition vs. Condensation:** The most critical detail is the word **\"Heat\"**. This dictates that the reaction proceeds to the final, dehydrated condensation product, not the intermediate addition product.\n4.  **Final Product Structure:** The final product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, formed by eliminating water from the β-hydroxy aldehyde intermediate.\n\nThe unanimous chemical reasoning across all candidate answers leads to the same final structure. The discrepancies in their final letter choices arise from inconsistent mapping of the options, but the chemical conclusion is sound.

This is the *condensation* step.\n    *   **Final Product Structure:** The final, stable product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluation of Candidate Answers and Final Decision**\n\n*   **Consensus on Chemistry:** There is a unanimous consensus among all 15 candidate answers regarding the chemical pathway. They all correctly identify the starting material, the intermediate, and the final product's chemical structure as **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. They all correctly recognize that the \"Heat\" condition leads to the dehydrated condensation product.\n\n*   **Source of Discrepancy:** The variation in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the candidates is due to a simple but critical error: they do not consistently use the option list provided in the original question. Many of them create their own, differently ordered list of options in their reasoning.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:** The chemical reasoning is sound and universally points to one structure. The task is to match this correct structure to the original list of options.\n\n    *   **Final Product Name:** **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**\n    *   **Original Options List:**\n        *   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (The intermediate addition product)\n        *   B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal (Incorrect structure)\n        *   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal (Incorrect structure)\n        *   D) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** (The correct final condensation product)\n\nThe correct final product name matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nThe first step is to determine the structure of the compound with the molecular formula C₈H₉NO using the provided ¹H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2. For C₈H₉NO, this is 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 5. A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (1 degree), which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the NMR data.\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons, suggesting a -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet (d) multiplicity confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton, validating the -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   **Conclusion on Starting Material:** Assembling these fragments—a para-substituted benzene ring, an amino group, and an ethanal group (-CH₂CHO)—leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, undergoes a three-step reaction.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl, then H₂O:** This is a standard two-step procedure to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol. The -NH₂ group is first converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), which is then hydrolyzed by water to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n2.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The reactant, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic protons on the alpha-carbon (-CH₂-), making it a perfect substrate for this reaction.\n\n### **Step 3: Determination of the Final Product**\n\nThe aldol condensation is a two-part process: an initial addition followed by dehydration.\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The base (KOH) catalyzes the attack of an enolate from one molecule onto the carbonyl of a second molecule. This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The structure of this intermediate is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**.\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** A critical point, noted by all the successful reasoning paths, is the presence of **\"Heat\"** in the reaction conditions. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. This dehydration is highly favorable as it forms a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\nThe final, stable product is the dehydrated condensation product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n### **Step 4: Matching the Final Product with the Given Options**\n\nThe final step is to match the correct chemical name with the provided options.\n\n*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol *addition* product. It is not the final product because the reaction is heated.\n*   B) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This is the final aldol *condensation* product, formed after dehydration due to heat. This is the correct answer.\n*   C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: This is structurally incorrect; it lacks the hydroxyl groups and has the double bond in the wrong position.\n*   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: This is structurally incorrect; it is not a condensation product of two molecules.\n\nThe chemical reasoning is consistent across all candidate answers and leads to the same final structure. The discrepancies in the candidate answers' final letter choices are due to inconsistent labeling of the options in their individual analyses. Based on the options provided in the question, the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final product.\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₈H₉NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2. For C₈H₉NO, this is 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 5. A DoU of 5 strongly suggests a benzene ring (4 DoU) and one additional double bond (1 DoU), most likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the NMR data.\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a -CH₂- group), confirming a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal is a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet (d) multiplicity confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton, further validating the `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   **Conclusion on Starting Material:** Assembling these fragments gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This structure is consistent with both the molecular formula and all NMR data.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl, then H₂O:** This is a standard two-step procedure to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol. The -NH₂ group is first converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), which is then hydrolyzed by water to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n2.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group), making it a perfect substrate.\n\n**3. Determination of the Final Product**\n\nThe aldol condensation proceeds in two stages: addition followed by dehydration.\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The base (KOH) catalyzes the attack of an enolate from one molecule onto the carbonyl of a second molecule. This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This structure corresponds to **Option D**.\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The key detail is the presence of **\"Heat\"**. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product (Option D). This dehydration is highly favorable as it forms a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The reaction does not stop at the addition stage.\n\nThe final, stable product after dehydration is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**4. Matching the Final Product with the Given Options**\n\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure; lacks the hydroxyl groups.\n*   C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This is the correct name for the final, dehydrated aldol condensation product.\n*   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol *addition* product, which is not the final product when heat is applied.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The correct identification of 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde from the spectral data is the essential first step.\n2.  **Reaction Sequence:** Recognizing the diazotization/hydrolysis followed by an aldol condensation is crucial.\n3.  **Addition vs. Condensation:** The most important detail is the \"Heat\" condition, which dictates that the final product is the result of condensation (dehydration), not just addition.\n4.  **Final Structure:** The final product is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n5.  **Mapping to Options:** The final derived product name must be carefully matched to the provided list. The correct chemical name corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nThe first step is to determine the structure of the compound with the molecular formula C₈H₉NO using the provided ¹H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula C₈H₉NO has a DoU of 5 (calculated as C + 1 - H/2 + N/2). This high value strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (1 degree), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). Its triplet multiplicity indicates it is coupled to an adjacent methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH₂-). Its doublet multiplicity confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton. Together, these two signals confirm a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   **Conclusion:** Assembling these fragments—a para-substituted benzene ring, an amino group, and an acetaldehyde group—leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This conclusion is correctly reached by all candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, undergoes a three-step reaction.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** This is a standard **diazotization** reaction that converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n2.  **H₂O:** The addition of water **hydrolyzes** the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (departing as N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**. This intermediate is also correctly identified by all candidates.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has both an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons, making it a perfect substrate for this reaction.\n\n### **Step 3: Determination of the Final Product**\n\nThis step is the most critical and requires careful attention to the reaction conditions.\n\n*   The reaction begins with an **aldol addition**, where the enolate of one molecule attacks the carbonyl of a second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The structure of this initial product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**.\n*   However, the reaction conditions explicitly include **\"Heat\"**. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the aldol addition product. This is the \"condensation\" part of the reaction.\n*   The dehydration is highly favorable as it forms a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The final product is therefore **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n### **Step 4: Matching the Final Product with the Given Options**\n\nThe final step is to correctly match the name of the final product with the provided options.\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect. This structure is missing the hydroxyl groups formed in step 2.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: Incorrect. This is the intermediate aldol *addition* product. It is not the final product because the reaction is heated, which drives the dehydration.\n*   C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** **Correct.** This is the final, stable product of the aldol *condensation* reaction, which includes the dehydration step promoted by heat.\n*   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect. This is not a condensation product of two molecules.\n\n### **Careful Points and Conclusion**\n\n*   **Addition vs. Condensation:** The most common pitfall in this type of problem is failing to account for the \"Heat\" condition. Heat ensures the reaction proceeds to the final, dehydrated condensation product, not the initial addition product.\n*   **Consistency of Reasoning:** All 15 candidate answers demonstrate correct chemical reasoning. They all correctly identify the starting material, the intermediate from the first two steps, and the final chemical structure resulting from the aldol condensation.\n*   **Mapping Error:** The primary source of discrepancy among the candidate answers is not in the chemical analysis but in incorrectly mapping the final product's name to the lettered options (A, B, C, D). Several candidates had the correct chemical name but assigned it to the wrong letter.\n\nBased on a rigorous and careful analysis of the chemistry and the provided options, the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nThe first step is to determine the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C₈H₉NO from the given ¹H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for the degree of unsaturation is C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2). For C₈H₉NO, this is 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 5. A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond (1 degree), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **¹H-NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons, suggesting a -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH₂-).

The first reagent performs a **diazotization**, converting the -NH₂ group into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The subsequent addition of water **hydrolyzes** this salt, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n2.  **aq.

The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group), making it a perfect substrate for this reaction.\n\n### **Step 3: Determination of the Final Product**\n\nThe aldol condensation is a two-stage process. The conditions specified are crucial for determining the final product.\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The base (KOH) first catalyzes an aldol addition, where two molecules of the aldehyde combine to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The structure of this initial product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This structure corresponds to option D.\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction conditions explicitly include **\"Heat\"**. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the aldol addition product. This step is highly favorable as it forms a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The reaction does not stop at the intermediate stage (Option D).\n\nThe final product after dehydration is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n### **Step 4: Matching the Final Product with the Given Options**\n\nWe must now match the name of the final product with the provided options.\n\n*   **A) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This is the final, dehydrated aldol condensation product. This is the correct structure.\n*   **B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal:** This is structurally incorrect and not a condensation product.\n*   **C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal:** This is incorrect as it lacks the hydroxyl groups formed in the second step.\n*   **D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal:** This is the intermediate aldol *addition* product. It is not the final product because the reaction is heated.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   The analysis of the NMR data to correctly identify the starting material is the essential first step.\n*   Recognizing the reaction sequence as diazotization/hydrolysis followed by an aldol condensation is critical.\n*   The most important point is understanding the role of **\"Heat\"** in the final step. It ensures the reaction proceeds to the final, more stable **condensation** product (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde) rather than stopping at the **addition** product (a β-hydroxy aldehyde).\n*   Many of the candidate answers had perfect chemical reasoning but failed in the final step of correctly matching the product name to the lettered option.\n\nThe final product of the entire reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Starting Material**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₈H₉NO.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The calculation `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2` gives `8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 5`. A DoU of 5 strongly suggests a benzene ring (4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (1 degree), which is likely a carbonyl group based on the NMR data.\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at **9.72 ppm (t, 1H)** is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet splitting indicates it is adjacent to a CH₂ group.\n    *   The signal at **3.66 ppm (d, 2H)** confirms the CH₂ group is adjacent to the single aldehyde proton. This establishes a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   The two doublets at **6.98 ppm** and **6.51 ppm** are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The broad singlet at **6.27 ppm (2H)** indicates a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   **Conclusion:** Assembling these fragments (a para-substituted ring, an amine group, and an acetaldehyde group) correctly identifies the starting material as **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl, then H₂O:** This is a standard two-step procedure to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol. The amine is first converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), which is then hydrolyzed by water to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The intermediate product is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n2.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** These are the classic conditions for a self-aldol condensation. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has both an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons, allowing it to react with itself.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Final Product**\n*   The reaction is an aldol condensation. The first step is an **aldol addition**, where two molecules combine to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This intermediate would be **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**.\n*   However, the reaction conditions explicitly include **\"Heat\"**.
