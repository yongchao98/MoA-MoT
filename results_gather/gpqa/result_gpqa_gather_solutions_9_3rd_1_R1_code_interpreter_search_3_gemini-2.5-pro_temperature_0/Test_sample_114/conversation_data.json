After analyzing the provided answers, it's clear that while most agents use the correct physical formulas, there are inconsistencies in matching the final calculated value to the correct multiple-choice option. Here is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Physical Principles:** The collision involves particles at relativistic speeds (Lorentz factors > 1), so we must use the laws of conservation of relativistic energy and momentum.\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Energy:** The relativistic energy of a particle is `E = γmc²`.\n    *   Energy of the electron (`γ_e = 4`): `E_e = 4m_e c²`.\n    *   Energy of the positron (`γ_p = 2`): `E_p = 2m_e c²`.\n    *   **Total Initial Energy:** `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6m_e c²`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Initial Momentum:** The relativistic momentum is `p = √(γ² - 1)mc`. Momentum is a vector. Let's define the electron's direction of motion (from the left) as the positive x-direction.\n    *   Momentum of the electron: `p_e = √(4² - 1)m_e c = √15 m_e c`.\n    *   Momentum of the positron (moving from the right, in the negative direction): `p_p = -√(2² - 1)m_e c = -√3 m_e c`.\n    *   **Total Initial Momentum:** `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)m_e c`. This momentum is entirely along the horizontal axis.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Final State (Two Photons):**\n    *   **Energy Conservation:** The initial energy is converted into two photons of equal energy, `E_γ`.\n        `E_initial = 2E_γ` => `6m_e c² = 2E_γ` => `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n    *   **Photon Momentum:** For a photon, `E = pc`. The momentum magnitude of each photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3m_e c`.\n\n5.  **Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle:**\n    *   The initial momentum was purely horizontal. To conserve momentum, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel out. Since their momentum magnitudes are equal, they must be emitted at symmetric angles `+θ` and `-θ` relative to the horizontal axis.\n    *   The final horizontal momentum is the sum of the horizontal components of the two photon momenta: `P_final = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n    *   Equating initial and final horizontal momentum:\n        `P_initial = P_final`\n        `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2 * (3m_e c) * cos(θ)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the Angle:**\n    *   We can cancel the `m_e c` term from both sides and solve for `cos(θ)`:\n        `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n    *   Numerically:\n        `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n    *   This gives `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`.\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n        **Total Angle = 2θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°**\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Relativistic Formulas:** It is crucial to use the correct relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n*   **Vector Nature of Momentum:** The opposite directions of the initial particles must be accounted for when summing their momenta.\n*   **Final Angle:** The question asks for the total angle between the photons (`2θ`), not the angle of one photon relative to the axis (`θ`).\n*   **Matching to Options:** The calculated value of `138.2°` is closest to the option **138**. In the original question, this corresponds to option D. Several candidate answers correctly calculate the value but then select the wrong letter.\n\nThe correct calculation consistently yields a result of approximately 138 degrees.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points needed to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### **1. Identify the Governing Physical Principles**\nThe problem involves the annihilation of an electron and a positron moving at relativistic speeds. Therefore, the solution must be derived from the laws of **conservation of energy** and **conservation of momentum** as formulated in Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Initial State of the System (Before Collision)**\nWe must first determine the total energy and total momentum of the electron-positron pair. Let `m_e` be the rest mass of the electron (and positron) and `c` be the speed of light.\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The energy of a particle is given by `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The momentum `p` is given by `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`.\n\nLet's define the horizontal axis as the x-axis, with the electron's motion from left to right being the positive direction.\n\n*   **Electron (e⁻):**\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`.\n    *   Energy: `E_e = 4m_e c²`.\n    *   Momentum: `p_e = m_e c√(4² - 1) = m_e c√15` (in the +x direction).\n\n*   **Positron (e⁺):**\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`.\n    *   Energy: `E_p = 2m_e c²`.\n    *   Momentum: `p_p = m_e c√(2² - 1) = m_e c√3` (in the -x direction).\n\n*   **Total Initial System:**\n    *   **Total Energy (`E_initial`):** Energy is a scalar, so we add the individual energies.\n        `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6m_e c²`.\n    *   **Total Momentum (`P_initial`):** Momentum is a vector. We must account for the opposite directions of motion.\n        `P_initial = p_e - p_p = (√15 - √3)m_e c`. This net momentum is in the positive x-direction.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Final State of the System (After Annihilation)**\nThe initial particles annihilate, creating two photons.\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The total initial energy is converted into the energy of the two photons. The problem states they have equal energy, `E_γ`.\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `6m_e c² = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`\n    This gives the energy of each photon: `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n\n*   **Photon Momentum:** For a photon, the relationship between energy and momentum is `E = pc`.\n    The magnitude of each photon's momentum is `p_γ = E_γ / c = (3m_e c²) / c = 3m_e c`.\n\n### **4. Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle**\nThe total momentum of the system must be conserved.\n\n*   **Vertical Momentum (y-direction):** The initial momentum in the vertical direction was zero. For the final vertical momentum to also be zero, the vertical components of the two photons' momenta must cancel each other out. Since the photons have equal momentum magnitudes, they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis. Let this angle be `θ`.\n\n*   **Horizontal Momentum (x-direction):** The initial horizontal momentum must equal the final horizontal momentum. The final horizontal momentum is the sum of the horizontal components of the two photons' momenta.\n    `P_final_x = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n\n*   Equating the initial and final horizontal momentum:\n    `P_initial = P_final_x`\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2p_γ cos(θ)`\n\n### **5. Solve for the Angle**\nNow we substitute the value of `p_γ = 3m_e c` into the momentum conservation equation:\n`(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2(3m_e c)cos(θ)`\n\nWe can cancel the `m_e c` term from both sides:\n`√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`\n\nSolving for `cos(θ)`:\n`cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n*   `√15 ≈ 3.873`\n*   `√3 ≈ 1.732`\n*   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n\nThis gives the angle `θ` for one photon relative to the horizontal axis:\n`θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n\n### **6. Determine the Final Answer**\nA crucial point is to answer the specific question asked: \"What is the angle **between** the directions of the photons?\". Since one photon travels at an angle of `+θ` to the horizontal and the other at `-θ`, the total angle between them is `2θ`.\n\nTotal Angle = `2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°`.\n\nThis calculated value is closest to the option **138**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nOf course.

I will use energy conservation to find the energy of each photon.\n4.  **Apply Momentum Conservation:** I will equate the initial net momentum to the final momentum of the two-photon system. The final momentum will be expressed in terms of the angle between the photons.

Its energy is `E_e = 4m_e c²`.\n*   **Positron (e⁺):** It has a Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`.

Calculate the Total Initial Momentum**\n\nThe relativistic momentum `p` can be found using the energy-momentum relation `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, which can be rearranged to `p = m c * sqrt(γ² - 1)`.

Therefore, the principles of special relativity must be used. The classical formulas for energy and momentum are not applicable.\n2.  **Vector Nature of Momentum:** Momentum is a vector quantity. The electron and positron are moving in opposite directions, so their momenta must be treated with opposite signs when calculating the total initial momentum of the system.\n3.  **Conservation Laws:** The two fundamental principles governing the interaction are the conservation of total energy and the conservation of total momentum. The total energy and momentum of the system before the annihilation must equal the total energy and momentum of the two photons after.\n4.  **Symmetry of the Final State:** The initial momentum is entirely along the horizontal axis (the vertical component is zero). To conserve momentum, the total vertical momentum of the two photons must also be zero. Since the photons have equal energy (and therefore equal momentum magnitude), they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles relative to the horizontal axis.\n5.  **Distinction Between `θ` and `2θ`:** The angle `θ` derived from the momentum conservation equations represents the angle of *each* photon relative to the horizontal axis.

Identify Physical Principles:**\nThe collision involves particles at relativistic speeds (indicated by Lorentz factors `γ > 1`), so we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum. The core principles are:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the annihilation equals the total energy after.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum vector of the system is conserved.\n\n**2. Calculate Initial State (Before Annihilation)**\nLet `m_e` be the rest mass of the electron (and positron) and `c` be the speed of light. We define the direction of the electron's motion (from left to right) as the positive x-direction.\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy (`E_initial`):**\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle is `E = γmc²`.\n    *   Energy of electron (`γ_e = 4`): `E_e = 4m_e c²`.\n    *   Energy of positron (`γ_p = 2`): `E_p = 2m_e c²`.\n    *   `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6m_e c²`.\n\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (`P_initial`):**\n    *   The relativistic momentum is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Momentum is a vector.\n    *   Momentum of electron: `p_e = m_e c√(4² - 1) = m_e c√15` (in the +x direction).\n    *   Momentum of positron: `p_p = m_e c√(2² - 1) = m_e c√3` (in the -x direction).\n    *   The total initial momentum is the vector sum, which is purely along the x-axis:\n        `P_initial = p_e - p_p = (√15 - √3)m_e c`.\n\n**3. Analyze Final State (After Annihilation)**\nThe final state consists of two photons.\n\n*   **Energy of Photons:**\n    *   By energy conservation, `E_initial` is converted into the energy of the two photons. The problem states they have equal energy, `E_γ`.\n    *   `6m_e c² = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n    *   Therefore, the energy of each photon is `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n\n*   **Momentum of Photons:**\n    *   For a photon, energy and momentum are related by `E = pc`.\n    *   The magnitude of each photon's momentum is `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3m_e c`.\n\n**4. Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle**\nThis is the most critical step.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Vector Conservation.** The initial momentum is non-zero and points entirely in the +x direction. Therefore, the total final momentum must also be equal to this value.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Symmetry.** Since the initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction is zero, the final y-momentum must also be zero. As the two photons have equal momentum magnitudes, their y-components must cancel. This means they are emitted at symmetric angles `+θ` and `-θ` relative to the horizontal axis.\n*   **Setting up the equation:** The final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of the two photon momenta:\n    `P_final_x = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n*   Equating initial and final horizontal momentum:\n    `P_initial = P_final_x`\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n*   Substitute `p_γ = 3m_e c`:\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2(3m_e c)cos(θ)`.\n*   Simplify by canceling `m_e c`:\n    `√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`.\n*   Solve for `cos(θ)`:\n    `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`.\n\n**5. Numerical Calculation**\n*   `√15 ≈ 3.8730`\n*   `√3 ≈ 1.7321`\n*   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.8730 - 1.7321) / 6 = 2.1409 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n*   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Final Angle.** The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons. This is the sum of the angle of the first photon above the axis (`θ`) and the second below the axis (`θ`).\n    *   Total Angle = `2θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°`.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\nThe calculated angle is approximately 138.2°. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 74\nB) 172\nC) 96\nD) 138\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers and an independent verification of the physics, the correct solution can be determined by carefully applying the principles of special relativity.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nThe core of this problem is the application of two fundamental conservation laws in the context of special relativity:\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Total Initial Energy**\nThe relativistic energy of a particle is given by the formula `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Electron's Energy (E_e):** With a Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`, its energy is `E_e = 4m_e c²`.\n*   **Positron's Energy (E_p):** With a Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`, its energy is `E_p = 2m_e c²`.\n*   **Total Initial Energy (E_initial):** The total energy before the collision is the sum of the individual energies:\n    `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6m_e c²`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Initial Momentum**\nThe relativistic momentum `p` is given by `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Momentum is a vector quantity. Let's define the direction of the electron's motion (from left to right) as the positive x-direction.\n\n*   **Electron's Momentum (p_e):** `p_e = m_e c * √(4² - 1) = m_e c * √15`.\n*   **Positron's Momentum (p_p):** It moves in the opposite direction, so its momentum is negative. `p_p = -m_e c * √(2² - 1) = -m_e c * √3`.\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (P_initial):** The total momentum is the vector sum, which in this one-dimensional case is the algebraic sum:\n    `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)m_e c`.\n    The initial momentum in the vertical direction is zero.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Final State (Two Photons)**\nAfter annihilation, the total energy and momentum are carried by two photons.\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The total initial energy is divided equally between the two photons, as stated in the problem. Let the energy of each photon be `E_γ`.\n    `E_initial = 2E_γ` => `6m_e c² = 2E_γ` => `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n*   **Photon Momentum:** The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`. Therefore, the magnitude of each photon's momentum is `p_γ = 3m_e c`.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle**\nThe total momentum of the system must be conserved.\n*   Since the initial vertical momentum was zero, the final vertical momentum must also be zero. As the two photons have equal momentum magnitude, they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis. Let this angle be `θ`.\n*   The final horizontal momentum is the sum of the horizontal components of each photon's momentum: `P_final = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n*   Equating the initial and final horizontal momentum:\n    `P_initial = P_final`\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2p_γ cos(θ)`\n*   Substitute the value `p_γ = 3m_e c`:\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2(3m_e c)cos(θ)`\n    `(√15 - √3) = 6cos(θ)`\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the Angle**\nWe can now solve for `θ`.\n*   `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n*   Using the approximate values `√15 ≈ 3.873` and `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n    `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n*   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n*   **Total Angle = 2θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°**\n\nThis value is closest to 138.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Relativistic Formulas:** The Lorentz factors are significantly greater than 1, so using classical formulas for energy (`1/2 mv²`) and momentum (`mv`) would give an incorrect result. Relativistic formulas `E = γmc²` and `p = mc√(γ² - 1)` are essential.\n2.  **Momentum as a Vector:** Momentum is a vector. The total initial momentum is the vector sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. Since they move in opposite directions, their momenta are subtracted.\n3.  **Conservation of Momentum Components:** The conservation of momentum applies to each spatial component independently. The fact that the initial vertical momentum is zero is a key constraint on the final state, forcing the photons to be emitted at symmetric angles.\n4.  **Angle Definition:** The calculation yields `θ`, which is the angle of each photon relative to the central axis. The question asks for the total angle *between* the photons, which is `2θ`.\n5.  **Mapping to Options:** The calculated value of ~138.2° must be correctly matched to the given options. In this case, 138 is option B. Many of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed at this final mapping step.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers and the underlying physics, here is a step-by-step solution with careful points highlighted.\n\nThe physical principles and mathematical steps are overwhelmingly consistent across all candidate answers. The main source of error in the provided answers is incorrectly mapping the final calculated value to the given multiple-choice options. The physics itself is sound.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Governing Principles:** The problem involves particles moving at high speeds (indicated by Lorentz factors greater than 1) and an annihilation event. Therefore, the solution must be based on the principles of **conservation of energy** and **conservation of momentum** from the theory of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial State (Before Collision):** We first calculate the total energy and total momentum of the electron-positron system. Let `m_e` be the rest mass of the electron (and positron) and `c` be the speed of light.\n    *   **Electron (e⁻):** Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`. It moves from the left, which we define as the positive (+) x-direction.\n        *   Energy: `E_e = γ_e * m_e * c² = 4m_e c²`\n        *   Momentum: `p_e = m_e * c * sqrt(γ_e² - 1) = m_e * c * sqrt(4² - 1) = sqrt(15) m_e c`\n    *   **Positron (e⁺):** Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`. It moves from the right, which is the negative (-) x-direction.\n        *   Energy: `E_p = γ_p * m_e * c² = 2m_e c²`\n        *   Momentum: `p_p = -m_e * c * sqrt(γ_p² - 1) = -m_e * c * sqrt(2² - 1) = -sqrt(3) m_e c`\n    *   **Total Initial System:**\n        *   Total Energy: `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6m_e c²`\n        *   Total Momentum: `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c` (This is a vector sum, entirely along the x-axis).\n\n3.  **Analyze Final State (After Annihilation):** The system becomes two photons.\n    *   **Energy Conservation:** The total initial energy is divided equally between the two photons.\n        *   `E_final = E_initial` => `2 * E_photon = 6m_e c²`\n        *   Energy per photon: `E_photon = 3m_e c²`\n    *   **Photon Momentum:** The momentum of a photon is `p = E/c`.\n        *   Momentum per photon: `p_photon = E_photon / c = 3m_e c`\n\n4.  **Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle:**\n    *   The initial momentum was entirely in the horizontal (x) direction. Therefore, the vertical (y) components of the photons' momenta must cancel out. Since the photons have equal momentum magnitudes, they must be emitted at symmetric angles above and below the horizontal axis. Let this angle be `θ`.\n    *   The final horizontal momentum is the sum of the horizontal components of the two photon momenta.\n        *   `P_final = p_photon * cos(θ) + p_photon * cos(θ) = 2 * p_photon * cos(θ)`\n    *   Equating initial and final momentum:\n        *   `P_initial = P_final`\n        *   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c = 2 * (3m_e c) * cos(θ)`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Angle:**\n    *   We can cancel the `m_e c` term from both sides and simplify:\n        *   `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n        *   `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n    *   Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n        *   `sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873`\n        *   `sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732`\n        *   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n    *   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n    *   The question asks for the angle **between** the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n        *   Total Angle = `2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°`\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Relativistic Formulas:** It is crucial to use the relativistic formulas for energy and momentum, not the classical ones (`E=1/2 mv²`, `p=mv`), as the particles are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light.\n*   **Vector Nature of Momentum:** Momentum is a vector. The initial momenta of the electron and positron are in opposite directions, so they must be subtracted to find the net initial momentum of the system.\n*   **Symmetry in the Final State:** Because the initial momentum is purely horizontal, the final state must also have zero net vertical momentum. Since the two photons have equal energy (and thus momentum magnitude), this forces them to be emitted at symmetric angles (`+θ` and `-θ`) relative to the horizontal axis.\n*   **The Angle `2θ`:** The calculation solves for `θ`, the angle of one photon relative to the axis of initial motion. The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n*   **Matching Result to Options:** The calculated value of ~138.2° must be compared to the given options: A) 96, B) 138, C) 74, D) 172.

Identify Governing Physical Principles**\nThe problem involves particles moving at relativistic speeds (indicated by Lorentz factors `γ > 1`) that annihilate. Therefore, the solution must be based on the principles of **conservation of energy** and **conservation of momentum** from Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Initial State of the System**\nFirst, we calculate the total energy and momentum of the electron-positron pair before they collide.

A crucial point here is that momentum is a vector.\n    *   Let's define the direction of the electron's motion (from left to right) as the positive x-axis.\n    *   Electron's momentum (`p_e`): `p_e = m_e c √(4² - 1) = m_e c √15`.\n    *   Positron's momentum (`p_p`): It moves in the opposite (-x) direction. `p_p = -m_e c √(2² - 1) = -m_e c √3`.\n    *   **Total Initial Momentum (`P_initial`)**: This is the vector sum, which simplifies to an algebraic sum along the x-axis: `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)m_e c`.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Final State of the System**\nThe final state consists of two photons with equal energy.\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The total initial energy is converted into the energy of the two photons (`E_γ`).\n    *   `E_initial = E_final`  =>  `6m_e c² = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n    *   Therefore, the energy of each photon is `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n\n*   **Photon Momentum:** The momentum of a photon is `p = E/c`.\n    *   The magnitude of each photon's momentum is `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3m_e c`.\n\n### **4. Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle**\nThis is the most critical calculation step.\n*   The initial momentum was purely horizontal. To conserve momentum, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel out. Since their momentum magnitudes are equal, they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis. Let this angle be `θ`.\n*   **Careful Point:** The question asks for the angle *between* the photons, which is `2θ`, not `θ`.\n*   The final horizontal momentum is the sum of the horizontal components of each photon's momentum: `P_final = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n*   Equating the initial and final momentum:\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2p_γ cos(θ)`\n*   Substitute the value of `p_γ = 3m_e c`:\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2(3m_e c)cos(θ)`\n*   Cancel `m_e c` from both sides and solve for `cos(θ)`:\n    `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n\n### **5.

Let's define the direction of the electron's motion (from left to right) as the positive x-direction.\n\n*   **Electron's Momentum (p_e):** `p_e = m_e c * √(4² - 1) = m_e c * √15`.\n*   **Positron's Momentum (p_p):** It moves in the opposite direction, so its momentum is negative. `p_p = -m_e c * √(2² - 1) = -m_e c * √3`.\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (P_initial):** The total momentum is the vector sum, which in this one-dimensional case is the algebraic sum:\n    `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)m_e c`.\n    The initial momentum in the vertical direction is zero.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Final State (Two Photons)**\nAfter annihilation, the total energy and momentum are carried by two photons.\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The total initial energy is divided equally between the two photons, as stated in the problem. Let the energy of each photon be `E_γ`.\n    `E_initial = 2E_γ` => `6m_e c² = 2E_γ` => `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n*   **Photon Momentum:** The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`. Therefore, the magnitude of each photon's momentum is `p_γ = 3m_e c`.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle**\nThe total momentum of the system must be conserved.\n*   Since the initial vertical momentum was zero, the final vertical momentum must also be zero. As the two photons have equal momentum magnitude, they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis. Let this angle be `θ`.\n*   The final horizontal momentum is the sum of the horizontal components of each photon's momentum: `P_final = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n*   Equating the initial and final horizontal momentum:\n    `P_initial = P_final`\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2p_γ cos(θ)`\n*   Substitute the value `p_γ = 3m_e c`:\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2(3m_e c)cos(θ)`\n    `(√15 - √3) = 6cos(θ)`\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the Angle**\nWe can now solve for `θ`.\n*   `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n*   Using a calculator:\n    `cos(θ) ≈ (3.87298 - 1.73205) / 6 = 2.14093 / 6 ≈ 0.35682`\n*   `θ = arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69.1°`\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n*   **Total Angle = 2θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°**\n\nThis value is closest to 138.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Relativistic Formulas**: The Lorentz factors are significantly greater than 1, so using classical formulas for energy (`1/2 mv²`) and momentum (`mv`) would give an incorrect result. Relativistic formulas `E = γmc²` and `p = mc√(γ² - 1)` are essential.\n2.  **Momentum as a Vector**: Momentum is a vector. The total initial momentum is the vector sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. Since they move in opposite directions, their momenta are subtracted.\n3.  **Conservation of Momentum Components**: The conservation of momentum applies to each spatial component independently. The fact that the initial vertical momentum is zero is a key constraint on the final state, forcing the photons to be emitted at symmetric angles.\n4.  **Angle Definition**: The calculation yields `θ`, which is the angle of each photon relative to the central axis.

Here is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Physical Principles:** The collision involves particles at relativistic speeds (Lorentz factors > 1), so we must use the laws of conservation of relativistic energy and momentum.\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Energy:** The relativistic energy of a particle is `E = γmc²`.\n    *   Energy of the electron (`γ_e = 4`): `E_e = 4m_e c²`.\n    *   Energy of the positron (`γ_p = 2`): `E_p = 2m_e c²`.\n    *   **Total Initial Energy:** `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6m_e c²`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Initial Momentum:** The relativistic momentum is `p = √(γ² - 1)mc`. Momentum is a vector. Let's define the electron's direction of motion (from the left) as the positive x-direction.\n    *   Momentum of the electron: `p_e = √(4² - 1)m_e c = √15 m_e c`.\n    *   Momentum of the positron (moving from the right, in the negative direction): `p_p = -√(2² - 1)m_e c = -√3 m_e c`.\n    *   **Total Initial Momentum:** `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)m_e c`. This momentum is entirely along the horizontal axis.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Final State (Two Photons):**\n    *   **Energy Conservation:** The initial energy is converted into two photons of equal energy, `E_γ`.\n        `E_initial = 2E_γ` => `6m_e c² = 2E_γ` => `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n    *   **Photon Momentum:** For a photon, `E = pc`. The momentum magnitude of each photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3m_e c`.\n\n5.  **Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle:**\n    *   The initial momentum was purely horizontal. To conserve momentum, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel out. Since their momentum magnitudes are equal, they must be emitted at symmetric angles `+θ` and `-θ` relative to the horizontal axis.\n    *   The final horizontal momentum is the sum of the horizontal components of the two photon momenta: `P_final = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n    *   Equating initial and final horizontal momentum:\n        `P_initial = P_final`\n        `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2 * (3m_e c) * cos(θ)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the Angle:**\n    *   We can cancel the `m_e c` term from both sides and solve for `cos(θ)`:\n        `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n    *   Numerically:\n        `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n    *   This gives `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`.\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n        **Total Angle = 2θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°**\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Relativistic Formulas:** It is crucial to use the correct relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n*   **Vector Nature of Momentum:** The opposite directions of the initial particles must be accounted for when summing their momenta.\n*   **Final Angle:** The question asks for the total angle between the photons (`2θ`), not the angle of one photon relative to the axis (`θ`).\n*   **Matching to Options:** The calculated value of `138.2°` is closest to the option **138**. In the original question, this corresponds to option D. Several candidate answers correctly calculate the value but then select the wrong letter.\n\nThe correct calculation consistently yields a result of approximately 138 degrees.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points needed to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### **1. Identify the Governing Physical Principles**\nThe problem involves the annihilation of an electron and a positron moving at relativistic speeds. Therefore, the solution must be derived from the laws of **conservation of energy** and **conservation of momentum** as formulated in Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Initial State of the System (Before Collision)**\nWe must first determine the total energy and total momentum of the electron-positron pair. Let `m_e` be the rest mass of the electron (and positron) and `c` be the speed of light.\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The energy of a particle is given by `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The momentum `p` is given by `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`.\n\nLet's define the horizontal axis as the x-axis, with the electron's motion from left to right being the positive direction.\n\n*   **Electron (e⁻):**\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`.\n    *   Energy: `E_e = 4m_e c²`.\n    *   Momentum: `p_e = m_e c√(4² - 1) = m_e c√15` (in the +x direction).\n\n*   **Positron (e⁺):**\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`.\n    *   Energy: `E_p = 2m_e c²`.\n    *   Momentum: `p_p = m_e c√(2² - 1) = m_e c√3` (in the -x direction).\n\n*   **Total Initial System:**\n    *   **Total Energy (`E_initial`):** Energy is a scalar, so we add the individual energies.\n        `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6m_e c²`.\n    *   **Total Momentum (`P_initial`):** Momentum is a vector. We must account for the opposite directions of motion.\n        `P_initial = p_e - p_p = (√15 - √3)m_e c`. This net momentum is in the positive x-direction.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Final State of the System (After Annihilation)**\nThe initial particles annihilate, creating two photons.\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The total initial energy is converted into the energy of the two photons. The problem states they have equal energy, `E_γ`.\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `6m_e c² = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`\n    This gives the energy of each photon: `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n\n*   **Photon Momentum:** For a photon, the relationship between energy and momentum is `E = pc`.\n    The magnitude of each photon's momentum is `p_γ = E_γ / c = (3m_e c²) / c = 3m_e c`.\n\n### **4. Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle**\nThe total momentum of the system must be conserved.\n\n*   **Vertical Momentum (y-direction):** The initial momentum in the vertical direction was zero. For the final vertical momentum to also be zero, the vertical components of the two photons' momenta must cancel each other out. Since the photons have equal momentum magnitudes, they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis. Let this angle be `θ`.\n\n*   **Horizontal Momentum (x-direction):** The initial horizontal momentum must equal the final horizontal momentum. The final horizontal momentum is the sum of the horizontal components of the two photons' momenta.\n    `P_final_x = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n\n*   Equating the initial and final horizontal momentum:\n    `P_initial = P_final_x`\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2p_γ cos(θ)`\n\n### **5. Solve for the Angle**\nNow we substitute the value of `p_γ = 3m_e c` into the momentum conservation equation:\n`(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2(3m_e c)cos(θ)`\n\nWe can cancel the `m_e c` term from both sides:\n`√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`\n\nSolving for `cos(θ)`:\n`cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n*   `√15 ≈ 3.873`\n*   `√3 ≈ 1.732`\n*   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n\nThis gives the angle `θ` for one photon relative to the horizontal axis:\n`θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n\n### **6. Determine the Final Answer**\nA crucial point is to answer the specific question asked: \"What is the angle **between** the directions of the photons?\". Since one photon travels at an angle of `+θ` to the horizontal and the other at `-θ`, the total angle between them is `2θ`.\n\nTotal Angle = `2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°`.\n\nThis calculated value is closest to the option **138**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nOf course.

Therefore, the principles of special relativity must be used. The classical formulas for energy and momentum are not applicable.\n2.  **Vector Nature of Momentum:** Momentum is a vector quantity. The electron and positron are moving in opposite directions, so their momenta must be treated with opposite signs when calculating the total initial momentum of the system.\n3.  **Conservation Laws:** The two fundamental principles governing the interaction are the conservation of total energy and the conservation of total momentum. The total energy and momentum of the system before the annihilation must equal the total energy and momentum of the two photons after.\n4.  **Symmetry of the Final State:** The initial momentum is entirely along the horizontal axis (the vertical component is zero). To conserve momentum, the total vertical momentum of the two photons must also be zero. Since the photons have equal energy (and therefore equal momentum magnitude), they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles relative to the horizontal axis.\n5.  **Distinction Between `θ` and `2θ`:** The angle `θ` derived from the momentum conservation equations represents the angle of *each* photon relative to the horizontal axis.

Momentum is a vector quantity. Let's define the direction of the electron's motion (from left to right) as the positive x-direction.\n\n*   **Electron's Momentum (p_e):** `p_e = m_e c * √(4² - 1) = m_e c * √15`.\n*   **Positron's Momentum (p_p):** It moves in the opposite direction, so its momentum is negative. `p_p = -m_e c * √(2² - 1) = -m_e c * √3`.\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (P_initial):** The total momentum is the vector sum, which in this one-dimensional case is the algebraic sum:\n    `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)m_e c`.\n    The initial momentum in the vertical direction is zero.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Final State (Two Photons)**\nAfter annihilation, the total energy and momentum are carried by two photons.\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The total initial energy is divided equally between the two photons, as stated in the problem. Let the energy of each photon be `E_γ`.\n    `E_initial = 2E_γ` => `6m_e c² = 2E_γ` => `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n*   **Photon Momentum:** The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`. Therefore, the magnitude of each photon's momentum is `p_γ = 3m_e c`.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle**\nThe total momentum of the system must be conserved.\n*   Since the initial vertical momentum was zero, the final vertical momentum must also be zero. As the two photons have equal momentum magnitude, they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis. Let this angle be `θ`.\n*   The final horizontal momentum is the sum of the horizontal components of each photon's momentum: `P_final = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n*   Equating the initial and final horizontal momentum:\n    `P_initial = P_final`\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2p_γ cos(θ)`\n*   Substitute the value `p_γ = 3m_e c`:\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2(3m_e c)cos(θ)`\n    `(√15 - √3) = 6cos(θ)`\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the Angle**\nWe can now solve for `θ`.\n*   `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n*   Using the approximate values `√15 ≈ 3.873` and `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n    `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n*   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n*   **Total Angle = 2θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°**\n\nThis value is closest to 138.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Relativistic Formulas:** The Lorentz factors are significantly greater than 1, so using classical formulas for energy (`1/2 mv²`) and momentum (`mv`) would give an incorrect result. Relativistic formulas `E = γmc²` and `p = mc√(γ² - 1)` are essential.\n2.  **Momentum as a Vector:** Momentum is a vector. The total initial momentum is the vector sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. Since they move in opposite directions, their momenta are subtracted.\n3.  **Conservation of Momentum Components:** The conservation of momentum applies to each spatial component independently. The fact that the initial vertical momentum is zero is a key constraint on the final state, forcing the photons to be emitted at symmetric angles.\n4.  **Angle Definition:** The calculation yields `θ`, which is the angle of each photon relative to the central axis. The question asks for the total angle *between* the photons, which is `2θ`.\n5.  **Mapping to Options:** The calculated value of ~138.2° must be correctly matched to the given options. In this case, 138 is option B. Many of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed at this final mapping step.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers and the underlying physics, here is a step-by-step solution with careful points highlighted.\n\nThe physical principles and mathematical steps are overwhelmingly consistent across all candidate answers. The main source of error in the provided answers is incorrectly mapping the final calculated value to the given multiple-choice options. The physics itself is sound.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Governing Principles:** The problem involves particles moving at high speeds (indicated by Lorentz factors greater than 1) and an annihilation event. Therefore, the solution must be based on the principles of **conservation of energy** and **conservation of momentum** from the theory of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial State (Before Collision):** We first calculate the total energy and total momentum of the electron-positron system. Let `m_e` be the rest mass of the electron (and positron) and `c` be the speed of light.\n    *   **Electron (e⁻):** Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`. It moves from the left, which we define as the positive (+) x-direction.\n        *   Energy: `E_e = γ_e * m_e * c² = 4m_e c²`\n        *   Momentum: `p_e = m_e * c * sqrt(γ_e² - 1) = m_e * c * sqrt(4² - 1) = sqrt(15) m_e c`\n    *   **Positron (e⁺):** Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`. It moves from the right, which is the negative (-) x-direction.\n        *   Energy: `E_p = γ_p * m_e * c² = 2m_e c²`\n        *   Momentum: `p_p = -m_e * c * sqrt(γ_p² - 1) = -m_e * c * sqrt(2² - 1) = -sqrt(3) m_e c`\n    *   **Total Initial System:**\n        *   Total Energy: `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6m_e c²`\n        *   Total Momentum: `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c` (This is a vector sum, entirely along the x-axis).\n\n3.  **Analyze Final State (After Annihilation):** The system becomes two photons.\n    *   **Energy Conservation:** The total initial energy is divided equally between the two photons.\n        *   `E_final = E_initial` => `2 * E_photon = 6m_e c²`\n        *   Energy per photon: `E_photon = 3m_e c²`\n    *   **Photon Momentum:** The momentum of a photon is `p = E/c`.\n        *   Momentum per photon: `p_photon = E_photon / c = 3m_e c`\n\n4.  **Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle:**\n    *   The initial momentum was entirely in the horizontal (x) direction. Therefore, the vertical (y) components of the photons' momenta must cancel out. Since the photons have equal momentum magnitudes, they must be emitted at symmetric angles above and below the horizontal axis. Let this angle be `θ`.\n    *   The final horizontal momentum is the sum of the horizontal components of the two photon momenta.\n        *   `P_final = p_photon * cos(θ) + p_photon * cos(θ) = 2 * p_photon * cos(θ)`\n    *   Equating initial and final momentum:\n        *   `P_initial = P_final`\n        *   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c = 2 * (3m_e c) * cos(θ)`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Angle:**\n    *   We can cancel the `m_e c` term from both sides and simplify:\n        *   `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n        *   `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n    *   Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n        *   `sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873`\n        *   `sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732`\n        *   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n    *   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n    *   The question asks for the angle **between** the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n        *   Total Angle = `2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°`\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Relativistic Formulas:** It is crucial to use the relativistic formulas for energy and momentum, not the classical ones (`E=1/2 mv²`, `p=mv`), as the particles are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light.\n*   **Vector Nature of Momentum:** Momentum is a vector. The initial momenta of the electron and positron are in opposite directions, so they must be subtracted to find the net initial momentum of the system.\n*   **Symmetry in the Final State:** Because the initial momentum is purely horizontal, the final state must also have zero net vertical momentum. Since the two photons have equal energy (and thus momentum magnitude), this forces them to be emitted at symmetric angles (`+θ` and `-θ`) relative to the horizontal axis.\n*   **The Angle `2θ`:** The calculation solves for `θ`, the angle of one photon relative to the axis of initial motion. The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n*   **Matching Result to Options:** The calculated value of ~138.2° must be compared to the given options: A) 96, B) 138, C) 74, D) 172. The closest match is 138.\n\nThe final calculated value is approximately 138.2°, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo decide the final answer, it is essential to perform a careful, step-by-step analysis of the problem, paying close attention to the points where errors could occur. An analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the physical method and the numerical result, but confusion in selecting the final lettered option.\n\nHere is a definitive breakdown of the solution:\n\n### **1. Identify Governing Physical Principles**\nThe problem involves particles moving at relativistic speeds (indicated by Lorentz factors `γ > 1`) that annihilate. Therefore, the solution must be based on the principles of **conservation of energy** and **conservation of momentum** from Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Initial State of the System**\nFirst, we calculate the total energy and momentum of the electron-positron pair before they collide. Let `m_e` be the rest mass of the electron (and positron) and `c` be the speed of light.\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The formula is `E = γmc²`.\n    *   Electron's energy (`E_e`): With `γ_e = 4`, the energy is `E_e = 4m_e c²`.\n    *   Positron's energy (`E_p`): With `γ_p = 2`, the energy is `E_p = 2m_e c²`.\n    *   **Total Initial Energy (`E_initial`)**: `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6m_e c²`.\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The formula is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. A crucial point here is that momentum is a vector.\n    *   Let's define the direction of the electron's motion (from left to right) as the positive x-axis.\n    *   Electron's momentum (`p_e`): `p_e = m_e c √(4² - 1) = m_e c √15`.\n    *   Positron's momentum (`p_p`): It moves in the opposite (-x) direction. `p_p = -m_e c √(2² - 1) = -m_e c √3`.\n    *   **Total Initial Momentum (`P_initial`)**: This is the vector sum, which simplifies to an algebraic sum along the x-axis: `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)m_e c`.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Final State of the System**\nThe final state consists of two photons with equal energy.\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The total initial energy is converted into the energy of the two photons (`E_γ`).\n    *   `E_initial = E_final`  =>  `6m_e c² = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n    *   Therefore, the energy of each photon is `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n\n*   **Photon Momentum:** The momentum of a photon is `p = E/c`.\n    *   The magnitude of each photon's momentum is `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3m_e c`.\n\n### **4. Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle**\nThis is the most critical calculation step.\n*   The initial momentum was purely horizontal. To conserve momentum, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel out. Since their momentum magnitudes are equal, they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis. Let this angle be `θ`.\n*   **Careful Point:** The question asks for the angle *between* the photons, which is `2θ`, not `θ`.\n*   The final horizontal momentum is the sum of the horizontal components of each photon's momentum: `P_final = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n*   Equating the initial and final momentum:\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2p_γ cos(θ)`\n*   Substitute the value of `p_γ = 3m_e c`:\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2(3m_e c)cos(θ)`\n*   Cancel `m_e c` from both sides and solve for `cos(θ)`:\n    `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n\n### **5. Numerical Calculation and Final Decision**\n*   Using the values `√15 ≈ 3.873` and `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n    `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n*   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n*   The total angle between the photons is `2θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°`.\n\nThis calculated value of 138.2° is extremely close to the value of 138 provided in option A. The overwhelming consensus of the candidate answers confirms this calculation, even if some select the wrong letter due to inconsistent option listings.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",
