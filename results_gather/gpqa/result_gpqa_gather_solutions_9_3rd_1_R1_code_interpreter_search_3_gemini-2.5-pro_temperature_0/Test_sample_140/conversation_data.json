The deuterium at C2 remains. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** Removal of D from C2 and Br from C1 leads to a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n    Therefore, two distinct benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Nucleophilic attack can occur at either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n        1.  Attack at C1 gives **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  Attack at C6 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        This pathway yields **two** distinct products.\n\n    *   **Product from benzyne (Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium. Attack at either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C2) leads to the same single product.\n        3.  The product is **aniline**.\n        This pathway yields **one** distinct product.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy combining the products from all possible pathways, we find three unique organic molecules:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nThe total number of possible organic products is **3**.\n\n### Evaluation of Candidate Answers\nThe vast majority of the candidate answers correctly reason that there are 3 possible products by identifying the two benzyne intermediates and their subsequent reaction products. However, many of them incorrectly map the number 3 to the multiple-choice options. The provided options are A) 1, B) 4, C) 2, D) 3. Therefore, the correct choice is D.\n\nThe reasoning in answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 is overwhelmingly consistent in deriving 3 products. The final letter choice is the main point of divergence. Based on the correct chemical analysis, the number of products is 3, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reaction Mechanism\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an **elimination-addition reaction**. All candidate answers correctly identify this. The key feature of this mechanism is the formation of a highly reactive **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Elimination Step (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)\nThe first step is the abstraction of a proton (or deuteron) by the strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Two distinct ortho positions.** The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two different ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   The C6 position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   The C2 position has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Two possible elimination pathways.** The question asks for all *possible* organic products. Therefore, both potential elimination pathways must be considered, even though one is kinetically favored.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains, yielding **3-deuterobenzyne**. This pathway is faster due to the kinetic isotope effect (a C-H bond is weaker than a C-D bond).\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed from the molecule in this step, yielding the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nConclusion for Step 2: Two different benzyne intermediates are possible.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Addition Step (Nucleophilic Attack)\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Nucleophilic attack can occur at either carbon of the triple bond, leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. The carbanion at C6 is protonated, yielding **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. The carbanion at C1 is protonated. When the ring is renumbered to give the amino group the #1 position, the deuterium is at position 3, yielding **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond results in the same single product after protonation.\n    3.  The product is **aniline**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count of Products\nBy considering all possible pathways, we find three unique organic products. These molecules are isotopomers and are chemically distinct.\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of **3** possible organic products. This corresponds to option A.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while almost all of them correctly deduce that 3 products are formed, many make an error in matching this number to the correct letter option. The chemical reasoning across the board consistently points to 3 products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction**\nThe reaction is between 1-bromobenzene-2-d and sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia. This is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe strong base, amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton or deuteron from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom. The starting material has two different ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** Has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** Has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both abstraction pathways, even though one is kinetically favored.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes the proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Careful Point:** The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) makes breaking a C-H bond faster than a C-D bond, so Pathway A is the major route. However, Pathway B is still possible and must be included to find all possible products. This leads to **two different benzyne intermediates**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Intermediates)**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. The final product is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. After renumbering to prioritize the amino group, the final product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *This pathway yields two distinct products.*\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium. Attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to the same single product.\n    3.  The final product is **aniline**.\n    *This pathway yields one distinct product.*\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nBy combining the products from all possible pathways, we find three unique organic molecules:\n1.

Identify the Reaction Type and Mechanism**\nThe reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) treated with sodium amide (NaNH₂), a very strong base, in liquid ammonia. These are the classic conditions for a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**. The key reactive intermediate in this mechanism is a **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr).

Although abstraction of H is kinetically favored over D (due to the kinetic isotope effect, where C-H bonds break more easily than C-D bonds), both pathways are possible and will occur.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule.

Identify the Reaction Mechanism**\nThe reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia. These are the classic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction, which proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called a **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe reaction is initiated by the amide ion (NH₂⁻), which acts as a strong base. It abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom that is *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine leaving group.\n\nIn the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon is bonded to a deuterium atom (D).\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both abstraction events, even though H-abstraction is faster than D-abstraction due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-H bonds are weaker than C-D bonds).\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched.\n    4.  This forms the intermediate **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule in this process.\n    4.  This forms the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\nTherefore, two different benzyne intermediates are possible.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond.

The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products:\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the amino group the lowest number (C1), the deuterium is at position C3.

This is a benzene ring substituted with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position C2. The positions adjacent (ortho) to the bromine are C2 (with deuterium) and C6 (with hydrogen).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** These conditions are classic for an **elimination-addition reaction**, which proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Elimination Pathways to Form Intermediates\n\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr). The strong base, NH₂⁻, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho to the bromine.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Two possible abstraction sites.** There are two different ortho positions: C6 with a hydrogen (H) and C2 with a deuterium (D).\n*   **Careful Point 2: Both pathways must be considered.** The question asks for all *possible* products. Even though breaking a C-H bond is kinetically faster than breaking a C-D bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect), both pathways are possible and will occur.\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes the H from C6. Subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is untouched. This forms the first intermediate: **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes the D from C2. Subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed from the molecule in this step. This forms the second intermediate: **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\nTherefore, two distinct benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Addition Pathways to Form Final Products\n\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH₂⁻), attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either of the two carbons in the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. The resulting carbanion at C6 is protonated, yielding **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. The resulting carbanion at C1 is protonated. When the ring is renumbered to give the -NH₂ group the lowest number (1), the deuterium is at position 3.

All candidate answers correctly identify this. The key feature of this mechanism is the formation of a highly reactive **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Elimination Step (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)\nThe first step is the abstraction of a proton (or deuteron) by the strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Two distinct ortho positions.** The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two different ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   The C6 position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   The C2 position has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Two possible elimination pathways.** The question asks for all *possible* organic products. Therefore, both potential elimination pathways must be considered, even though one is kinetically favored.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains, yielding **3-deuterobenzyne**. This pathway is faster due to the kinetic isotope effect (a C-H bond is weaker than a C-D bond).\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed from the molecule in this step, yielding the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nConclusion for Step 2: Two different benzyne intermediates are possible.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Addition Step (Nucleophilic Attack)\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Nucleophilic attack can occur at either carbon of the triple bond, leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. The carbanion at C6 is protonated, yielding **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. The carbanion at C1 is protonated. When the ring is renumbered to give the amino group the #1 position, the deuterium is at position 3, yielding **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond results in the same single product after protonation.\n    3.  The product is **aniline**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count of Products\nBy considering all possible pathways, we find three unique organic products. These molecules are isotopomers and are chemically distinct.\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of **3** possible organic products. This corresponds to option A.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while almost all of them correctly deduce that 3 products are formed, many make an error in matching this number to the correct letter option. The chemical reasoning across the board consistently points to 3 products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n**1.

Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Careful Point:** The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) makes breaking a C-H bond faster than a C-D bond, so Pathway A is the major route. However, Pathway B is still possible and must be included to find all possible products. This leads to **two different benzyne intermediates**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Intermediates)**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. The final product is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. After renumbering to prioritize the amino group, the final product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *This pathway yields two distinct products.*\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium. Attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to the same single product.\n    3.  The final product is **aniline**.\n    *This pathway yields one distinct product.*\n\n**4.

Identify the Reaction Type and Mechanism**\nThe reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) treated with sodium amide (NaNH₂), a very strong base, in liquid ammonia. These are the classic conditions for a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**. The key reactive intermediate in this mechanism is a **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr). The strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Two possible abstraction sites.** The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two different ortho positions:\n    *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Position C2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Both pathways must be considered.** The question asks for all *possible* organic products. Although abstraction of H is kinetically favored over D (due to the kinetic isotope effect, where C-H bonds break more easily than C-D bonds), both pathways are possible and will occur.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nTherefore, two distinct benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the amino group the #1 position, the deuterium is at the #3 position. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *This pathway yields two distinct products.*\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack by the nucleophile at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product.\n    3.  The product is **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n    *This pathway yields one distinct product.*\n\n**4. Conclusion: Counting the Unique Products**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products. These are isotopomers and are chemically unique molecules.\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction Mechanism**\nThe reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia. These are the classic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction, which proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called a **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe reaction is initiated by the amide ion (NH₂⁻), which acts as a strong base. It abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom that is *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine leaving group.\n\nIn the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon is bonded to a deuterium atom (D).\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both abstraction events, even though H-abstraction is faster than D-abstraction due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-H bonds are weaker than C-D bonds).\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched.\n    4.  This forms the intermediate **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule in this process.\n    4.  This forms the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\nTherefore, two different benzyne intermediates are possible.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃), which provides a regular hydrogen atom (H).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products:\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the amino group the lowest number (C1), the deuterium is at position C3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The addition of the -NH₂ group followed by protonation results in **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we can identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n2.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.

This is a benzene ring substituted with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position C2. The positions adjacent (ortho) to the bromine are C2 (with deuterium) and C6 (with hydrogen).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** These conditions are classic for an **elimination-addition reaction**, which proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Elimination Pathways to Form Intermediates\n\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr). The strong base, NH₂⁻, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho to the bromine.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Two possible abstraction sites.** There are two different ortho positions: C6 with a hydrogen (H) and C2 with a deuterium (D).\n*   **Careful Point 2: Both pathways must be considered.** The question asks for all *possible* products. Even though breaking a C-H bond is kinetically faster than breaking a C-D bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect), both pathways are possible and will occur.\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes the H from C6. Subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is untouched. This forms the first intermediate: **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes the D from C2. Subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed from the molecule in this step. This forms the second intermediate: **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\nTherefore, two distinct benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Addition Pathways to Form Final Products\n\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH₂⁻), attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical.

The resulting carbanion at C6 is protonated, yielding **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. The resulting carbanion at C1 is protonated. When the ring is renumbered to give the -NH₂ group the lowest number (1), the deuterium is at position 3. This yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   This pathway produces **two** distinct products.\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):** This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium.

Identify the Reaction Mechanism**\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**. The key intermediate in this reaction is a highly reactive species called **benzyne**. This was correctly identified by all candidate answers.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe first step is the abstraction of a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* to the bromine atom by the strong base, amide (NH₂⁻).\n\n*   **Careful Point: Two Ortho Positions.** The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two different ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   **Position C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n*   **Careful Point: Two Possible Pathways.** Since the question asks for all *possible* organic products, both potential elimination pathways must be considered, even though one is kinetically favored.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes the proton from C6. Subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. (This is the major pathway due to the kinetic isotope effect, as C-H bonds break more easily than C-D bonds).\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nTherefore, two distinct benzyne intermediates are possible.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond.

The chemical logic is sound and consistently points to 3 products.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reaction Mechanism\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in liquid ammonia as an **elimination-addition reaction** that proceeds through a **benzyne intermediate**. This is the correct mechanism for these reactants and conditions.\n\n### Step 2: Identify All Possible Elimination Pathways\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr), which is initiated by the strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻). The base abstracts a proton or deuteron from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d.\n*   **Ortho Positions:**\n    *   C6 has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   C2 has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* organic products, both potential abstraction sites must be considered, even though abstraction of H is kinetically favored over D (due to the kinetic isotope effect).\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction from C6):** This is the major pathway. The removal of H from C6 and Br from C1 results in a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction from C2):** This is a minor but possible pathway. The removal of D from C2 and Br from C1 results in a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed from the molecule. The intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nConclusion of Step 2: Two distinct benzyne intermediates are possible.\n\n### Step 3: Identify All Possible Addition Products\nThe second step is the nucleophilic addition of the amide ion (NH₂⁻) to the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. Protonation of the carbanion at C6 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. Protonation of the carbanion at C1 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   This pathway produces **two** distinct products.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product: **aniline**.\n    *   This pathway produces **one** distinct product.\n\n### Step 4: Consolidate and Count the Unique Products\nBy combining the products from all possible pathways, we get the following set of unique organic molecules:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nThere are a total of **3** possible organic products.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe chemical reasoning across almost all candidate answers is sound and consistently leads to the conclusion that 3 products are formed. The discrepancy in the final letter choices of many candidates appears to be a simple error in mapping the number 3 to the correct option letter.\n\nBased on the provided options:\nA) 4\nB) 1\nC) 2\nD) 3\n\nThe correct answer is 3, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final answer.\n\n**1.
