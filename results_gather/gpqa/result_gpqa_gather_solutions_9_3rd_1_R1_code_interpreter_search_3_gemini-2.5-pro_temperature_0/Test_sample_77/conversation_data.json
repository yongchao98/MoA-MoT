These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The solution involves recalling or deriving the standard formulas and comparing them to the provided options.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The question concerns the electromagnetic potentials from a moving point charge. The fundamental principle is **retardation**: because electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`, the potentials at an observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, $t_r$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas:** The standard textbook expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    All quantities on the right-hand side ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, and $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$, consistent with the problem's notation.\n\n3.  **Reformat the Expressions for Comparison:** The options provided have a slightly different algebraic structure. We can obtain this form by manipulating the denominator of the standard expressions. By finding a common denominator of `c`, the denominator term becomes:\n    $d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    Substituting this back into the potential formulas requires multiplying the numerator by `c` as well:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: Incorrect. This uses the static Coulomb potential, which is only valid for a stationary charge and neglects retardation.\n    *   **B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: **Correct.** These expressions perfectly match the derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   **C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: Incorrect. This also uses the static potential and has a dimensionally incorrect formula for the vector potential.\n    *   **D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: Incorrect. The plus sign in the denominator corresponds to a non-physical \"advanced potential,\" which violates causality.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Retardation is Essential:** The potentials depend on the charge's state at the retarded time $t_r$, not the observation time $t$. Any formula based on the static potential (like options A and C) is fundamentally incorrect for a moving charge.\n*   **The Denominator is Key:** The term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ is the defining feature of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. It is not simply proportional to the distance `d` but includes a crucial correction factor that accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect of the moving source.\n*   **The Sign is Crucial:** The negative sign in the denominator is a direct result of the derivation and the physics of retardation. It correctly describes that the potential is stronger if the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$). A positive sign (as in option D) is incorrect for physical, causal fields.\n*   **Consistency Check:** The correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials satisfy the relation $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$. Using the identity $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_0\\epsilon_0)$, we can verify this for option B:\n    $\\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V = \\vec{v}\\mu_0\\epsilon_0 \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\vec{A}$. The relationship holds.\n\nBased on the rigorous derivation and analysis, option B is the only one that correctly represents the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge. The candidate answers unanimously agree on the correct physical formulas, even if their final letter choices differ due to shuffled options.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The solution involves a step-by-step derivation and careful comparison with the given options.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Concept**: The question asks for the electromagnetic potentials of a moving point charge. The fundamental principle is **retardation**. Because electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light `c`, the potentials at an observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are determined not by the charge's current state, but by its state (position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ and velocity $\\vec{v}$) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time $t_r$.\n\n2.  **The Retarded Time Condition**: The retarded time $t_r$ is defined by the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observer. Using the problem's notation, this is given by the condition $t - t_r = d/c$, where $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n\n3.  **Recall the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas**: The standard solutions to Maxwell's equations for a moving point charge are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    All quantities on the right-hand side ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, and $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n4.  **Reformat the Expressions to Match the Options**: The options provided have a different algebraic structure in the denominator. We can obtain this form by finding a common denominator of `c` within the brackets:\n    $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    Substituting this back into the potential formulas gives:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options**:\n    *   **A)** This option uses the static potential form $V \\propto q/r$, which is incorrect as it ignores retardation.\n    *   **B)** This option has a plus sign (`+`) in the denominator. This is incorrect and corresponds to a non-physical \"advanced potential\" that violates causality.\n    *   **C)** This option's expressions for both $V(\\vec{r},t)$ and $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t)$ perfectly match the correctly derived formulas.\n    *   **D)** This option also uses the incorrect static potential form.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Retardation is Essential**: The potentials depend on the charge's state at the retarded time $t_r$, not the observation time $t$. Any formula based on the static Coulomb law (like in options A and D) is incorrect for a moving charge.\n*   **The Denominator is Crucial**: The term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ is the key feature of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. It is not simply proportional to the distance `d`. This factor accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect on the potential.\n*   **The Sign is Negative**: The minus sign in the denominator is a critical result of the derivation. It correctly describes that the potential is stronger if the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$) and weaker if it is moving away. A plus sign (as in option B) is physically incorrect.\n*   **Relationship between V and A**: A useful check is that for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the two are related by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. Using the identity $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o\\epsilon_o)$, the expressions in option C correctly satisfy this relationship, providing an additional verification.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis and a review of the candidate answers (which overwhelmingly agree on the physical derivation, despite differing final letter choices due to shuffled options), the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on the provided answers from other agents, here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Concept**: The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge.

This is a fundamental problem in classical electrodynamics, and the solutions are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. The key physical principle that distinguishes this from a static case is **retardation**. Because electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`, the potentials at an observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time $t_r$.\n\n2.  **Define Variables and Retarded Time:**\n    *   The retarded time $t_r$ is the time at which the electromagnetic signal was emitted from the charge.\n    *   The observation time is $t$.\n    *   The time it takes for the signal to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observer is $t - t_r$.\n    *   The distance this signal travels is $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    *   This leads to the retarded time condition: $t - t_r = d/c$.\n    *   The other variables are defined as in the problem: $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the retarded position to the observer, and $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the charge's velocity at the retarded time.\n\n3.  **Recall the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas:** The standard textbook derivation from Maxwell's equations yields the following formulas for the potentials, where all source quantities are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\n4.  **Adapt the Formulas to Match the Options:** The options provided in the question have a slightly different algebraic form.

Because electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`, the potentials at an observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, $t_r$.\n\n2.  **Define Variables**: The problem defines the variables based on this retarded time framework:\n    *   $q$: The point charge.\n    *   $t_r$: The retarded time, at which the field was generated.\n    *   $t$: The time of observation.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The observation point.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The distance from the retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   The retarded time condition is $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n3.  **Recall the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas**: The standard textbook expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    All quantities on the right-hand side are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n4.  **Adapt Formulas to Match the Options**: The options provided have a slightly different algebraic structure. We can obtain this form by manipulating the denominator of the standard expressions. By finding a common denominator of `c`, the denominator term becomes:\n    $d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    Substituting this back into the potential equations:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options**:\n    *   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: Incorrect. The plus sign in the denominator corresponds to a non-physical \"advanced potential,\" which violates causality.\n    *   **B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: **Correct**. These expressions exactly match the derived formulas for both the scalar and vector potentials.\n    *   **C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: Incorrect. This uses the static Coulomb potential for V, which does not account for the motion of the charge or the retardation of the field. The expression for A is also incorrect.\n    *   **D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: Incorrect. This also uses the static potential for V. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the base expression for V is wrong.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Retardation is Essential**: The potentials depend on the charge's state at the retarded time $t_r$, not the observation time $t$. Any formula based on the static potential ($V \\propto q/r$) is incorrect.\n*   **The Denominator is Key**: The term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ is the defining feature of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. It accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect; the potential is stronger if the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$) and weaker if it is moving away.\n*   **The Sign is Crucial**: The negative sign in the denominator is a direct result of the derivation and the physics of retardation. A positive sign, as seen in option A, corresponds to a non-physical, non-causal \"advanced potential\".\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers**: All provided candidate answers correctly derive the same physical formulas.

    "This problem requires identifying the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge.

The fundamental principle governing this scenario is **retardation**. Because electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`, the potentials measured at an observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are determined by the charge's state (its position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ and velocity $\\vec{v}$) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. The time difference, $t - t_r$, is the time it took for the signal to travel from the charge to the observer, which is given by the condition $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas**: The standard textbook derivation from Maxwell's equations for a moving point charge yields the following potentials. All source-related quantities ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\n3.  **Reformat the Formulas for Comparison**: The options provided in the question use a slightly different algebraic form.

While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the base expression for V is wrong.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Retardation is Essential**: The potentials depend on the charge's state at the *retarded time* ($t_r$), not the observation time ($t$).

Because electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`, the potentials at an observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time $t_r$.\n\n2.  **Define Variables and Retarded Time:**\n    *   The retarded time $t_r$ is the time at which the electromagnetic signal was emitted from the charge.\n    *   The observation time is $t$.\n    *   The time it takes for the signal to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observer is $t - t_r$.\n    *   The distance this signal travels is $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    *   This leads to the retarded time condition: $t - t_r = d/c$.\n    *   The other variables are defined as in the problem: $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the retarded position to the observer, and $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the charge's velocity at the retarded time.\n\n3.  **Recall the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas:** The standard textbook derivation from Maxwell's equations yields the following formulas for the potentials, where all source quantities are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\n4.  **Adapt the Formulas to Match the Options:** The options provided in the question have a slightly different algebraic form. We can obtain this form by manipulating the denominator of the standard expressions. By finding a common denominator of `c`, we get:\n    $d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    Substituting this back into the potential formulas gives:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: Incorrect.

By finding a common denominator of `c`, the denominator term becomes:\n    $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    Substituting this back into the potential equations gives:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options**:\n    *   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: Incorrect. This uses the static potential, which neglects retardation, and the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is dimensionally incorrect.\n    *   **B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: **Correct**. These expressions perfectly match the derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   **C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: Incorrect. The plus sign in the denominator is physically incorrect. It corresponds to a non-causal \"advanced potential,\" where the effect precedes the cause.\n    *   **D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: Incorrect. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the base expression for V is the static potential, which is wrong for a moving charge.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Retardation is Essential**: The potentials depend on the charge's position and velocity at the *retarded time* $t_r$, not the observation time $t$. Any formula based on the static Coulomb law (like in options A and D) is incorrect.\n*   **The Denominator is Key**: The term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ is the defining feature of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. It is not simply proportional to the distance `d` but includes a crucial correction factor that accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect of the moving source.\n*   **The Sign is Crucial**: The negative sign in the denominator is a direct result of the derivation and the physics of retardation. It correctly describes that the potential is stronger if the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$). A positive sign (as in option C) is incorrect for physical, causal fields.\n*   **Consistency Check**: The correct potentials satisfy the relationship $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$. Using the identity $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_0\\epsilon_0)$, one can verify that the expressions in option B are consistent with this relationship.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The solution involves recalling or deriving the standard formulas and comparing them to the provided options after some algebraic manipulation.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Concept**: The question asks for the electromagnetic potentials of a moving point charge. The fundamental principle is **retardation**. Because electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`, the potentials at an observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, $t_r$.\n\n2.  **Define Variables**: The problem defines the variables based on this retarded time framework:\n    *   $q$: The point charge.\n    *   $t_r$: The retarded time, at which the field was generated.\n    *   $t$: The time of observation.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The observation point.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The distance from the retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   The retarded time condition is $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n3.  **Recall the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas**: The standard textbook expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    All quantities on the right-hand side are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n4.  **Adapt Formulas to Match the Options**: The options provided have a slightly different algebraic structure. We can obtain this form by manipulating the denominator of the standard expressions. By finding a common denominator of `c`, the denominator term becomes:\n    $d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    Substituting this back into the potential equations:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options**:\n    *   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: Incorrect. The plus sign in the denominator corresponds to a non-physical \"advanced potential,\" which violates causality.\n    *   **B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: **Correct**. These expressions exactly match the derived formulas for both the scalar and vector potentials.\n    *   **C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: Incorrect. This uses the static Coulomb potential for V, which does not account for the motion of the charge or the retardation of the field. The expression for A is also incorrect.\n    *   **D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: Incorrect. This also uses the static potential for V. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the base expression for V is wrong.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Retardation is Essential**: The potentials depend on the charge's state at the retarded time $t_r$, not the observation time $t$. Any formula based on the static potential ($V \\propto q/r$) is incorrect.\n*   **The Denominator is Key**: The term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ is the defining feature of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. It accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect; the potential is stronger if the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$) and weaker if it is moving away.\n*   **The Sign is Crucial**: The negative sign in the denominator is a direct result of the derivation and the physics of retardation. A positive sign, as seen in option A, corresponds to a non-physical, non-causal \"advanced potential\".\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers**: All provided candidate answers correctly derive the same physical formulas.
