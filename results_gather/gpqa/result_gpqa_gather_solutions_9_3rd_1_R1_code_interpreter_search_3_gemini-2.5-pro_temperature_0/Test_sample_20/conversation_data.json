This process requires the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen,\" which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has three ketone groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp³-hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** In p-benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bond system. They are sp²-hybridized and do not have the required alpha-hydrogens for keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to hydroquinone is a reduction reaction (it changes the molecular formula), not an isomerization. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Part B - Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound that **will** show optical isomerism from the pair: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n\n*   **Principle:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature that causes chirality is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  -H (hydrogen)\n    2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n    3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n    4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene. It is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Step 3: Synthesize the Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we match this combination with the given options:\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct combination of our findings corresponds directly to option A.\n\n**Careful Point:** All candidate answers reached the correct scientific conclusions for both parts of the question. However, many of them made an error in the final step by incorrectly matching their findings to the lettered options. The chemical analysis is sound and consistently points to the same pair of compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism**\n\n1.  **Principle of Tautomerism**: The question refers to keto-enol tautomerism. For this to occur, a molecule with a carbonyl group (keto form) must have a hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (the alpha-carbon). This alpha-hydrogen is typically on an sp³ hybridized carbon.\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This molecule has three ketone (C=O) groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. Each is a CH₂ group, meaning they are sp³ hybridized and possess two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism to form its highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: In p-benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized and do not have the required alpha-hydrogens for keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to its corresponding phenol-like structure (hydroquinone) is a reduction reaction that changes the molecular formula (from C₆H₄O₂ to C₆H₆O₂), not an isomerization like tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism**\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism**: This property is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   -H (a hydrogen atom)\n    *   -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n    *   -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n    *   -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore **will** show optical isomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B**: The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nWe must now match this pair with the given options:\n*   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   B) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   D) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct combination of our findings corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first break down the question into two parts, just as the candidate agents did.\n1.  **Part A: Tautomerism.** I will determine which of the two compounds, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does not show tautomerism. The key principle here is the requirement of an alpha-hydrogen on an sp³-hybridized carbon for keto-enol tautomerism.\n2.  **Part B: Optical Isomerism.** I will determine which of the two compounds, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, will show optical isomerism. The key principle here is chirality, which is most commonly identified by the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n3.  **Final Decision.** After identifying the correct compound for Part A and Part B, I will match this pair to the given multiple-choice options to find the correct answer.\n\nThe code will programmatically follow these steps to arrive at the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_isomerism_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the chemical properties of the given compounds\n    to determine the correct answer for the multiple-choice question.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze Part A (Tautomerism) ---\n    # The question asks for the compound that does NOT show tautomerism.\n    # Keto-enol tautomerism requires an alpha-hydrogen on an sp3 carbon.\n    # - Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha-hydrogens and DOES show tautomerism.\n    # - Benzoquinone lacks the required alpha-hydrogens and DOES NOT show tautomerism.\n    compound_A = \"benzoquinone\"\n    print(f\"Step 1: Analysis of Tautomerism.\")\n    print(f\"   - Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha-hydrogens, so it shows tautomerism.\")\n    print(f\"   - Benzoquinone lacks the required alpha-hydrogens, so it does not show tautomerism.\")\n    print(f\"   - Conclusion for (A): The compound that does not show tautomerism is {compound_A}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Analyze Part B (Optical Isomerism) ---\n    # The question asks for the compound that WILL show optical isomerism.\n    # Optical isomerism requires a chiral center (a carbon with 4 different groups).\n    # - Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a central carbon bonded to -H, -OH, -CH3, and -COOCH3.

This process requires the presence of at least one \"alpha-hydrogen\" – a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   This molecule has a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups.\n    *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are located between the ketone groups.

Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups in benzoquinone are part of C=C double bonds and are sp²-hybridized. They do not have the required alpha-hydrogens for keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to hydroquinone is a reduction (a change in molecular formula), not an isomerization. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism**\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism**: This property is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since the four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene. It is planar and has a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Achiral molecules do not exhibit optical isomerism. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B**: The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nWe must now match this pair with the given options:\n*   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct combination is found in option B.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The scientific analysis across all candidate answers was unanimously correct.\n*   The primary source of error in the candidate answers was the final step of matching the correct scientific conclusion (A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) to the corresponding letter option. This highlights the importance of carefully reading and matching the final answer to the options provided.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe task is to identify two compounds based on their chemical properties and then select the correct multiple-choice option.\n*   **Compound A:** The one that **does not** show tautomerism. The candidates are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n*   **Compound B:** The one that **will** show optical isomerism. The candidates are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Part A (Tautomerism)**\n\n*   **Core Principle:** The most common type of tautomerism for these compounds is keto-enol tautomerism. A key requirement for this is the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen\"—a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has three ketone groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups. These are sp³-hybridized carbons adjacent to the carbonyls, and they possess alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism, readily forming the highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** This molecule has two ketone groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the ketone groups are part of these double bonds (they are sp²-hybridized) and do not have the required alpha-hydrogens for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Part B (Optical Isomerism)**\n\n*   **Core Principle:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C-2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  -H (hydrogen)\n    2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n    3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n    4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is a planar molecule (the *trans*-isomer) and possesses a center of symmetry. It has no chiral centers and is achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Step 4: Synthesize the Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound A = **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound B = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nNow, we must carefully match this pair with the given options:\n*   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   B) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   D) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct option that matches both conclusions is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism**\n\n1.  **Principle of Tautomerism**: The question refers to keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit this, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen, and the carbon it's attached to (the alpha-carbon) must typically be sp³ hybridized to allow for the proton transfer and bond rearrangement.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:\n    *   This molecule has three ketone groups on a six-membered ring. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are located between the ketone groups.\n    *   These carbons are sp³ hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism. Its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is exceptionally stable due to aromaticity.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone)**:\n    *   This molecule has two ketone groups and two C=C double bonds in a six-membered ring.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the ketone groups are part of the C=C double bonds. They are sp² hybridized and have no attached hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since benzoquinone lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon, it **does not** show keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n**Therefore, the compound for (A) is benzoquinone.**\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism**\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism**: This property is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is the *trans* isomer of an alkene.\n    *   The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. It has no chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion**: As an achiral molecule, dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n\n**Therefore, the compound for (B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.**\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nWe must now match this pair to the given options:\n*   A) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   D) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct combination is found in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Consensus on Part A (Tautomerism)**\n\nThe first task is to identify which compound, between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Key Principle:** All candidate answers correctly identify that keto-enol tautomerism requires an \"alpha-hydrogen\" on an sp³-hybridized carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** There is a unanimous consensus among all candidate answers that this compound **does** show tautomerism. It has alpha-hydrogens on its sp³ carbons, allowing it to form a very stable aromatic enol (phloroglucinol).\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** There is also a unanimous consensus that benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism. Its alpha-carbons are sp² hybridized and lack the necessary type of alpha-hydrogens.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** Based on the consistent and correct reasoning from all sources, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Consensus on Part B (Optical Isomerism)**\n\nThe second task is to identify which compound, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, **will show** optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Key Principle:** All candidate answers correctly state that optical isomerism requires the molecule to be chiral, which is commonly identified by the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** There is a unanimous consensus that this compound **will show** optical isomerism. All answers correctly identify that its central carbon (C-2) is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, -CH₃, and -COOCH₃), making it a chiral center.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** There is a unanimous consensus that this compound **will not** show optical isomerism. It is correctly identified as a planar, achiral molecule with a center of symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** Based on the consistent and correct reasoning from all sources, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Step 3: Synthesize the Final Answer and Match to Options**\n\nCombining the conclusions from the analysis:\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nNow, we must match this pair to the given multiple-choice options:\n*   A) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   C) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe combination of \"A = benzoquinone\" and \"B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\" directly corresponds to option C.\n\n**Careful Point:** While the scientific reasoning in almost all candidate answers is correct, many of them failed in the final step of matching their correct conclusions to the correct option letter. By performing this final step carefully, we can confidently determine the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on a synthesis of the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Part A - Tautomerism**\n\nThe first task is to identify which compound, between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Core Principle:** The most common type of tautomerism for these compounds is keto-enol tautomerism.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.

This process requires the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen,\" which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has three ketone groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp³-hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** In p-benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bond system. They are sp²-hybridized and do not have the required alpha-hydrogens for keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to hydroquinone is a reduction reaction (it changes the molecular formula), not an isomerization. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Part B - Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound that **will** show optical isomerism from the pair: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n\n*   **Principle:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature that causes chirality is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  -H (hydrogen)\n    2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n    3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n    4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene. It is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Step 3: Synthesize the Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we match this combination with the given options:\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct combination of our findings corresponds directly to option A.\n\n**Careful Point:** All candidate answers reached the correct scientific conclusions for both parts of the question. However, many of them made an error in the final step by incorrectly matching their findings to the lettered options. The chemical analysis is sound and consistently points to the same pair of compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism**\n\n1.  **Principle of Tautomerism**: The question refers to keto-enol tautomerism. For this to occur, a molecule with a carbonyl group (keto form) must have a hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (the alpha-carbon). This alpha-hydrogen is typically on an sp³ hybridized carbon.\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This molecule has three ketone (C=O) groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. Each is a CH₂ group, meaning they are sp³ hybridized and possess two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism to form its highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: In p-benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized and do not have the required alpha-hydrogens for keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to its corresponding phenol-like structure (hydroquinone) is a reduction reaction that changes the molecular formula (from C₆H₄O₂ to C₆H₆O₂), not an isomerization like tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism**\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism**: This property is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   -H (a hydrogen atom)\n    *   -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n    *   -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n    *   -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore **will** show optical isomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B**: The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nWe must now match this pair with the given options:\n*   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   B) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   D) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct combination of our findings corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first break down the question into two parts, just as the candidate agents did.\n1.  **Part A: Tautomerism.** I will determine which of the two compounds, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does not show tautomerism.

This process requires the presence of at least one \"alpha-hydrogen\" – a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   This molecule has a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups.\n    *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are located between the ketone groups.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center – a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene.\n    *   The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry.

A key requirement for this is the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen\"—a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group. This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. They are CH₂ groups, meaning they are sp³ hybridized and possess alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of these double bonds (sp² hybridized) and lack the required alpha-hydrogens for keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to hydroquinone is a reduction reaction (change in molecular formula), not an isomerization. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Part B - Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound that **will** show optical isomerism from the pair: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n\n*   **Core Principle:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules.

The most common cause of chirality is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C-2) is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  -H (hydrogen)\n    2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n    3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n    4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is the *trans*-alkene, which is a planar molecule. It possesses a center of symmetry and is therefore achiral. Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Step 3: Synthesize the Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nNow, we match this combination with the given options:\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct combination is found in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nThe first task is to identify which compound, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n1.  **Core Principle:** The most common form of tautomerism for these compounds is keto-enol tautomerism. This process requires the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen\"—a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. This alpha-carbon must be able to re-hybridize, which typically means it is sp³ hybridized.\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups. The carbons located between them (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are sp³ hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these hydrogens allows the molecule to readily undergo tautomerism to form its highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n3.  **Benzoquinone:** In this molecule, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp² hybridized and have no attached hydrogens. Lacking the necessary alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone **does not** show keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe second task is to identify which compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Core Principle:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules.

The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since it has a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and **will** show optical isomerism.\n3.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene. It is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. It has no chiral centers.

For a compound to exhibit this, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen, and the carbon it's attached to (the alpha-carbon) must typically be sp³ hybridized to allow for the proton transfer and bond rearrangement.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:\n    *   This molecule has three ketone groups on a six-membered ring. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are located between the ketone groups.\n    *   These carbons are sp³ hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism. Its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is exceptionally stable due to aromaticity.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone)**:\n    *   This molecule has two ketone groups and two C=C double bonds in a six-membered ring.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the ketone groups are part of the C=C double bonds. They are sp² hybridized and have no attached hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since benzoquinone lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon, it **does not** show keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n**Therefore, the compound for (A) is benzoquinone.**\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism**\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism**: This property is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

It has alpha-hydrogens on its sp³ carbons, allowing it to form a very stable aromatic enol (phloroglucinol).\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** There is also a unanimous consensus that benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism. Its alpha-carbons are sp² hybridized and lack the necessary type of alpha-hydrogens.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** Based on the consistent and correct reasoning from all sources, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Consensus on Part B (Optical Isomerism)**\n\nThe second task is to identify which compound, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, **will show** optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Key Principle:** All candidate answers correctly state that optical isomerism requires the molecule to be chiral, which is commonly identified by the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** There is a unanimous consensus that this compound **will show** optical isomerism. All answers correctly identify that its central carbon (C-2) is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, -CH₃, and -COOCH₃), making it a chiral center.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** There is a unanimous consensus that this compound **will not** show optical isomerism. It is correctly identified as a planar, achiral molecule with a center of symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** Based on the consistent and correct reasoning from all sources, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Step 3: Synthesize the Final Answer and Match to Options**\n\nCombining the conclusions from the analysis:\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nNow, we must match this pair to the given multiple-choice options:\n*   A) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   C) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe combination of \"A = benzoquinone\" and \"B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\" directly corresponds to option C.\n\n**Careful Point:** While the scientific reasoning in almost all candidate answers is correct, many of them failed in the final step of matching their correct conclusions to the correct option letter. By performing this final step carefully, we can confidently determine the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on a synthesis of the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Part A - Tautomerism**\n\nThe first task is to identify which compound, between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Core Principle:** The most common type of tautomerism for these compounds is keto-enol tautomerism. This process requires the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen\"—a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp³-hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism to form its highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of these double bonds (they are sp²-hybridized) and lack the required alpha-hydrogens for keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Conclusion for Part A:** All candidate answers correctly conclude that the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Part B - Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe second task is to identify which compound, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, **will show** optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Core Principle:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C-2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since it has a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene. It is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, it **will not** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Conclusion for Part B:** All candidate answers correctly conclude that the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Synthesis and Matching**\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct scientific reasoning from all candidate answers, we have:\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nNow, we match this definitive conclusion with the options provided in the question:\n\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe combination of our findings perfectly matches option A. The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers appear to be due to errors in matching their correct scientific conclusions to an inconsistent or misremembered list of options. The chemical analysis itself is sound and points to only one correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### **Part A: Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\nThe first task is to identify which compound, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n1.  **Principle of Tautomerism**: The relevant type is keto-enol tautomerism. A key requirement for this is the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen\"—a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: All candidate answers correctly identify that this compound has methylene (CH₂) groups between the carbonyl groups. These are sp³-hybridized alpha-carbons with alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**, readily forming its stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: All candidate answers correctly identify that the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp²-hybridized and lack the necessary alpha-hydrogens for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe second task is to identify which compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism**: This property is exhibited by chiral molecules. A common feature of a chiral molecule is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: All candidate answers correctly analyze the structure CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. They identify that the second carbon is bonded to four distinct groups: -H, -OH, -CH₃, and -COOCH₃. This makes it a chiral center. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: All candidate answers correctly identify this molecule as a planar, trans-alkene. It possesses a center of symmetry and has no chiral centers, making it achiral. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B**: The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe analysis consistently leads to the following conclusions:\n*   Compound **(A)**, which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **(B)**, which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we must match this pair to the given options:\n*   A) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct combination of our findings corresponds directly to option B. A careful point to note is that while the chemical analysis in the candidate answers was almost universally correct, many failed to correctly map their findings to the final lettered option.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism**\n\n1.  **Principle of Tautomerism**: The question refers to keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit this, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen, and the carbon it is attached to (the alpha-carbon) must typically be sp³ hybridized to allow for the shift.\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This molecule has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons is a CH₂ group, meaning they are sp³ hybridized and possess two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism to form its highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: In p-benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the two carbonyl groups are part of carbon-carbon double bonds within the ring. These carbons are sp² hybridized and do not have the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon to participate in standard keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to its corresponding phenol (hydroquinone) is a reduction reaction (a change in molecular formula from C₆H₄O₂ to C₆H₆O₂), not an isomerization. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism**\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism**: Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C-2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and **will** show optical isomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃). It is a planar molecule and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. It does not have a chiral center. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   Compound **A** (the one that does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** (the one that will show optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nWe must now match this pair with the given options:\n*   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   C) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct combination is found in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Part A - Tautomerism**\n\nThe first task is to identify which compound, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Key Principle:** The most common form of tautomerism for these compounds is keto-enol tautomerism. This process requires the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen\"—a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This alpha-carbon must be sp³ hybridized to allow for the proton transfer and bond rearrangement.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** All candidate answers correctly note that this molecule has three ketone groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp³ hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism to form its highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** All candidate answers correctly identify that in benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of C=C double bonds (sp² hybridized). They lack the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Part B - Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe second task is to identify which compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Key Principle:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules.

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Decision**\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct chemical analysis from all candidate answers, we can conclude:\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we match this conclusion to the options provided in the question:\n*   A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   C) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe combination of our findings directly matches option A.\n\n**Careful Point:** While the chemical analysis in the candidate answers is overwhelmingly correct, there is significant confusion in matching the correct chemical pair to the final lettered option.
