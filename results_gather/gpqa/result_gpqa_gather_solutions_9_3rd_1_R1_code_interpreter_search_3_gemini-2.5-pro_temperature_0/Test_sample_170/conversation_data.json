Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The key factors determining this yield are the directing effects (ortho, para vs. meta) and the specific steric and electronic properties of each substituent.\n\n**Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first and most important step is to separate the compounds into two groups based on their directing effect. This establishes the broad structure of the final sequence.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis classification confirms that the final order must have the meta-directors (4, 6, 2) at the beginning (lowest yields) and the ortho, para-directors (1, 5, 3) at the end (highest yields). The structure of the answer must be `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group; a stronger deactivating group directs more exclusively to the meta position, resulting in an even lower para-yield.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO₂`) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester group (`-COOC₂H₅`) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of their deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased steric hindrance near the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) will have a higher para-isomer yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high yield of the para-isomer (typically ~87-89%), which is higher than that for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the low-yield meta-directors before the high-yield ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 6: Match with the Provided Options**\nComparing the derived sequence with the given choices:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThe chemically correct sequence, `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`, matches option B. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly identified the chemical principles, many failed to match their derived sequence to the correct letter option. The consensus on the chemical reasoning strongly supports this final order.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Goal**\nThe objective is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers for a given starting material is identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The task is therefore to order the substances by increasing para-isomer percentage yield.\n\n**Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe most important factor determining the para-isomer yield is the directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring. This allows us to separate the compounds into two distinct groups.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield Group):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield Group):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with the meta-directors {4, 6, 2} and end with the ortho, para-directors {1, 5, 3}.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nWithin this low-yield group, the amount of para-isomer produced is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n*   The nitro group (`-NO2`) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups, leading to the lowest para-yield.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester (`-COOC2H5`) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nWithin this high-yield group, the order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, with the low-yield meta-directors preceding the high-yield ortho, para-directors, we arrive at the final sequence.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 6: Match the Final Order with the Given Options**\nThe derived chemically correct sequence is `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`. Comparing this with the provided options:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe derived sequence perfectly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by breaking it down into logical chemical principles, which is the consensus approach among the provided candidate answers. I will then use a Python script to implement this logic and derive the final order.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Classify Substituents:** I will first categorize the six substituents on the benzene ring into two groups:\n    *   **Meta-directors:** These groups produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups produce a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    This initial grouping establishes the overall structure of the final sequence.\n\n2.  **Order the Meta-Directors:** Within the low-yield group, the order is determined by the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower para-yield. I will order them from lowest to highest para-yield.\n\n3.  **Order the Ortho, Para-Directors:** Within the high-yield group, the order is determined by factors that increase the para-to-ortho product ratio, primarily steric hindrance and electronic effects. I will order them from lowest to highest para-yield.\n\n4.  **Combine and Finalize:** I will combine the two ordered groups to get the final sequence.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that assigns representative para-yield percentages to each substance based on these chemical principles. The script will then sort the substances according to these yields and print the final ordered sequence of numbers.\n\n```python\ndef determine_bromination_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the order of benzene derivatives based on increasing yield of the\n    para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define substances and assign representative para-yield percentages\n    # based on established chemical principles.

This determines whether the incoming bromine electrophile will be directed to the meta position (resulting in a low para-yield) or to the ortho and para positions (resulting in a high para-yield).\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (Low para-yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups (High para-yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with the meta-directors (4, 6, 2) and end with the ortho, para-directors (1, 5, 3).\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para-Yield Group)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group; a stronger deactivating group directs more exclusively to the meta position, resulting in an even lower para-yield.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups, leading to the lowest para-yield.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is more deactivating than the ester group (-COOC₂H₅) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of their deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para-Yield Group)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary factor is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more likely site for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a special case. While it is deactivating overall, its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (typically ~87-90%) is higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the low-yield meta-directors before the high-yield ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Match with the Provided Options**\nComparing the derived sequence with the given choices:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe chemically correct sequence, `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Core Principles**\nThe task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) is the same for a given starting material, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The yield is determined by the directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first step is to classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This separates the compounds into two groups with vastly different para-isomer yields.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.

The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group; a stronger deactivating group directs more exclusively to the meta position, resulting in an even lower para-yield.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO₂`) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester group (`-COOC₂H₅`) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of their deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) in substance 5 is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`) in substance 1. This increased steric hindrance near the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) will have a higher para-isomer yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) in substance 3 is strongly para-directing.

As correctly noted by all candidate answers, since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting substance is identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\n### **Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe most critical step is to classify the substituents based on their directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This creates two distinct groups with vastly different yields of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitro group)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Carboxylic acid group)\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ester group)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Methyl group)\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethyl group)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chloro group)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with the meta-directors {4, 6, 2} and end with the ortho, para-directors {1, 5, 3}.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para-Yield)**\n\nWithin the group of meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A more powerful deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para and ortho isomers.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO2`) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester (`-COOC2H5`) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing character.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para-Yield)**\n\nWithin the group of ortho, para-directors, the order depends on the factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance (Comparing 1 and 5):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic and Steric Effects (Comparing with 3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is a deactivating but strongly para-directing substituent. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is experimentally known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the two ordered subgroups, we arrive at the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 6: Match with the Given Options**\n\nComparing the derived sequence with the provided choices:\n*   A) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n*   B) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n*   C) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n*   D) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nThe chemically correct sequence `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3` perfectly matches option A. The analysis presented in the candidate answers is unanimously correct in its chemical reasoning, even though many failed to match their result to the correct option letter.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers for a given starting material is identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. Therefore, the task is to order the substances by increasing percentage yield of the para-product.\n\n**Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe most critical factor determining the para-isomer yield is the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring. We can separate the substances into two distinct groups:\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield)**\n    These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer is very low.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   *Conclusion*: These three substances will have the lowest para-yields and will appear at the beginning of the final sequence.\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield)**\n    These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n    *   *Conclusion*: These three substances will have the highest para-yields and will appear at the end of the final sequence.\n\nBased on this grouping, the final order must be of the form: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor this group, the para-isomer yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, which results in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is more deactivating than the ester group (-COOC₂H₅) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor this group, the order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (-Cl) is highly para-directing. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high yield of the para-isomer, which is typically higher than that for simple alkylbenzenes like toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Combining these factors, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the low-yield meta-directors before the high-yield ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, final order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses and chemical principles.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of **increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer** formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers for a given starting substance is identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\n### **Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe most important factor determining para-isomer yield is the directing effect of the substituent group. This allows us to separate the substances into two distinct categories.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, making the para-isomer a major product.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial grouping establishes that the final sequence must begin with substances {4, 6, 2} and end with substances {1, 5, 3}. This immediately eliminates options C and D.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nWithin this low-yield group, the amount of para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO2`) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is slightly more deactivating than the ester (`-COOC2H5`) because the electron-donating ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing effect.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nWithin this high-yield group, the order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance (Comparing 1 and 5):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more likely site for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic and Steric Effects (Comparing with 3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is highly para-directing. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene in bromination (~87%) is higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy concatenating the two ordered groups, we obtain the final sequence from the lowest to the highest para-isomer yield.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 6: Match with the Given Options**\nThe derived sequence is `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`. Comparing this with the provided options:\n\n*   **A) 4<6<2<1<5<3**\n*   B) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n*   C) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n*   D) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe derived sequence perfectly matches option A. The vast majority of the candidate answers arrived at this same chemical sequence, even if some mapped it to an incorrect letter. The chemical reasoning is sound and consistent.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first and most important step is to classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This separates the compounds into two distinct groups based on their expected para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must have the meta-directors (4, 6, 2) at the beginning (lowest yields), followed by the ortho, para-directors (1, 5, 3) at the end (highest yields). The overall structure of the answer must be: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para-Yield Group)**\nFor meta-directors, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group—a stronger deactivating group directs more exclusively to the meta position, resulting in an even lower para yield.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO₂` > `-COOH` > `-COOC₂H₅`.\n    *   The `-NO₂` group is one of the strongest deactivators, leading to the lowest para yield.\n    *   The `-COOH` group is more deactivating than the `-COOC₂H₅` group because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is the reverse of their deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para-Yield Group)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) in substance 5 is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`) in substance 1. This increased steric hindrance near the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) will have a higher para-isomer yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) in substance 3 is strongly ortho, para-directing. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (~89%) is typically higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**5. Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the low-yield meta-directors before the high-yield ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**6. Match with the Provided Options**\nComparing the derived sequence with the given choices:\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nThe chemically correct sequence, `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`, perfectly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe goal is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of **increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer** formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molecular weight of the monobrominated products (ortho, meta, para) is the same for any given starting material, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Consensus Reasoning**\n\nA review of all 15 candidate answers reveals a strong and unanimous consensus on the underlying chemical principles and the logical steps to solve the problem. The analysis can be broken down into three main parts.\n\n**Part A: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nAll agents correctly separate the substances into two groups:\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis establishes that the final sequence must be of the form `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**Part B: Order the Meta-Directors**\nAll agents correctly reason that for meta-directors, the para-yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivator is more selective for the meta position, producing an even lower para-yield.\n*   The consensus order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Part C: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors**\nAll agents correctly reason that for ortho, para-directors, the order depends on factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution, primarily steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`), so it blocks the ortho positions more effectively. This leads to a higher para-yield for ethylbenzene (5) than for toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing due to its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect, which deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This results in a very high para-yield, greater than that for both toluene and ethylbenzene. The order is **5 < 3**.\n*   Combining these gives the order for this group: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 3: Synthesize the Final Order and Match to Options**\n\nCombining the results from the two groups gives the final, complete sequence for increasing para-isomer yield.\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n*   **Final Combined Order:** **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nNow, we match this consensus-derived sequence to the given options:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe derived sequence **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3** perfectly matches option **C**.\n\n**Note on Candidate Errors:** While the chemical reasoning across all 15 candidates was unanimously correct, many of them failed in the final step of matching their derived sequence to the correct letter option, leading to a variety of incorrect final answers (A, B, D). The analysis of the core reasoning, however, points unambiguously to C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Core Chemical Principles**\n\nThe question asks to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molar mass of all monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe key factors determining the yield of the para-isomer are:\n1.  **Directing Effect:** Substituents are either *ortho, para-directing* or *meta-directing*. Meta-directors will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer, while ortho, para-directors will produce a high yield.\n2.  **Deactivating Strength:** For meta-directors, a stronger deactivating group leads to a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n3.  **Steric and Electronic Effects:** For ortho, para-directors, factors like steric hindrance and the electronic nature of the substituent influence the ratio of para to ortho product.\n\n### **Step 2: Classify the Substituents and Group the Substances**\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent and group the substances accordingly.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-directors (Low para-yield)**\n    These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-**NO₂** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-**COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-**COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, para-directors (High para-yield)**\n    These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-**CH₃** (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-**C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-**Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial grouping tells us that the final order must be `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Meta-Directors (Group 1)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the para-yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is slightly more deactivating than the ester group (-COOC₂H₅) because the electron-donating ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing effect.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n    *   **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n### **Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Group 2)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield depends on the ratio of para to ortho product, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the ortho positions, making the para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene has a higher para-yield than toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is highly para-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric hindrance, results in a very high para-yield (typically ~87-89%), which is generally higher than that for alkylbenzenes like toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the complete order for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### **Step 5: Combine the Orders for the Final Sequence**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final arrangement from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### **Step 6: Match with the Given Options**\n\nComparing the derived sequence with the provided choices:\nA) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThe correct sequence, **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**, matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal and Core Principles**\n\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molar mass of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe key factors determining the yield of the para-isomer are:\n1.  **Directing Effect:** Substituents are either *meta-directing* or *ortho, para-directing*. Meta-directors produce a very low yield of the para-isomer, while ortho, para-directors produce a high yield.\n2.  **Steric and Electronic Effects:** For ortho, para-directors, factors like the size of the substituent (steric hindrance) and its electronic properties influence the ratio of para to ortho product.\n\n### **Step 2: Classify the Substituents and Group the Substances**\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent and group the substances accordingly. This creates a broad initial order.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-directors (Low para-yield)**\n    These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-**NO₂** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-**COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-**COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   *Conclusion:* This group will form the beginning of our ordered list (lowest para-yield).\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, para-directors (High para-yield)**\n    These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-**CH₃** (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-**C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-**Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n    *   *Conclusion:* This group will form the end of our ordered list (highest para-yield).\n\nThe final order must have the structure: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Group 1)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the para-yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO₂`) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester group (`-COOC₂H₅`) because the electron-donating alkyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing effect.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength.\n*   **Order for Group 1:** `4 < 6 < 2`\n\n### **Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Group 2)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield depends on the ratio of para to ortho product, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary factor is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1).\n    *   Order: `1 < 5`\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (`-Cl`) is highly para-directing. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high para-to-ortho ratio.

Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to arrange the six given benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during an electrophilic bromination reaction. Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers for a given starting substance is identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**2. Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first and most critical step is to classify each substituent based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This divides the compounds into two distinct groups based on their expected para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Isomer Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer is very low.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Isomer Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with the meta-directors (substances 4, 6, and 2) and end with the ortho, para-directors (substances 1, 5, and 3).\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor this group, the para-isomer yield is minimal. The yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent; a stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups due to strong inductive and resonance electron withdrawal.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is more deactivating than the ester group (-COOC₂H₅) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing strength.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor this group, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The primary factor is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more likely site for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a special case. While it is deactivating overall, its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**5. Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy concatenating the two ordered groups, we obtain the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the final answer, a systematic analysis of the chemical principles governing electrophilic aromatic substitution is required. The weight fraction of the para-isomer is directly proportional to its percentage yield.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe first step is to separate the substances into two groups based on the directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring. This is the most significant factor determining the yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with substances 4, 6, and 2, and end with substances 1, 5, and 3. The overall structure of the answer will be: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor this group, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO₂`) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester group (`-COOC₂H₅`) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor this group, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The primary factor is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more likely site for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the two ordered subgroups, we obtain the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the final answer, a systematic analysis of the chemical principles governing electrophilic aromatic substitution is required. The task is to arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during bromination. Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers for a given starting material is identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first and most important step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring. This determines whether the incoming bromine atom is directed primarily to the meta position (resulting in a low para-yield) or to the ortho and para positions (resulting in a high para-yield).\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with substances 4, 6, and 2, and end with substances 1, 5, and 3.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group; a stronger deactivating group directs more selectively to the meta position, resulting in an even lower para-yield.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups due to strong inductive and resonance electron withdrawal.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is slightly more deactivating than the ester group (-COOC₂H₅) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of their deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) in substance 5 is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃) in substance 1. This increased steric hindrance near the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) will have a higher para-isomer yield than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (-Cl) in substance 3 is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, with the low-yield meta-directors preceding the high-yield ortho,para-directors, we arrive at the final sequence.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho,para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Match with the Provided Options**\nComparing the derived sequence with the given choices:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThe chemically correct sequence, `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

Deconstruct the Question**\nThe goal is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. A key point, correctly identified by all candidate answers, is that for any given starting substance, the molecular weight of the monobrominated products (ortho, meta, para) is the same.

Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The key factors determining this yield are the directing effects (ortho, para vs. meta) and the specific steric and electronic properties of each substituent.\n\n**Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first and most important step is to separate the compounds into two groups based on their directing effect. This establishes the broad structure of the final sequence.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis classification confirms that the final order must have the meta-directors (4, 6, 2) at the beginning (lowest yields) and the ortho, para-directors (1, 5, 3) at the end (highest yields). The structure of the answer must be `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group; a stronger deactivating group directs more exclusively to the meta position, resulting in an even lower para-yield.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO₂`) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester group (`-COOC₂H₅`) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of their deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased steric hindrance near the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) will have a higher para-isomer yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high yield of the para-isomer (typically ~87-89%), which is higher than that for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the low-yield meta-directors before the high-yield ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 6: Match with the Provided Options**\nComparing the derived sequence with the given choices:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThe chemically correct sequence, `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`, matches option B. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly identified the chemical principles, many failed to match their derived sequence to the correct letter option. The consensus on the chemical reasoning strongly supports this final order.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Goal**\nThe objective is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers for a given starting material is identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The task is therefore to order the substances by increasing para-isomer percentage yield.\n\n**Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe most important factor determining the para-isomer yield is the directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring. This allows us to separate the compounds into two distinct groups.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield Group):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield Group):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with the meta-directors {4, 6, 2} and end with the ortho, para-directors {1, 5, 3}.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nWithin this low-yield group, the amount of para-isomer produced is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n*   The nitro group (`-NO2`) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups, leading to the lowest para-yield.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester (`-COOC2H5`) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nWithin this high-yield group, the order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, with the low-yield meta-directors preceding the high-yield ortho, para-directors, we arrive at the final sequence.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 6: Match the Final Order with the Given Options**\nThe derived chemically correct sequence is `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`.

A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower para-yield. I will order them from lowest to highest para-yield.\n\n3.  **Order the Ortho, Para-Directors:** Within the high-yield group, the order is determined by factors that increase the para-to-ortho product ratio, primarily steric hindrance and electronic effects. I will order them from lowest to highest para-yield.\n\n4.  **Combine and Finalize:** I will combine the two ordered groups to get the final sequence.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that assigns representative para-yield percentages to each substance based on these chemical principles.

This determines whether the incoming bromine electrophile will be directed to the meta position (resulting in a low para-yield) or to the ortho and para positions (resulting in a high para-yield).\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (Low para-yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups (High para-yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with the meta-directors (4, 6, 2) and end with the ortho, para-directors (1, 5, 3).\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para-Yield Group)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group; a stronger deactivating group directs more exclusively to the meta position, resulting in an even lower para-yield.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups, leading to the lowest para-yield.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is more deactivating than the ester group (-COOC₂H₅) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of their deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para-Yield Group)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary factor is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more likely site for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a special case. While it is deactivating overall, its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (typically ~87-90%) is higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the low-yield meta-directors before the high-yield ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Match with the Provided Options**\nComparing the derived sequence with the given choices:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe chemically correct sequence, `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Core Principles**\nThe task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) is the same for a given starting material, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The yield is determined by the directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first step is to classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This separates the compounds into two groups with vastly different para-isomer yields.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.

The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must have the meta-directors (4, 6, 2) at the beginning (lowest yields) and the ortho, para-directors (1, 5, 3) at the end (highest yields).\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group; a stronger deactivating group directs more exclusively to the meta position, resulting in an even lower para-yield.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO₂`) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester group (`-COOC₂H₅`) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of their deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) in substance 5 is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`) in substance 1. This increased steric hindrance near the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) will have a higher para-isomer yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) in substance 3 is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (~87-90%) is typically higher than for both toluene (~33%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the low-yield meta-directors before the high-yield ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 6: Match with the Provided Options**\nComparing the derived sequence with the given choices:\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nThe chemically correct sequence, `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses and established chemical principles.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe core task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of **increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer** formed during an electrophilic bromination reaction. As correctly noted by all candidate answers, since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting substance is identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\n### **Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe most critical step is to classify the substituents based on their directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This creates two distinct groups with vastly different yields of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitro group)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Carboxylic acid group)\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ester group)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Methyl group)\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethyl group)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chloro group)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with the meta-directors {4, 6, 2} and end with the ortho, para-directors {1, 5, 3}.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para-Yield)**\n\nWithin the group of meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A more powerful deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para and ortho isomers.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO2`) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester (`-COOC2H5`) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing character.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para-Yield)**\n\nWithin the group of ortho, para-directors, the order depends on the factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance (Comparing 1 and 5):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic and Steric Effects (Comparing with 3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is a deactivating but strongly para-directing substituent. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is experimentally known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the two ordered subgroups, we arrive at the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 6: Match with the Given Options**\n\nComparing the derived sequence with the provided choices:\n*   A) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n*   B) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n*   C) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n*   D) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nThe chemically correct sequence `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3` perfectly matches option A. The analysis presented in the candidate answers is unanimously correct in its chemical reasoning, even though many failed to match their result to the correct option letter.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers for a given starting material is identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. Therefore, the task is to order the substances by increasing percentage yield of the para-product.\n\n**Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe most critical factor determining the para-isomer yield is the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring. We can separate the substances into two distinct groups:\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield)**\n    These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer is very low.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   *Conclusion*: These three substances will have the lowest para-yields and will appear at the beginning of the final sequence.\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield)**\n    These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n    *   *Conclusion*: These three substances will have the highest para-yields and will appear at the end of the final sequence.\n\nBased on this grouping, the final order must be of the form: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor this group, the para-isomer yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, which results in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is more deactivating than the ester group (-COOC₂H₅) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor this group, the order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (-Cl) is highly para-directing. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high yield of the para-isomer, which is typically higher than that for simple alkylbenzenes like toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Combining these factors, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the low-yield meta-directors before the high-yield ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, final order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses and chemical principles.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of **increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer** formed during electrophilic bromination.

This allows us to separate the substances into two distinct categories.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, making the para-isomer a major product.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial grouping establishes that the final sequence must begin with substances {4, 6, 2} and end with substances {1, 5, 3}. This immediately eliminates options C and D.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nWithin this low-yield group, the amount of para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO2`) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is slightly more deactivating than the ester (`-COOC2H5`) because the electron-donating ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing effect.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nWithin this high-yield group, the order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance (Comparing 1 and 5):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more likely site for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic and Steric Effects (Comparing with 3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is highly para-directing. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene in bromination (~87%) is higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy concatenating the two ordered groups, we obtain the final sequence from the lowest to the highest para-isomer yield.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 6: Match with the Given Options**\nThe derived sequence is `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`.

The vast majority of the candidate answers arrived at this same chemical sequence, even if some mapped it to an incorrect letter. The chemical reasoning is sound and consistent.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first and most important step is to classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This separates the compounds into two distinct groups based on their expected para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must have the meta-directors (4, 6, 2) at the beginning (lowest yields), followed by the ortho, para-directors (1, 5, 3) at the end (highest yields). The overall structure of the answer must be: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para-Yield Group)**\nFor meta-directors, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group—a stronger deactivating group directs more exclusively to the meta position, resulting in an even lower para yield.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO₂` > `-COOH` > `-COOC₂H₅`.\n    *   The `-NO₂` group is one of the strongest deactivators, leading to the lowest para yield.\n    *   The `-COOH` group is more deactivating than the `-COOC₂H₅` group because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is the reverse of their deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para-Yield Group)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) in substance 5 is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`) in substance 1. This increased steric hindrance near the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) will have a higher para-isomer yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) in substance 3 is strongly ortho, para-directing. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (~89%) is typically higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**5. Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the low-yield meta-directors before the high-yield ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**6. Match with the Provided Options**\nComparing the derived sequence with the given choices:\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nThe chemically correct sequence, `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`, perfectly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe goal is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of **increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer** formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molecular weight of the monobrominated products (ortho, meta, para) is the same for any given starting material, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Consensus Reasoning**\n\nA review of all 15 candidate answers reveals a strong and unanimous consensus on the underlying chemical principles and the logical steps to solve the problem. The analysis can be broken down into three main parts.\n\n**Part A: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nAll agents correctly separate the substances into two groups:\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis establishes that the final sequence must be of the form `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**Part B: Order the Meta-Directors**\nAll agents correctly reason that for meta-directors, the para-yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivator is more selective for the meta position, producing an even lower para-yield.\n*   The consensus order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Part C: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors**\nAll agents correctly reason that for ortho, para-directors, the order depends on factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution, primarily steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`), so it blocks the ortho positions more effectively. This leads to a higher para-yield for ethylbenzene (5) than for toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing due to its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect, which deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This results in a very high para-yield, greater than that for both toluene and ethylbenzene. The order is **5 < 3**.\n*   Combining these gives the order for this group: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 3: Synthesize the Final Order and Match to Options**\n\nCombining the results from the two groups gives the final, complete sequence for increasing para-isomer yield.\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n*   **Final Combined Order:** **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nNow, we match this consensus-derived sequence to the given options:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe derived sequence **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3** perfectly matches option **C**.\n\n**Note on Candidate Errors:** While the chemical reasoning across all 15 candidates was unanimously correct, many of them failed in the final step of matching their derived sequence to the correct letter option, leading to a variety of incorrect final answers (A, B, D). The analysis of the core reasoning, however, points unambiguously to C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Core Chemical Principles**\n\nThe question asks to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molar mass of all monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe key factors determining the yield of the para-isomer are:\n1.  **Directing Effect:** Substituents are either *ortho, para-directing* or *meta-directing*. Meta-directors will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer, while ortho, para-directors will produce a high yield.\n2.  **Deactivating Strength:** For meta-directors, a stronger deactivating group leads to a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n3.  **Steric and Electronic Effects:** For ortho, para-directors, factors like steric hindrance and the electronic nature of the substituent influence the ratio of para to ortho product.\n\n### **Step 2: Classify the Substituents and Group the Substances**\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent and group the substances accordingly.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-directors (Low para-yield)**\n    These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-**NO₂** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-**COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-**COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, para-directors (High para-yield)**\n    These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-**CH₃** (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-**C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-**Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial grouping tells us that the final order must be `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Meta-Directors (Group 1)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the para-yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is slightly more deactivating than the ester group (-COOC₂H₅) because the electron-donating ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing effect.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n    *   **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n### **Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Group 2)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield depends on the ratio of para to ortho product, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the ortho positions, making the para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene has a higher para-yield than toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is highly para-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric hindrance, results in a very high para-yield (typically ~87-89%), which is generally higher than that for alkylbenzenes like toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the complete order for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### **Step 5: Combine the Orders for the Final Sequence**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final arrangement from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### **Step 6: Match with the Given Options**\n\nComparing the derived sequence with the provided choices:\nA) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThe correct sequence, **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**, matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal and Core Principles**\n\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molar mass of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe key factors determining the yield of the para-isomer are:\n1.  **Directing Effect:** Substituents are either *meta-directing* or *ortho, para-directing*. Meta-directors produce a very low yield of the para-isomer, while ortho, para-directors produce a high yield.\n2.  **Steric and Electronic Effects:** For ortho, para-directors, factors like the size of the substituent (steric hindrance) and its electronic properties influence the ratio of para to ortho product.\n\n### **Step 2: Classify the Substituents and Group the Substances**\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent and group the substances accordingly. This creates a broad initial order.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-directors (Low para-yield)**\n    These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-**NO₂** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-**COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-**COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   *Conclusion:* This group will form the beginning of our ordered list (lowest para-yield).\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, para-directors (High para-yield)**\n    These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-**CH₃** (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-**C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-**Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n    *   *Conclusion:* This group will form the end of our ordered list (highest para-yield).\n\nThe final order must have the structure: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Group 1)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the para-yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO₂`) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester group (`-COOC₂H₅`) because the electron-donating alkyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing effect.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength.\n*   **Order for Group 1:** `4 < 6 < 2`\n\n### **Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Group 2)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield depends on the ratio of para to ortho product, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary factor is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1).\n    *   Order: `1 < 5`\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (`-Cl`) is highly para-directing. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high para-to-ortho ratio. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (typically ~87-89%) is significantly higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n    *   **Order for Group 2:** `1 < 5 < 3`\n\n### **Step 5: Combine the Orders for the Final Sequence**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final arrangement from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### **Step 6: Match with the Given Options**\n\nComparing the derived sequence with the provided choices:\nA) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThe correct sequence, `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`, matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to arrange the six given benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during an electrophilic bromination reaction. Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers for a given starting substance is identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**2. Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first and most critical step is to classify each substituent based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This divides the compounds into two distinct groups based on their expected para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Isomer Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer is very low.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Isomer Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with the meta-directors (substances 4, 6, and 2) and end with the ortho, para-directors (substances 1, 5, and 3).\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor this group, the para-isomer yield is minimal. The yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent; a stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups due to strong inductive and resonance electron withdrawal.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is more deactivating than the ester group (-COOC₂H₅) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing strength.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor this group, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The primary factor is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more likely site for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a special case. While it is deactivating overall, its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**5. Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy concatenating the two ordered groups, we obtain the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the final answer, a systematic analysis of the chemical principles governing electrophilic aromatic substitution is required. The weight fraction of the para-isomer is directly proportional to its percentage yield.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe first step is to separate the substances into two groups based on the directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring. This is the most significant factor determining the yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with substances 4, 6, and 2, and end with substances 1, 5, and 3. The overall structure of the answer will be: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor this group, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO₂`) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester group (`-COOC₂H₅`) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor this group, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The primary factor is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more likely site for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the two ordered subgroups, we obtain the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the final answer, a systematic analysis of the chemical principles governing electrophilic aromatic substitution is required. The task is to arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during bromination. Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers for a given starting material is identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first and most important step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring. This determines whether the incoming bromine atom is directed primarily to the meta position (resulting in a low para-yield) or to the ortho and para positions (resulting in a high para-yield).\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with substances 4, 6, and 2, and end with substances 1, 5, and 3.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group; a stronger deactivating group directs more selectively to the meta position, resulting in an even lower para-yield.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups due to strong inductive and resonance electron withdrawal.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is slightly more deactivating than the ester group (-COOC₂H₅) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of their deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) in substance 5 is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃) in substance 1. This increased steric hindrance near the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) will have a higher para-isomer yield than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (-Cl) in substance 3 is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, with the low-yield meta-directors preceding the high-yield ortho,para-directors, we arrive at the final sequence.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho,para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Match with the Provided Options**\nComparing the derived sequence with the given choices:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThe chemically correct sequence, `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",
