The key steps are:\n1.  Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.\n2.  React the strong acid and strong base first.\n3.  React any remaining strong acid or strong base with the weak species (weak acid or weak base).\n4.  Determine the composition of the final solution.\n5.  Calculate the pH based on the dominant species. If excess strong acid or strong base remains, the pH is determined directly from its concentration. If a buffer solution (weak acid and its conjugate base) is formed, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used.\n\nMy initial calculation followed this exact procedure. The pKa of acetic acid is confirmed to be around 4.75-4.8. However, this value was not needed because the strong base, Ba(OH)2, was in excess after reacting with both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH3COOH). The final pH is therefore determined by the concentration of the excess hydroxide ions.\n\nLet's re-verify the numbers one last time.\n*   **Moles of H+ (total from acids):**\n    *   From HCl (strong): 0.400 L * 0.2 M = 0.080 mol H+\n    *   From CH3COOH (weak): 0.500 L * 0.1 M = 0.050 mol CH3COOH\n*   **Moles of OH- (from strong base):**\n    *   From Ba(OH)2: 0.300 L * 0.3 M = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)2\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- ions: 0.090 mol * 2 = 0.180 mol OH-\n\n*   **Neutralization:**\n    *   The 0.180 mol of OH- will first neutralize the 0.080 mol of H+ from the strong acid HCl.\n    *   OH- remaining = 0.180 - 0.080 = 0.100 mol\n    *   Next, the remaining OH- will neutralize the 0.050 mol of the weak acid CH3COOH.\n    *   OH- remaining = 0.100 - 0.050 = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Final Solution:**\n    *   The final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH- ions.\n    *   Total volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Final [OH-]:**\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n*   **pOH and pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe calculation is robust and the methodology is confirmed by the search results. The answer is 12.62.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 1.38 (This is the pOH)\nB) 8.68\nC) 12.62 (This matches the calculation)\nD) 8.92\n\nThe calculation is correct.\n\nTo determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the number of moles of acid and base.\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each substance:**\n    *   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n    *   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n        Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n    *   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n        Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that releases two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻), the moles of OH⁻ are:\n        Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n2.  **Perform the neutralization reactions:**\n    The strong base (OH⁻) will react completely with all available acid, starting with the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) first, and then the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n    *   **Reaction with strong acid (HCl):**\n        The 0.180 moles of OH⁻ will first neutralize the 0.080 moles of H⁺ from HCl.\n        Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n    *   **Reaction with weak acid (CH3COOH):**\n        The remaining 0.100 moles of OH⁻ will then react with the 0.050 moles of CH3COOH.\n        Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH of the final solution:**\n    After all reactions, there are 0.050 moles of excess OH⁻ ions in the solution. The pH will be determined by this excess strong base.\n\n    *   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n        Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n    *   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n        [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n        [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n    *   **Calculate the pOH:**\n        pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n        pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n    *   **Calculate the pH:**\n        The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n        pH = 14 - pOH\n        pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nTherefore, the pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the number of moles of the acidic and basic species and then determine which, if any, is in excess after neutralization.\n\n**1.

The solution path involves a stoichiometry calculation to determine which component is in excess after neutralization.\n\n1.  First, I will calculate the number of moles of each substance.\n2.  Then, I will determine the total moles of H+ ions (from both the strong and weak acids) and the total moles of OH- ions (from the strong base).\n3.  I will then perform a neutralization reaction to find the moles of the excess species (either H+ or OH-).\n4.  Next, I will calculate the total volume of the final solution.\n5.  Using the moles of the excess species and the total volume, I will find the final concentration.\n6.  Finally, I will calculate the pH from this concentration.\n\nThis is a standard chemistry calculation that does not require an external search. I will perform the calculation.\n\n**Skeptic:** Your approach is sound, but there are a few points to be careful about.\n1.  **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)2:** Did you remember that one mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH- ions? This is a common point of error.\n2.  **Weak vs. Strong Acid:** You are combining the moles of H+ from a strong acid and a weak acid. While the strong base will react with both, it's conceptually clearer to react the strong acid (HCl) and strong base (Ba(OH)2) first, and then react any leftover strong species with the weak acid (CH3COOH). Does this change the final amount of excess OH-?\n3.  **Final Solution Composition:** After neutralization, the solution will contain excess strong base (OH-) and the conjugate base of the weak acid (CH3COO-). You are assuming the pH is determined solely by the excess strong base. Is the contribution to the overall [OH-] from the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (CH3COO-) truly negligible?\n\n**Proposer:**\n1.  **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)2:** Yes, I will use the fact that moles of OH- = 2 * moles of Ba(OH)2.\n2.  **Order of Reaction:** You are right, reacting the strong components first is the correct procedure. Let's check:\n    *   Moles H+ (from HCl) = 0.08 mol.\n    *   Moles OH- (from Ba(OH)2) = 0.18 mol.\n    *   After this first reaction, 0.10 mol of OH- remains.\n    *   Now, this remaining 0.10 mol of OH- reacts with the 0.05 mol of CH3COOH.\n    *   This leaves 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol of OH- in excess. This confirms the initial calculation was correct in its result, but this method is more rigorous.\n3.  **Final Solution Composition:** The final solution contains 0.05 mol of excess OH- (a strong base) in 1.2 L, giving [OH-] ≈ 0.042 M. It also contains 0.05 mol of acetate (a weak base). The presence of a high concentration of OH- from the strong base will suppress the hydrolysis of the weak acetate base (Le Châtelier's principle), making its contribution to the pH negligible. Therefore, calculating the pH based only on the excess strong base is the correct and standard method for this type of problem.\n\n**Decision:** The plan is robust.

Since moles of OH⁻ > total moles of acid, the strong base is in excess.\n\n3.  **Calculate Moles of Excess Base:**\n    *   Moles of excess OH⁻ = Total moles OH⁻ - Total moles acid\n    *   Moles of excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n4.  **Calculate Final Concentration of Excess OH⁻:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The final concentration must be calculated using the total combined volume.\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n5.  **Calculate pH:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The concentration of OH⁻ is used to find the pOH first.

The key steps are:\n1.  Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.\n2.  React the strong acid and strong base first.\n3.  React any remaining strong acid or strong base with the weak species (weak acid or weak base).\n4.  Determine the composition of the final solution.\n5.  Calculate the pH based on the dominant species. If excess strong acid or strong base remains, the pH is determined directly from its concentration. If a buffer solution (weak acid and its conjugate base) is formed, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used.\n\nMy initial calculation followed this exact procedure. The pKa of acetic acid is confirmed to be around 4.75-4.8. However, this value was not needed because the strong base, Ba(OH)2, was in excess after reacting with both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH3COOH).

Calculate the pOH and pH of the solution.**\n\n*   **pOH:** pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.\n*   **pH:** pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n**Proposer:** The problem asks for the pH of a mixture of a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The solution path involves a stoichiometry calculation to determine which component is in excess after neutralization.\n\n1.  First, I will calculate the number of moles of each substance.\n2.  Then, I will determine the total moles of H+ ions (from both the strong and weak acids) and the total moles of OH- ions (from the strong base).\n3.  I will then perform a neutralization reaction to find the moles of the excess species (either H+ or OH-).\n4.  Next, I will calculate the total volume of the final solution.\n5.  Using the moles of the excess species and the total volume, I will find the final concentration.\n6.  Finally, I will calculate the pH from this concentration.\n\nThis is a standard chemistry calculation that does not require an external search. I will perform the calculation.\n\n**Skeptic:** Your approach is sound, but there are a few points to be careful about.\n1.  **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)2:** Did you remember that one mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH- ions? This is a common point of error.\n2.  **Weak vs. Strong Acid:** You are combining the moles of H+ from a strong acid and a weak acid. While the strong base will react with both, it's conceptually clearer to react the strong acid (HCl) and strong base (Ba(OH)2) first, and then react any leftover strong species with the weak acid (CH3COOH). Does this change the final amount of excess OH-?\n3.  **Final Solution Composition:** After neutralization, the solution will contain excess strong base (OH-) and the conjugate base of the weak acid (CH3COO-). You are assuming the pH is determined solely by the excess strong base. Is the contribution to the overall [OH-] from the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (CH3COO-) truly negligible?\n\n**Proposer:**\n1.  **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)2:** Yes, I will use the fact that moles of OH- = 2 * moles of Ba(OH)2.\n2.  **Order of Reaction:** You are right, reacting the strong components first is the correct procedure. Let's check:\n    *   Moles H+ (from HCl) = 0.08 mol.\n    *   Moles OH- (from Ba(OH)2) = 0.18 mol.\n    *   After this first reaction, 0.10 mol of OH- remains.\n    *   Now, this remaining 0.10 mol of OH- reacts with the 0.05 mol of CH3COOH.\n    *   This leaves 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol of OH- in excess. This confirms the initial calculation was correct in its result, but this method is more rigorous.\n3.  **Final Solution Composition:** The final solution contains 0.05 mol of excess OH- (a strong base) in 1.2 L, giving [OH-] ≈ 0.042 M. It also contains 0.05 mol of acetate (a weak base). The presence of a high concentration of OH- from the strong base will suppress the hydrolysis of the weak acetate base (Le Châtelier's principle), making its contribution to the pH negligible. Therefore, calculating the pH based only on the excess strong base is the correct and standard method for this type of problem.\n\n**Decision:** The plan is robust. I will proceed with the calculation without needing an external search.\n\n***\n\n### **Calculation Steps**\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of each species:**\n    *   **CH3COOH (weak acid):** 0.500 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n    *   **HCl (strong acid):** 0.400 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol of H+\n    *   **Ba(OH)2 (strong base):** 0.300 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol of Ba(OH)2. Since Ba(OH)2 provides two OH- ions, the moles of OH- are 2 * 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol of OH-.\n\n2.  **Perform the neutralization reactions:**\n    *   First, the strong acid (HCl) reacts with the strong base (Ba(OH)2).\n        *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol (initial OH-) - 0.080 mol (H+ from HCl) = 0.100 mol OH-\n    *   Next, the remaining strong base (OH-) reacts with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n        *   Moles of OH- in excess = 0.100 mol (remaining OH-) - 0.050 mol (CH3COOH) = 0.050 mol OH-\n\n3.  **Calculate the final concentration of the excess OH-:**\n    *   **Total Volume:** 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n    *   **[OH-] concentration:** 0.050 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n4.  **Calculate the pOH and pH:**\n    *   **pOH:** -log[OH-] = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   **pH:** 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe calculated pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
