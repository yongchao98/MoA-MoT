These potentials describe the complete, relativistically correct, time-varying electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion. They are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the finite speed of light, meaning the fields observed at a time `t` are generated by the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`.\n\nThe scalar potential V at position $\\vec{r}$ and time t is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nThis can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by c:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe vector potential $\\vec{A}$ at position $\\vec{r}$ and time t is given by:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nSimilarly, this can be rewritten as:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions for V and $\\vec{A}$ are related by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$.\n\nComparing these standard forms with the given options:\n*   Option A is incorrect due to the plus sign in the denominator.\n*   Options B and C use the static Coulomb potential for V, which is incorrect as it does not account for the motion of the charge and the retarded time.\n*   Option D correctly matches the derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials for both the scalar and vector potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the complete, relativistically correct electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe scalar potential $V(\\vec{r}, t)$ and the vector potential $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t)$ at a specific point in space $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ are determined by the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time, $t_r$. This retarded time is when the electromagnetic field, traveling at the speed of light $c$, must have been emitted from the charge to reach the observer at time $t$.\n\nThe standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{ret}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q c \\vec{\\beta}}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{ret}$\n\nHere, the subscript \"ret\" signifies that all terms inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. Let's translate these terms into the notation given in the question:\n*   $R$ is the distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point. In the problem's notation, this is the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d}$, so $R = d$.\n*   $\\vec{n}$ is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position to the observation point, which is $\\vec{d}/d$.\n*   $\\vec{\\beta}$ is the velocity of the charge divided by the speed of light, $\\vec{v}/c$.\n\nSubstituting these into the denominator term $R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})$ gives:\n$d \\left(1 - \\dfrac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c}\\right) = d \\left(1 - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}\\right) = d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nNow, we can write the potentials using the problem's notation.\n\nFor the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{\\left( \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} \\right)} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc(\\vec{v}/c)}{\\left( \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} \\right)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q \\vec{v}}{\\left( \\dfrac{4\\pi(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}{c} \\right)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese derived expressions match option A. The negative sign in the denominator is crucial and arises from the time derivative of the retarded time, accounting for the fact that the distance the signal has to travel is changing as the source moves.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nLet's define the key quantities based on the problem description:\n*   `q`: The charge of the point particle.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t)$: The position vector of the charge as a function of time, representing its trajectory.\n*   $\\vec{r}$: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n*   $t$: The time at which the fields are observed at $\\vec{r}$.\n*   $t_r$: The retarded time, which is the time at which the signal (electromagnetic field) was emitted from the charge to reach point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$: The distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t)}{dt}\\Big|_{t=t_r}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $c$: The speed of light in vacuum.\n\nThe relationship between the observation time $t$ and the retarded time $t_r$ is given by the fact that the signal travels the distance $d$ at the speed of light $c$:\n$t = t_r + \\frac{d}{c} \\implies t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for a moving point charge. They are derived from the general formulas for retarded potentials:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nFor a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ are given by:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals and performing the integration (a standard but non-trivial derivation in electromagnetism) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key step involves accounting for the fact that the volume element of the moving charge appears compressed due to the retardation effect. This introduces a factor of $1/(1 - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / (dc))$ in the potentials.\n\nThe resulting expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nTo match the format of the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match option C.\n\nLet's briefly analyze the other options:\n*   A) and D) present the static Coulomb potential form for V, which is incorrect for a moving charge as it neglects the retardation effect. Also, in A), the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is a scalar, which is incorrect.\n*   B) has a plus sign in the denominator ($dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$). This would correspond to the \"advanced potentials,\" which are solutions to Maxwell's equations but are generally discarded as they violate causality (effects preceding causes). The correct retarded potentials have a minus sign.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option C. It's also worth noting that for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$, which can be verified using the expressions from option C and the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\epsilon_0 \\mu_0)$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Scenario:** We are asked to find the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) at a specific point in space ($\\vec{r}$) and time (t) due to a point charge (q) moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$. This is a classic problem in electrodynamics, and the solutions are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n2.  **Recall the Concept of Retarded Time:** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, c. Therefore, the field observed at point $\\vec{r}$ at time t is not caused by the charge's state at time t, but by its state at an earlier time, called the **retarded time**, $t_r$. The signal emitted from the charge's position at $t_r$, which is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, must travel a distance $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time t. This relationship is given by:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n    Using the notation from the problem statement, where $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ and $d = |\\vec{d}|$, this becomes:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\n3.  **Start with the General Formulas for Retarded Potentials:** The potentials for any time-varying charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by the retarded potential integrals:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$.\n\n4.  **Apply to a Point Charge:** For a point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities are represented by Dirac delta functions:\n    *   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    *   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integrals (The Careful Point):** Substituting these densities into the potential integrals is not straightforward because the retarded time $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A careful evaluation (often done by changing variables or using properties of delta functions) yields a correction factor. This factor accounts for the \"compression\" or \"stretching\" of the apparent volume of the charge due to its motion relative to the observer (a relativistic Doppler-like effect).\n\n    The result of this integration is:\n    $\\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}} \\right]_{t'=t_r}$\n\n6.  **Write Down the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** Using the notation from the problem statement ($\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$, $d=|\\vec{d}|$, $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$), the expressions become:\n\n    *   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})}$\n        Multiplying the numerator and denominator by c gives:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n    *   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n        The derivation is identical, but with the current density $q\\vec{v}$ instead of the charge density $q$.\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})}$\n        Multiplying the numerator and denominator by c gives:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) Incorrect. These are quasi-static approximations, not the general solution.\n    *   B) Incorrect. The form of the vector potential is wrong.\n    *   C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        This option perfectly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   D) Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. The correct sign is negative, which means the potential is larger when the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which are given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which are the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n**1. Starting Point: Retarded Potentials**\n\nThe scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A` at a position `r` and time `t` generated by a charge distribution `ρ(r', t')` and current distribution `J(r', t')` are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nwhere `tr` is the retarded time, defined by the condition that the signal emitted at `tr` from position `r'` reaches `r` at time `t`:\n$t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$\n\n**2. Charge and Current Densities for a Point Charge**\n\nFor a single point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nwhere `v(t') = ds(t')/dt'` is the velocity of the charge at time `t'`.\n\n**3. Substituting into the Potential Integrals**\n\nLet's substitute these densities into the potential formulas. The integration is over the source coordinates `r'`. The delta function `δ³(r' - s(tr))` means the integrand is only non-zero when `r' = s(tr)`. However, the retarded time `tr` itself depends on `r'`. This makes the direct evaluation of the integral tricky.\n\nA more formal approach is to use the general integral solution involving the Green's function for the wave equation:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\iint \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} \\delta\\left(t' - \\left(t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}\\right)\\right) d^3r' dt'$\n\nSubstitute the charge density for the point charge:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\iint \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} \\delta\\left(t' - \\left(t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}\\right)\\right) d^3r' dt'$\n\nFirst, perform the spatial integral over `d³r'`. The `δ³` function collapses the integral, setting `r' = s(t')`:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\delta\\left(t' - \\left(t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}{c}\\right)\\right) dt'$\n\n**4. Evaluating the Time Integral**\n\nNow we need to evaluate the integral over `t'`. We use the property of the Dirac delta function:\n$\\int f(x) \\delta(g(x)) dx = \\sum_i \\frac{f(x_i)}{|g'(x_i)|}$, where `g(x_i) = 0`.\n\nIn our case, the variables are:\n- `x` is `t'`\n- `f(t') = 1 / |r - s(t')|`\n- `g(t') = t' - t + |r - s(t')| / c`\n\nThe root of `g(t') = 0` is the retarded time `tr`, which satisfies `tr - t + |r - s(tr)| / c = 0`. This is the definition of `tr`. Let's use the notation from the problem statement:\n- `d = r - s(tr)` is the vector from the retarded position to the observation point.\n- `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|` is the distance.\n- `v = v(tr)` is the velocity at the retarded time.\n\nSo the root is `t' = tr`. Now we need to compute the derivative `g'(t')` and evaluate it at `t' = tr`.\n\n$g'(t') = \\frac{d}{dt'} \\left( t' - t + \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}{c} \\right) = 1 + \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{d}{dt'} |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|$\n\nLet's compute the derivative of the distance term:\n$\\frac{d}{dt'} |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')| = \\frac{d}{dt'} \\sqrt{(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t'))}$\n$= \\frac{1}{2|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\cdot 2(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot (-\\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'})$\n$= -\\frac{(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}$\n\nEvaluating at `t' = tr`:\n$\\left. \\frac{d}{dt'} |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')| \\right|_{t'=t_r} = -\\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d}$\n\nNow substitute this back into the expression for `g'(tr)`:\n$g'(t_r) = 1 + \\frac{1}{c} \\left( -\\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d} \\right) = 1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{cd} = \\frac{cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{cd}$\n\nSince `|v| < c`, the term `(d ⋅ v) / (cd)` is less than 1, so `g'(tr)` is positive and we don't need the absolute value.\n\n**5. Final Expression for the Potentials**\n\nNow we can find the scalar potential `V`:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{f(t_r)}{g'(t_r)}$\n$f(t_r) = \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|} = \\frac{1}{d}$\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1/d}{(cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}) / (cd)} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{cd}{d(cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe calculation for the vector potential `A` is identical, except the function `f(t')` is `v(t') / |r - s(t')|`.\n$f(t_r) = \\frac{\\vec{v}(t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{d}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\frac{f(t_r)}{g'(t_r)} = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\vec{v}/d}{(cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}) / (cd)} = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\vec{v}cd}{d(cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**6. Comparing with the Options**\n\nThe derived expressions are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match option B exactly.\n\n- Option A has a `+` sign, which would correspond to advanced potentials (violating causality in this context).\n- Option C uses the wrong distance `r` and misses the relativistic correction factor in the denominator.\n- Option D has the same error for `V` as C and a dimensionally incorrect formula for `A`.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. Background: Retarded Potentials\n\nFor a general time-varying charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$, the scalar and vector potentials at a field point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ are given by:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nHere, $t_r$ is the **retarded time**, which is the time at which the signal (electromagnetic field) must have been emitted from the source point $\\vec{r}'$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$. The signal travels at the speed of light, $c$. Thus, the retarded time is defined by the implicit equation:\n\n$t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$\n\n### 2. Applying to a Moving Point Charge\n\nFor a single point charge $q$ with a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, we can express the charge and current densities using Dirac delta functions:\n\n*   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\nSubstituting these into the potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe main difficulty in evaluating these integrals is that the retarded time $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Integrals\n\nTo solve the integral, we can change the integration variable from space ($\\vec{r}'$) to time ($t'$). The integral effectively picks out the contribution from the charge at the unique retarded time $t_r$ when it was at position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n\nA standard derivation (which involves evaluating the integral with the delta function whose argument depends on the integration variable) yields the following result. The volume element $d^3r'$ gets transformed in a way that introduces a correction factor. The effective volume occupied by the charge appears compressed or expanded to the observer due to its motion (a Doppler-like effect).\n\nThe result of the integration is:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nWhere all quantities in the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$:\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the field point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the distance from the charge's retarded position to the field point.\n*   The retarded time $t_r$ is determined by the condition $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n\n### 4. Final Expressions\n\nLet's rewrite the potentials to match the format of the options. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nThese expressions are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\n\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This exactly matches our derived result.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect. It uses the static potential form and ignores the crucial retardation effect in the denominator, which depends on the velocity.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This is incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. A '+' sign would correspond to advanced potentials (effects preceding their cause), which are typically discarded as unphysical.\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect for the same reason as B, and the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also dimensionally and structurally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework\n\nThe electric and magnetic fields, and thus the scalar and vector potentials, are governed by Maxwell's equations. For time-varying sources, these lead to wave equations for the potentials V and A:\n\n*   $∇²V - \\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\dfrac{∂²V}{∂t²} = -\\dfrac{ρ}{\\epsilon_o}$\n*   $∇²\\vec{A} - \\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\dfrac{∂²\\vec{A}}{∂t²} = -μ_o\\vec{J}$\n\nwhere ρ is the charge density and J is the current density.\n\nThe solutions to these equations are the \"retarded potentials,\" which means the potential at a field point `(r, t)` is determined by the state of the source at an earlier time, the \"retarded time\" `tr`. The delay `t - tr` is exactly the time it takes for a light signal to travel from the source to the field point.\n\n### 2. Defining the Source and Retarded Time\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities are:\n\n*   Charge density: $ρ(\\vec{r'}, t') = q δ³(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') δ³(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'$.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is defined by the condition that light emitted from the charge at position `s(tr)` at time `tr` reaches the observer at position `r` at time `t`.\n\n*   $t - tr = \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|}{c}$\n\nLet's use the notation given in the problem:\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the field point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|$.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(tr)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\nThe retarded time condition becomes: $c(t - tr) = d$.\n\n### 3. Deriving the Potentials\n\nThe general solutions for the retarded potentials are given by integrals over the source distributions:\n\n*   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{ρ(\\vec{r'}, tr)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d³r'$\n*   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{μ_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, tr)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d³r'$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for a point charge, we get:\n\n*   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{δ³(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d³r'$\n*   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{μ_o q}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{v}(tr) δ³(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d³r'$\n\nThe evaluation of these integrals is a standard but non-trivial procedure in electrodynamics. The dependence of the retarded time `tr` on the integration variable `r'` inside the delta function requires careful treatment. The result of this integration yields a correction factor in the denominator.\n\nThe result of the integration is:\n$\\int \\dfrac{δ³(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d³r' = \\left[ \\dfrac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}(tr) \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr))}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|})} \\right]_{tr}$\n\nUsing the problem's notation (`d`, `d`, `v`):\nThe integral evaluates to: $\\dfrac{1}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd})} = \\dfrac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}} = \\dfrac{c}{cd - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}$\n\n### 4. Final Expressions for V and A\n\nNow, we substitute this result back into the expressions for V and A.\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{c}{cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right]$\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**Vector Potential (A):**\nFor the vector potential, the velocity `v(tr)` is evaluated at the retarded time and can be treated as a constant during the spatial integration.\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{μ_o q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{c}{cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right]$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{μ_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 5.

This is the static potential. While the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for V is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option B provides the correct formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge, which are described by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

Substituting the problem's notation:\n    $d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}\\right) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n5.  **Rewrite the potentials:**\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n6.  **Match to the options:**\n    The options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. We can achieve this form by multiplying the numerator and denominator of our expressions by $c$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n7.  **Compare:**\n    These expressions exactly match option D.

These potentials account for the fact that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` depends on the state of the charge at an earlier \"retarded\" time, `tr`.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is defined implicitly by the equation $t - t_r = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| / c$, which simplifies to $t - t_r = d/c$, where `d` is the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d}$.\n\nThe correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations.

This is the time at which the electromagnetic field must have been generated by the charge to reach the observer at the later time $t$.\n\nThe derivation of these potentials involves integrating the retarded potentials for a continuous charge and current distribution, specialized to the case of a point charge. A key part of the derivation involves a factor that accounts for the change in the effective volume of the charge distribution due to its motion relative to the observer.\n\nThe standard expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n\nThe scalar potential V is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nAnd the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is given by:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nHere, all the quantities in the brackets on the right-hand side are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.

This is a standard problem in electrodynamics, and the solution is given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. I will perform a search to find the standard expressions for these potentials and then match them to the given options, paying close attention to the notation defined in the prompt.\n\n**Skeptic**: The notation is critical here. We have $\\vec{d}$ as the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$, and $\\vec{v}$ is the charge's velocity at $t_r$. The options differ primarily in the denominator, specifically the sign of the $\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ term. A simple search might give the formula in a different notation, so careful translation will be necessary. We must confirm the exact form of the denominator, which accounts for the fact that the distance the field information has to travel depends on the charge's motion.\n\n**Decision**: The next action will be to search for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials and their derivation to ensure the correct form of the denominator.\n\n**Proposer**: The search results confirm that the potentials for a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Result provides the scalar potential in a notation very similar to the problem's. It gives the scalar potential as $\\phi(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r| - \\vec{\\beta} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r)}$, where $\\vec{r}_r$ is the retarded position and $\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{v}_r/c$.\n\n**Skeptic**: Let's carefully translate this to the notation given in the question.\n*   The vector from the retarded position to the observation point, $\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r$, is what the problem calls $\\vec{d}$.\n*   The magnitude $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r|$ is therefore $d$.\n*   The velocity at the retarded time, $\\vec{v}_r$, is what the problem calls $\\vec{v}$.\n*   So, $\\vec{\\beta}$ is $\\vec{v}/c$.\n\nSubstituting these into the formula from the search result:\nThe denominator is $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r| - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r) = d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}$.\nThis can be rewritten as $\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$.\n\nSo the scalar potential is $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$.\n\nThis matches the scalar potential in option B.\n\n**Proposer**: Now for the vector potential, $\\vec{A}$. It is well-established that for a single moving point charge, the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential $V$ by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. Let's apply this to the scalar potential we just found.\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$.\n\nUsing the relation $c^2 = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_o \\mu_o}$, we can write $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_o c} = \\mu_o c$.\nSubstituting this in, we get:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o c q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$.\n\nThis expression for $\\vec{A}$ matches the one in option B.\n\n**Skeptic**: The derivation seems sound and the translation of notation is correct. The key was identifying the correct form of the denominator, which includes the negative sign. The relationship between $\\vec{A}$ and $V$ is also correctly applied. Both parts of option B have been derived from the standard Liénard-Wiechert potential formulas found in the search results. The other options are incorrect due to either using a static potential form or having the wrong sign in the denominator.\n\n**Conclusion**: The debate converges.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nLet's define the key quantities based on the problem description:\n*   `q`: The charge of the point particle.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t)$: The position vector of the charge as a function of time, representing its trajectory.\n*   $\\vec{r}$: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n*   $t$: The time at which the fields are observed at $\\vec{r}$.\n*   $t_r$: The retarded time, which is the time at which the signal (electromagnetic field) was emitted from the charge to reach point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$: The distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t)}{dt}\\Big|_{t=t_r}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $c$: The speed of light in vacuum.\n\nThe relationship between the observation time $t$ and the retarded time $t_r$ is given by the fact that the signal travels the distance $d$ at the speed of light $c$:\n$t = t_r + \\frac{d}{c} \\implies t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for a moving point charge. They are derived from the general formulas for retarded potentials:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nFor a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ are given by:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals and performing the integration (a standard but non-trivial derivation in electromagnetism) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key step involves accounting for the fact that the volume element of the moving charge appears compressed due to the retardation effect. This introduces a factor of $1/(1 - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / (dc))$ in the potentials.\n\nThe resulting expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nTo match the format of the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match option C.\n\nLet's briefly analyze the other options:\n*   A) and D) present the static Coulomb potential form for V, which is incorrect for a moving charge as it neglects the retardation effect. Also, in A), the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is a scalar, which is incorrect.\n*   B) has a plus sign in the denominator ($dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$). This would correspond to the \"advanced potentials,\" which are solutions to Maxwell's equations but are generally discarded as they violate causality (effects preceding causes). The correct retarded potentials have a minus sign.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option C. It's also worth noting that for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$, which can be verified using the expressions from option C and the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\epsilon_0 \\mu_0)$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Scenario:** We are asked to find the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) at a specific point in space ($\\vec{r}$) and time (t) due to a point charge (q) moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$. This is a classic problem in electrodynamics, and the solutions are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n2.  **Recall the Concept of Retarded Time:** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, c. Therefore, the field observed at point $\\vec{r}$ at time t is not caused by the charge's state at time t, but by its state at an earlier time, called the **retarded time**, $t_r$. The signal emitted from the charge's position at $t_r$, which is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, must travel a distance $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time t. This relationship is given by:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n    Using the notation from the problem statement, where $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ and $d = |\\vec{d}|$, this becomes:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\n3.  **Start with the General Formulas for Retarded Potentials:** The potentials for any time-varying charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by the retarded potential integrals:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$.\n\n4.  **Apply to a Point Charge:** For a point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities are represented by Dirac delta functions:\n    *   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    *   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integrals (The Careful Point):** Substituting these densities into the potential integrals is not straightforward because the retarded time $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A careful evaluation (often done by changing variables or using properties of delta functions) yields a correction factor. This factor accounts for the \"compression\" or \"stretching\" of the apparent volume of the charge due to its motion relative to the observer (a relativistic Doppler-like effect).\n\n    The result of this integration is:\n    $\\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}} \\right]_{t'=t_r}$\n\n6.  **Write Down the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** Using the notation from the problem statement ($\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$, $d=|\\vec{d}|$, $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$), the expressions become:\n\n    *   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})}$\n        Multiplying the numerator and denominator by c gives:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n    *   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n        The derivation is identical, but with the current density $q\\vec{v}$ instead of the charge density $q$.\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})}$\n        Multiplying the numerator and denominator by c gives:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) Incorrect. These are quasi-static approximations, not the general solution.\n    *   B) Incorrect. The form of the vector potential is wrong.\n    *   C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        This option perfectly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   D) Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. The correct sign is negative, which means the potential is larger when the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which are given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which are the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n**1. Starting Point: Retarded Potentials**\n\nThe scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A` at a position `r` and time `t` generated by a charge distribution `ρ(r', t')` and current distribution `J(r', t')` are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nwhere `tr` is the retarded time, defined by the condition that the signal emitted at `tr` from position `r'` reaches `r` at time `t`:\n$t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$\n\n**2. Charge and Current Densities for a Point Charge**\n\nFor a single point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nwhere `v(t') = ds(t')/dt'` is the velocity of the charge at time `t'`.\n\n**3. Substituting into the Potential Integrals**\n\nLet's substitute these densities into the potential formulas. The integration is over the source coordinates `r'`. The delta function `δ³(r' - s(tr))` means the integrand is only non-zero when `r' = s(tr)`. However, the retarded time `tr` itself depends on `r'`. This makes the direct evaluation of the integral tricky.\n\nA more formal approach is to use the general integral solution involving the Green's function for the wave equation:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\iint \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} \\delta\\left(t' - \\left(t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}\\right)\\right) d^3r' dt'$\n\nSubstitute the charge density for the point charge:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\iint \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} \\delta\\left(t' - \\left(t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}\\right)\\right) d^3r' dt'$\n\nFirst, perform the spatial integral over `d³r'`. The `δ³` function collapses the integral, setting `r' = s(t')`:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\delta\\left(t' - \\left(t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}{c}\\right)\\right) dt'$\n\n**4. Evaluating the Time Integral**\n\nNow we need to evaluate the integral over `t'`. We use the property of the Dirac delta function:\n$\\int f(x) \\delta(g(x)) dx = \\sum_i \\frac{f(x_i)}{|g'(x_i)|}$, where `g(x_i) = 0`.\n\nIn our case, the variables are:\n- `x` is `t'`\n- `f(t') = 1 / |r - s(t')|`\n- `g(t') = t' - t + |r - s(t')| / c`\n\nThe root of `g(t') = 0` is the retarded time `tr`, which satisfies `tr - t + |r - s(tr)| / c = 0`. This is the definition of `tr`. Let's use the notation from the problem statement:\n- `d = r - s(tr)` is the vector from the retarded position to the observation point.\n- `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|` is the distance.\n- `v = v(tr)` is the velocity at the retarded time.\n\nSo the root is `t' = tr`. Now we need to compute the derivative `g'(t')` and evaluate it at `t' = tr`.\n\n$g'(t') = \\frac{d}{dt'} \\left( t' - t + \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}{c} \\right) = 1 + \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{d}{dt'} |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|$\n\nLet's compute the derivative of the distance term:\n$\\frac{d}{dt'} |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')| = \\frac{d}{dt'} \\sqrt{(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t'))}$\n$= \\frac{1}{2|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\cdot 2(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot (-\\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'})$\n$= -\\frac{(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}$\n\nEvaluating at `t' = tr`:\n$\\left. \\frac{d}{dt'} |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')| \\right|_{t'=t_r} = -\\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d}$\n\nNow substitute this back into the expression for `g'(tr)`:\n$g'(t_r) = 1 + \\frac{1}{c} \\left( -\\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d} \\right) = 1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{cd} = \\frac{cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{cd}$\n\nSince `|v| < c`, the term `(d ⋅ v) / (cd)` is less than 1, so `g'(tr)` is positive and we don't need the absolute value.\n\n**5. Final Expression for the Potentials**\n\nNow we can find the scalar potential `V`:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{f(t_r)}{g'(t_r)}$\n$f(t_r) = \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|} = \\frac{1}{d}$\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1/d}{(cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}) / (cd)} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{cd}{d(cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe calculation for the vector potential `A` is identical, except the function `f(t')` is `v(t') / |r - s(t')|`.\n$f(t_r) = \\frac{\\vec{v}(t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{d}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\frac{f(t_r)}{g'(t_r)} = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\vec{v}/d}{(cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}) / (cd)} = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\vec{v}cd}{d(cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**6. Comparing with the Options**\n\nThe derived expressions are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match option B exactly.\n\n- Option A has a `+` sign, which would correspond to advanced potentials (violating causality in this context).\n- Option C uses the wrong distance `r` and misses the relativistic correction factor in the denominator.\n- Option D has the same error for `V` as C and a dimensionally incorrect formula for `A`.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. Background: Retarded Potentials\n\nFor a general time-varying charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$, the scalar and vector potentials at a field point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ are given by:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nHere, $t_r$ is the **retarded time**, which is the time at which the signal (electromagnetic field) must have been emitted from the source point $\\vec{r}'$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$. The signal travels at the speed of light, $c$. Thus, the retarded time is defined by the implicit equation:\n\n$t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$\n\n### 2. Applying to a Moving Point Charge\n\nFor a single point charge $q$ with a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, we can express the charge and current densities using Dirac delta functions:\n\n*   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\nSubstituting these into the potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe main difficulty in evaluating these integrals is that the retarded time $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Integrals\n\nTo solve the integral, we can change the integration variable from space ($\\vec{r}'$) to time ($t'$). The integral effectively picks out the contribution from the charge at the unique retarded time $t_r$ when it was at position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n\nA standard derivation (which involves evaluating the integral with the delta function whose argument depends on the integration variable) yields the following result. The volume element $d^3r'$ gets transformed in a way that introduces a correction factor. The effective volume occupied by the charge appears compressed or expanded to the observer due to its motion (a Doppler-like effect).\n\nThe result of the integration is:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nWhere all quantities in the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$:\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the field point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the distance from the charge's retarded position to the field point.\n*   The retarded time $t_r$ is determined by the condition $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n\n### 4. Final Expressions\n\nLet's rewrite the potentials to match the format of the options. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nThese expressions are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 5.

The sign in the denominator is wrong.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework\n\nThe electric and magnetic fields, and thus the scalar and vector potentials, are governed by Maxwell's equations. For time-varying sources, these lead to wave equations for the potentials V and A:\n\n*   $∇²V - \\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\dfrac{∂²V}{∂t²} = -\\dfrac{ρ}{\\epsilon_o}$\n*   $∇²\\vec{A} - \\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\dfrac{∂²\\vec{A}}{∂t²} = -μ_o\\vec{J}$\n\nwhere ρ is the charge density and J is the current density.\n\nThe solutions to these equations are the \"retarded potentials,\" which means the potential at a field point `(r, t)` is determined by the state of the source at an earlier time, the \"retarded time\" `tr`. The delay `t - tr` is exactly the time it takes for a light signal to travel from the source to the field point.\n\n### 2. Defining the Source and Retarded Time\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities are:\n\n*   Charge density: $ρ(\\vec{r'}, t') = q δ³(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') δ³(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'$.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is defined by the condition that light emitted from the charge at position `s(tr)` at time `tr` reaches the observer at position `r` at time `t`.\n\n*   $t - tr = \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|}{c}$\n\nLet's use the notation given in the problem:\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the field point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|$.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(tr)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\nThe retarded time condition becomes: $c(t - tr) = d$.\n\n### 3. Deriving the Potentials\n\nThe general solutions for the retarded potentials are given by integrals over the source distributions:\n\n*   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{ρ(\\vec{r'}, tr)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d³r'$\n*   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{μ_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, tr)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d³r'$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for a point charge, we get:\n\n*   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{δ³(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d³r'$\n*   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{μ_o q}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{v}(tr) δ³(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d³r'$\n\nThe evaluation of these integrals is a standard but non-trivial procedure in electrodynamics. The dependence of the retarded time `tr` on the integration variable `r'` inside the delta function requires careful treatment. The result of this integration yields a correction factor in the denominator.\n\nThe result of the integration is:\n$\\int \\dfrac{δ³(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d³r' = \\left[ \\dfrac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}(tr) \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr))}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|})} \\right]_{tr}$\n\nUsing the problem's notation (`d`, `d`, `v`):\nThe integral evaluates to: $\\dfrac{1}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd})} = \\dfrac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}} = \\dfrac{c}{cd - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}$\n\n### 4. Final Expressions for V and A\n\nNow, we substitute this result back into the expressions for V and A.\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{c}{cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right]$\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**Vector Potential (A):**\nFor the vector potential, the velocity `v(tr)` is evaluated at the retarded time and can be treated as a constant during the spatial integration.\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{μ_o q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{c}{cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right]$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{μ_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 5.

This would correspond to advanced potentials, which are not physically realized.\n*   **D)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ - Incorrect. This is the static potential. While the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for V is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option B provides the correct formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge, which are described by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key is to recognize the standard formulas and match them to the given notation.\n\n1.  **Identify the core physics:** The problem describes a classic scenario in electromagnetism: finding the potentials of a moving point charge, accounting for the finite speed of light (retardation). The solutions are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n2.  **Recall/Derive the Liénard-Wiechert formulas:**\n    The scalar potential ($V$ or $\\phi$) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) are given by:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n\n3.  **Translate to the problem's notation:**\n    *   The vector from the retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d}$. In the standard formula, this is $\\vec{R}$.\n    *   The magnitude of this vector is $d$. In the standard formula, this is $R$.\n    *   The unit vector $\\vec{n}$ is therefore $\\vec{d}/d$.\n    *   The velocity of the charge is $\\vec{v}$.\n    *   The normalized velocity $\\vec{\\beta}$ is $\\vec{v}/c$.\n\n4.  **Substitute and simplify the denominator:**\n    The crucial term in the denominator is $R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})$. Substituting the problem's notation:\n    $d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}\\right) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n5.  **Rewrite the potentials:**\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n6.  **Match to the options:**\n    The options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. We can achieve this form by multiplying the numerator and denominator of our expressions by $c$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n7.  **Compare:**\n    These expressions exactly match option D. The negative sign in the denominator is characteristic of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials and accounts for the Doppler-like effect of the moving source.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the fact that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` depends on the state of the charge at an earlier \"retarded\" time, `tr`.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is defined implicitly by the equation $t - t_r = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| / c$, which simplifies to $t - t_r = d/c$, where `d` is the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d}$.\n\nThe correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\nThis can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nThe vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential `V` by the expression $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$. Applying this relationship, we get:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right)$\n\nUsing the identity $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, we can simplify the expression for the vector potential:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}}{1} \\left( \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nComparing these derived expressions with the given options, we find that option D matches both the scalar and vector potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the electromagnetic field generated by a point charge in arbitrary motion, taking into account the finite speed of light, `c`.\n\nThe key concept is that the fields observed at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` are determined by the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`. This retarded time is earlier than `t` by the amount of time it takes for the signal to travel from the charge's position to the observation point.\n\nLet:\n*   `q` be the charge.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ be the position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$ be the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{r}$ be the observation point.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ be the vector from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ be the magnitude of this vector.\n*   The retarded time is defined by the relation $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations.

The vector $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$, and $\\vec{v}$ is the charge's velocity at $t_r$.\n\nTo match the format of the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator inside the brackets by $c$:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential, we can use the relationship $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. Applying this to the expression for V:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c^2 (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nUsing the relation $c^2 = \\frac{1}{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o}$, we get $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_o c^2} = \\mu_o$. Substituting this in:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions for $V(\\vec{r},t)$ and $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t)$ match exactly with option A.\n\n*   Option B has the wrong sign in the denominator, which would correspond to an \"advanced\" potential that violates causality.\n*   Option C uses the static Coulomb potential for V, which is incorrect as it does not account for the motion of the charge and the retardation effect in the denominator.\n*   Option D also uses the incorrect static potential and has an incorrect form for the vector potential.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n**Proposer**: The problem asks for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge. This is a standard problem in electrodynamics, and the solution is given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. I will perform a search to find the standard expressions for these potentials and then match them to the given options, paying close attention to the notation defined in the prompt.\n\n**Skeptic**: The notation is critical here. We have $\\vec{d}$ as the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$, and $\\vec{v}$ is the charge's velocity at $t_r$. The options differ primarily in the denominator, specifically the sign of the $\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ term. A simple search might give the formula in a different notation, so careful translation will be necessary. We must confirm the exact form of the denominator, which accounts for the fact that the distance the field information has to travel depends on the charge's motion.\n\n**Decision**: The next action will be to search for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials and their derivation to ensure the correct form of the denominator.\n\n**Proposer**: The search results confirm that the potentials for a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Result provides the scalar potential in a notation very similar to the problem's. It gives the scalar potential as $\\phi(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r| - \\vec{\\beta} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r)}$, where $\\vec{r}_r$ is the retarded position and $\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{v}_r/c$.\n\n**Skeptic**: Let's carefully translate this to the notation given in the question.\n*   The vector from the retarded position to the observation point, $\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r$, is what the problem calls $\\vec{d}$.\n*   The magnitude $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r|$ is therefore $d$.\n*   The velocity at the retarded time, $\\vec{v}_r$, is what the problem calls $\\vec{v}$.\n*   So, $\\vec{\\beta}$ is $\\vec{v}/c$.\n\nSubstituting these into the formula from the search result:\nThe denominator is $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r| - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r) = d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}$.\nThis can be rewritten as $\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$.\n\nSo the scalar potential is $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$.\n\nThis matches the scalar potential in option B.\n\n**Proposer**: Now for the vector potential, $\\vec{A}$. It is well-established that for a single moving point charge, the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential $V$ by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. Let's apply this to the scalar potential we just found.\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$.\n\nUsing the relation $c^2 = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_o \\mu_o}$, we can write $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_o c} = \\mu_o c$.\nSubstituting this in, we get:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o c q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$.\n\nThis expression for $\\vec{A}$ matches the one in option B.\n\n**Skeptic**: The derivation seems sound and the translation of notation is correct. The key was identifying the correct form of the denominator, which includes the negative sign. The relationship between $\\vec{A}$ and $V$ is also correctly applied. Both parts of option B have been derived from the standard Liénard-Wiechert potential formulas found in the search results. The other options are incorrect due to either using a static potential form or having the wrong sign in the denominator.\n\n**Conclusion**: The debate converges. Option B correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials in the given notation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
