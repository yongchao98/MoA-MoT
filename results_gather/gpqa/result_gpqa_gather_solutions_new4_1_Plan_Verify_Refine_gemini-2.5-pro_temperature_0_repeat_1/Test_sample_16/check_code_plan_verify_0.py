        K_d = 1 / K_f

    # The equilibrium expression is K_d = x^2 / (initial_conc - x)
    # Since K_d is very small, we assume x << initial_conc, so K_d â‰ˆ x^2 / initial_conc
    # x = sqrt(K_d * initial_conc)
    calculated_x_squared = K_d * initial_complex_conc

    # The assumption is valid if x is much smaller than the initial concentration.

    # Step 4: Compare the calculated result with the selected answer
    # We use math.isclose() to handle potential floating-point inaccuracies and rounding in the option.
    # A relative tolerance of 2% is reasonable for this type of problem.
