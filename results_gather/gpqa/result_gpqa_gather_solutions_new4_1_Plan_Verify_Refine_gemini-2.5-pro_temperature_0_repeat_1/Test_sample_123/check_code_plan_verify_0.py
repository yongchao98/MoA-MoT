    # --- Physics Derivation ---
    # The fraction of surviving particles 'f' is given by:
    # f = exp(-R / (gamma * c * tau))
    # where R is distance, gamma is Lorentz factor, c is speed of light, tau is proper lifetime.
    # The term R / (c * tau) is a constant for the experiment. Let's call it K.
    # f = exp(-K / gamma)
    # Taking the natural log: ln(f) = -K / gamma
    # Rearranging: K = -gamma * ln(f) = gamma * ln(1/f)
    # Since K is constant for both scenarios:
    # gamma_1 * ln(1/f1) = gamma_2 * ln(1/f2)
    # Solving for gamma_2:
    # gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(1/f1) / ln(1/f2)

    # --- Verification ---
    # The question asks for the Lorentz factor needed for "about" two-thirds of particles to reach the wall.
    # The options are integers. The most reasonable check is to see if the candidate answer is the closest integer
    # to the calculated result.
