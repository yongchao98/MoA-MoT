def check_answer_correctness():

    Checks the correctness of the answer to a genomics data analysis question.

    The function encodes the reasoning from the provided analysis into a data structure.
    It evaluates each potential source of error based on two criteria from the question:
    1. Is it a "common" source of error?
    2. Does it lead to "difficult-to-spot" erroneous results?

    The final answer is then compared against the set of issues that satisfy both criteria.
