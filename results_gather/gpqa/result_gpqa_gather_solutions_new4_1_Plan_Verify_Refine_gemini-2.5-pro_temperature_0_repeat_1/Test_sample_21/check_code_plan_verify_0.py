    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the electrochemistry question.

    The function verifies two key points:
    1.  Thermodynamics: Is oxygen a weaker or stronger oxidant in basic solutions?
    2.  Kinetics: Does oxygen react slower or faster in acidic solutions?

    It then compares the derived correct option with the LLM's provided answer.

    # --- Part 1: Thermodynamic Analysis ---
    # The strength of an oxidant is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°).
    # A higher (more positive) E° indicates a stronger oxidant.
    # We compare the potential in basic solution to the potential in acidic solution.
