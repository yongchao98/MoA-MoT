    # --- Problem Definition & Provided Answer ---
    # The question describes a 3-step synthesis and asks for an NMR feature of the final product.
    # The options are: A) doublet of triplets, B) triplet of triplets, C) pentet, D) triplet.
    
    # The final answer from the LLM to be checked.

    # --- Step-by-step Chemical Deduction ---

    # Step 1: Identify Product 1
    # Reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + excess KOH, 240°C.
    # Analysis: Harsh basic conditions on a rigid cage suggest a skeletal rearrangement.
    # The IR data (1720 cm⁻¹, ketone) and known chemistry point to a rearranged isomer.
    # Conclusion: Product 1 is protoadamantan-4-one.
    product_1 = "protoadamantan-4-one"

    # Step 2: Identify Product 2
    # Reaction: Product 1 (ketone) + excess aluminum isopropoxide, heat.
    # Analysis: The subsequent step is ozonolysis, which requires a C=C double bond.
    # This implies a one-pot sequence:
    #   1. Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of the ketone to an alcohol.
    #   2. Dehydration of the alcohol under heat to form an alkene.
    # Conclusion: Product 2 is protoadamant-4-ene.
    product_2 = "protoadamant-4-ene"

    # Step 3: Identify Product 3
    # Reaction: Product 2 (alkene) + O3, then DMS.
    # Analysis: Reductive ozonolysis cleaves the C=C bond. In protoadamant-4-ene, this
    # opens one of the rings to form a larger bicyclic system with two ketone groups.
    # Conclusion: Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.
    product_3 = "bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione"

    # Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3
    # 4a. Identify the most deshielded proton:
    # In the symmetrical bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione, the two equivalent bridgehead
    # protons (at C1 and C5) are in a unique, constrained environment and are influenced
    # by two nearby ketone groups. They are the most likely candidates for being the
    # most deshielded non-exchangeable protons.
    most_deshielded_proton = "Bridgehead proton (H1/H5)"

    # 4b. Determine the coupling pattern:
    # The bridgehead proton (e.g., H1) is coupled to its vicinal neighbors.
    # Neighbors: Protons on C2 and C8. (Coupling to the C9 bridge is often negligible).
    # Symmetry: The molecule has C2v symmetry. The two protons on C2 are equivalent to the two on C8.
    # Within each CH2 group, the axial and equatorial protons are different.
    # Therefore, H1 is coupled to two sets of equivalent protons:
    #   - Set 1: Two equivalent axial protons (H2-ax, H8-ax) with coupling constant J_ax.
    #   - Set 2: Two equivalent equatorial protons (H2-eq, H8-eq) with coupling constant J_eq.
    # Applying the n+1 rule for multiple couplings:
    #   - Coupling to the two axial protons (n=2) gives a triplet.
    #   - Each line of this triplet is further split by the two equatorial protons (n=2) into another triplet.
    # Conclusion: The resulting pattern is a "triplet of triplets".
    derived_pattern = "triplet of triplets"
    derived_key = "B"
