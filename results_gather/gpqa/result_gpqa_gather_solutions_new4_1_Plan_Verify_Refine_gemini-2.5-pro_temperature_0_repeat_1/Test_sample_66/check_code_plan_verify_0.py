    Checks the correctness of the answer to the quantum mechanics problem.

    The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring m1=-1 and m2=-1
    for a system in the coupled state |l=2, m=-1>.

    The core principle is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum,
    which translates to the selection rule m = m1 + m2 for the Clebsch-Gordan
    coefficients. The probability is the square of this coefficient.
