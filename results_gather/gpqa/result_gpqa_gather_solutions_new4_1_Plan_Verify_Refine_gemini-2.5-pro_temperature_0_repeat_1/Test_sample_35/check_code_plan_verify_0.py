    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the astrophysics question.
    It follows these steps:
    1.  Calculates the cosmological redshift (z) from the given distance.
    2.  Calculates the rest-frame energy of the observed absorption line.
    3.  Compares the calculated energy to the known energy of the 21-cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI).
    4.  Verifies that the chosen answer correctly identifies the interstellar medium component traced by a 21-cm absorption line.
