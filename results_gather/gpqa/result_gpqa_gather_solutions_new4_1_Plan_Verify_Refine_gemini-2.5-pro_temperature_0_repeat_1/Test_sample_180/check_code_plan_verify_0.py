    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer by modeling the physics of the problem.

    The problem asks for the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV)
    after the pp-III branch (source of 8B neutrinos) has stopped.

    The remaining sources are:
    - 7Be neutrinos (from pp-II branch): A strong mono-energetic line at 861 keV.
    - CNO neutrinos: A continuous spectrum covering both bands.

    # --- Step 1: Define the physical model based on the problem statement ---
    # Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV) comes only from the CNO cycle.
    # Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV) comes from the 7Be line and the CNO cycle.
    # The pp-III (8B) flux is zero.

    # --- Step 2: Use standard solar model / experimental data for flux values ---
    # These values are consistent with the reasoning in the provided answers and scientific literature.
    # All fluxes are in units of neutrinos / (cm^2 * s).

    # Flux of the 7Be line at 861 keV. This is a major component of the solar neutrino flux.

    # Flux from the CNO cycle. The total CNO flux is ~5-7e8, spread over ~1.7 MeV.

    flux_cno_band1 = flux_cno_per_band

    # --- Step 3: Calculate the total flux in each band under the hypothetical scenario ---

    # We check if the LLM's chosen option is the closest one to our calculated value.
