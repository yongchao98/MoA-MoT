def check_answer_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer provided for the nuclear decay problem.

    The problem asks to compare the energy spectrum of particle 'E' in two decays:
    1. Original: 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V
    2. Variant:  2A -> 2B + 2E + M (M is massless, V has mass)

    The options are:
    A) The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.
    B) The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.
    C) The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.
    D) The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.

    The provided final answer from the analysis is 'C'. This function will verify that logic.

    # A decay spectrum is continuous if there are 3 or more particles in the final state.
    # The variant decay is 2A -> 2B + 2E + M.
    # The final state has 5 particles (2 heavy B, 2 light E, 1 light M).
    # Since 5 > 2, the energy is shared statistically, and the spectrum must remain continuous.

                "Since this is a multi-body decay (more than 2 final particles), the energy is shared, "

    # --- Step 2: Analyze the endpoint of the spectrum (Increase vs. Decrease) ---
    # The endpoint is determined by the Q-value of the reaction: Q_value = (m_initial - m_final) * c^2.
    # A larger Q-value means a higher endpoint.
    # We need to compare the total rest mass of the final products. A smaller final rest mass means a larger Q-value.
    
    # Let's compare the mass of the light particles created (since 2A, 2B, and 2E are common to both Q-value calculations).
    # Mass of light products in original decay = 2 * mass(V)
    # Mass of light products in variant decay = mass(M)
    
    # We are given that M is massless (mass(M) = 0) and V is a "lighter particle", which implies it has a real, non-zero mass (mass(V) > 0).
    # Therefore, 2 * mass(V) > mass(M).
    
    # The total rest mass of the final products is smaller in the variant decay.
    # This means more mass is converted to energy, so the Q-value is larger for the variant decay.
    # A larger Q-value means the endpoint of the spectrum increases.
