    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the Feynman diagram loop question.

    The core logic is based on the principle from quantum field theory that in
    four-dimensional spacetime, each loop (L) in a Feynman diagram contributes
    a factor of 1/(4pi)^2 to the amplitude. Therefore, L loops contribute a
    factor of (1/(4pi)^2)^L = 1/(4pi)^(2L).

    The given expression contains the factor 1/(4pi)^6.
    By equating the exponents, we get 2L = 6, which means L = 3.

    The options are:
    A) 6
    B) 1
    C) 2
    D) 3

    The correct number of loops is 3, which corresponds to option D.
    This function will verify if the provided final answer is <<<D>>>.

    # The final answer provided by the LLM that is being checked.
    final_answer_text = """
Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.

**1. Identify the Core Physical Principle**

The fundamental task is to relate the mathematical expression to a physical property of the Feynman diagram, specifically its number of loops (`L`). In quantum field theory calculations performed in four-dimensional spacetime, there is a standard relationship between the number of loops and a characteristic factor that appears in the final amplitude. Each loop integration over an unconstrained internal momentum contributes a factor of `1/(4π)²`. Therefore, a diagram with `L` loops will contain a factor of `(1/(4π)²)^L`, which simplifies to `1/(4π)^(2L)`.

**2. Apply the Principle to the Given Expression**

The expression provided is: `alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`.

We must isolate the loop factor, which is `1/(4pi)^6`. We can now set up an equation by comparing this to the general form:

`1/(4π)^(2L) = 1/(4π)^6`

For this equality to hold, the exponents must be equal:

`2L = 6`

Solving for `L` gives:

`L = 3`

The calculation unambiguously shows that the Feynman diagram must have contained 3 loops.

**3. Analyze the Candidate Answers**

A review of the provided candidate answers reveals a crucial pattern:
*   **Unanimous Reasoning:** Nearly every candidate answer that provides a derivation (Answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17) correctly identifies the `1/(4π)²` per loop rule and correctly calculates `L=3`.
*   **Inconsistent Final Choices:** Despite the correct reasoning, a majority of the answers select a final letter that contradicts their own derivation. For example, Answer 1 derives `L=3` but concludes with `<<<B>>>` (1 loop). Answer 2 derives `L=3` but concludes with `<<<C>>>` (2 loops).
*   **Consistent Answers:** Only a few answers are internally consistent. Answers 3, 6, and 12 all correctly derive `L=3` and correctly conclude with `<<<D>>>`, which corresponds to 3 loops. Answer 13 also provides `<<<D>>>` without reasoning.

**4. Conclusion**

The correct answer must be based on the sound physical reasoning that is agreed upon by almost all the provided analyses. The inconsistencies in the final letter choices of most candidates appear to be errors. The correct calculation `L=3` corresponds to option D.
