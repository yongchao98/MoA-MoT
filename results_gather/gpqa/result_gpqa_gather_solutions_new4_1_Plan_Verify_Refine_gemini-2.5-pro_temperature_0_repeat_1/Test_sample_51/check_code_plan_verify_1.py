    This is a multi-step physics problem that requires careful application of the Boltzmann equation. I will first outline my plan, verify the core calculation, and then analyze the provided answers to reach a final decision.

    **Plan:**
    *   Analyze the candidate answers to find the consensus on the calculation method and the numerical result.
    *   Identify any discrepancies in the final selected option (A, B, C, D) despite similar calculations.
    *   Perform my own calculation to verify the numerical result.
    *   Synthesize the findings to determine the most reliable answer.

    I will now execute the calculation to establish a ground truth for the numerical factor.

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    # Define physical constants
    h = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant in J·s
    c = 2.99792458e8    # Speed of light in m/s
    k = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant in J/K

    # Define the given parameters from the problem
    T_nospots = 6000.0  # Temperature without spots in Kelvin
    T_spots = 5500.0    # Temperature with spots in Kelvin
    wavelength = 1448e-10 # Wavelength in meters (1448 Å)

    # The factor is given by F = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]
    # where ΔE = hc/λ
    # So, F = exp[ (hc / (λk)) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]

    exponent = ((h * c) / (wavelength * k)) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots)
    factor = np.exp(exponent)

    print(f"The calculated factor is: {factor:.3f}")
    ```
    The calculation confirms that the numerical factor is approximately 4.506. Now I will analyze the candidate answers in light of this result.

    ### Step-by-step Analysis

    1.  **Core Physics Principle**: The problem requires the use of the Boltzmann equation to find the ratio of atomic populations at two different temperatures. The factor is the ratio of these two population ratios:
        `Factor = Ratio(T=6000K) / Ratio(T=5500K)`
        This simplifies to:
        `Factor = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]`
        where `ΔE = hc/λ`. Almost all candidate answers correctly identify and apply this formula.

    2.  **Calculation**: The inputs are `T_nospots = 6000 K`, `T_spots = 5500 K`, and `λ = 1448 Å`. My own calculation, as well as the calculations in the vast majority of the candidate answers (e.g., Answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17), yields a numerical result of **~4.51**. There is a strong consensus on this value.

    3.  **Analysis of Candidate Answers**:
        *   **Correct Calculation, Correct Answer**: Answers 3, 5, 16, and 17 all correctly calculate the factor to be ~4.5 and correctly map this to option **A**.
        *   **Correct Calculation, Incorrect Answer**: A large number of answers (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14) correctly calculate the factor to be ~4.5 but then select an incorrect option (B, C, or D). This indicates a flaw in their final step of matching the result to the provided options. For example, Answer 1 calculates 4.51 but chooses D (~1.1). Answer 7 calculates 4.506 but chooses B (~7.8).
        *   **No Calculation/Reasoning**: Answer 12 provides an answer without any justification.

    4.  **Conclusion**: The physical reasoning and mathematical calculation are consistent across nearly all solutions, leading to a factor of approximately 4.5. The discrepancies arise from a failure in some agents to correctly associate this numerical result with the corresponding option letter. The agents that perform the entire process correctly (calculation and selection) unanimously arrive at option A.

    Therefore, the factor by which the ratio changes is ~4.5.
