def check_chip_seq_answer(final_answer_str: str):
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to a complex ChIP-seq question.

    The function simulates the reasoning process by:
    1. Defining the key experimental and biological facts.
    2. Formulating the two main competing hypotheses that explain the observation.
    3. Weighing the hypotheses based on specificity and biological context.
    4. Comparing the provided answer to the most logical conclusion.

    Args:
        final_answer_str: The final answer provided, e.g., "<<<B>>>".

    Returns:
        "Correct" if the answer is correct, or a string explaining the error.

The strong PFA+DSG crosslinking makes these already-dense regions insoluble. Insoluble chromatin is pelleted and discarded during the ChIP protocol, leading to a loss of signal from these specific regions.",

    # While epitope masking (Hypothesis A) is a plausible general explanation, the insolubility of
    # IKAROS-bound heterochromatin (Hypothesis B) is a more specific and compelling explanation
    # because it directly incorporates the known, unique binding properties of IKAROS.
    # Therefore, Hypothesis B is considered the stronger explanation.

            f"The key is to integrate the experimental artifact with the specific biology of the IKAROS protein.\n\n"
            f"1. The 'Epitope Masking' theory (often leading to choice 'A' or 'C') suggests that the antibody is blocked at dense protein complexes like promoters/enhancers. While this is a possible artifact, it doesn't explain why a method designed to improve signal at these sites would cause a total loss.\n\n"
            f"2. The 'Insolubility at Repeats' theory (leading to choice 'B') is stronger. IKAROS is known to bind to dense, repetitive heterochromatin. The very strong PFA+DSG crosslinking would likely make these already-compact regions insoluble. Insoluble material is discarded during the ChIP experiment, which would cause the peaks at these specific repeat regions to 'disappear'.\n\n"
            f"Conclusion: This explanation is more specific and compelling because it directly links the observation to the known binding patterns of IKAROS."
