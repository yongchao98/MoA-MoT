    # --- Step 1: Deduction of the chemical identities ---

    # Clue: Melting point of B is very close to 277 K.
    # 277 K is 3.85 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D2O) is 3.82 °C.
    # This strongly indicates B is D2O.
    substance_B = 'D2O'

    # Clue: Gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.
    # Given the context of D2O, the heavier isotope is Deuterium (D).
    # A D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D2 molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.
    # This fits the clue perfectly.
    gas_W = 'D2'

    # Clue: Substance X contains a heavier isotope, its analog is a common organic reagent,
    # and its reaction with a keto acid (3 oxygens) yields a product with 2 oxygens.
    # This implies a strong reduction of both a ketone and a carboxylic acid to alcohols.
    # The common reagent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH4).
    # The deuterated analog is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4).
    substance_X = 'LiAlD4'

    # Verify all clues with X = LiAlD4
    # Reaction: LiAlD4 + 4D2O -> LiOD + Al(OD)3 + 4D2
    # - Violent reaction: Correct.
    # - Gas W = D2: Correct.
    # - Precipitate G = Al(OD)3: Correct (Al(OH)3 is a precipitate).
    # - Heating G releases B (D2O): Correct (2Al(OD)3 -> Al2O3 + 3D2O).
    # - B = D2O (melting point ~277K): Correct.
    # All deductions point to Substance X being LiAlD4.

    # --- Step 2: Perform the calculation ---

    # Question: Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.
    # X = LiAlD4. Elements are Li, Al, D (isotope of H).
    
    # Atomic numbers: H=1, Li=3, Al=13.
    # Lightest element is Hydrogen. Heaviest element is Aluminum.
    
    # Mass numbers for the specific isotopes:
    # Deuterium (D or ²H) has a mass number of 2.
    # Aluminum (²⁷Al) has a mass number of 27.
    
    # The formula LiAlD4 contains:
    # - 4 atoms of the lightest element (as Deuterium).
    # - 1 atom of the heaviest element (Aluminum).
    
    mass_from_lightest_element = 4 * 2  # 4 atoms of Deuterium
    mass_from_heaviest_element = 1 * 27 # 1 atom of Aluminum
    
    calculated_value = mass_from_lightest_element + mass_from_heaviest_element
    
    # --- Step 3: Check the provided answer ---
    
    # The provided final answer is 'A', which corresponds to the value 35.
    expected_value = 35
    provided_answer_letter = 'A'
    
    if calculated_value == expected_value:
        # The calculation is correct. Now check if the letter matches.
        options = {'A': 35, 'B': 29, 'C': 25, 'D': 31}
        if options.get(provided_answer_letter) == calculated_value:
            return "Correct"
        else:
            return f"Reason: The calculated value is {calculated_value}, but the provided answer letter '{provided_answer_letter}' corresponds to the value {options.get(provided_answer_letter)}."
    else:
        return f"Reason: The calculation is incorrect. The cumulative mass of the lightest (4*D=8) and heaviest (1*Al=27) elements in LiAlD4 is 8 + 27 = 35, but the calculated value was {calculated_value}."
