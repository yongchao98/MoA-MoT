def check_correctness_of_exoplanet_period():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the exoplanet orbital period problem.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  Define the known parameters from the question.
    2.  Establish the limiting condition for the second planet's transit. The maximum
        orbital period corresponds to the maximum semi-major axis, which in turn
        corresponds to the maximum impact parameter for a transit. The standard
        assumption is that the planet's center grazes the star's limb, so b_max = 1.
    3.  Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets using the
        ratio of their impact parameters (a2/a1 = b2/b1), since the inclination and
        stellar radius are constant for the system.
    4.  Use Kepler's Third Law (P² ∝ a³) to calculate the maximum period for the
        second planet (P2_max).
    5.  Compare the calculated numerical result to the provided options to find the
        best fit.
    6.  Check if the LLM's final answer matches the best-fitting option.
