    # --- Step 1: Identify Substance Z ---
    # Constraint: Z is a hydrocarbon with H mass fraction ~14.28% (1/7), saturated, and a common solvent.
    # The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n.
    # Mass fraction H = (2n * 1.008) / (12.011n + 2n * 1.008) = 2.016 / 14.027 â‰ˆ 0.1437
    # This is very close to 14.28%, confirming Z is a cycloalkane.
    # The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane.
    substance_z = {'name': 'cyclohexane', 'formula': 'C6H12', 'C_atoms': 6, 'H_atoms': 12}

    # --- Step 2: Deduce the Composition of Mixture Y ---
    # Constraint: Y is an equimolar mixture of Z and another liquid (Y_prime).
    # Constraint: Y does not decolorize bromine water.
    # Constraint: Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.
    # This implies Y_prime must hydrogenate to Z but be saturated or aromatic.
    # The only logical candidate is benzene.
    # Let's verify: Benzene (C6H6) is aromatic (doesn't decolorize Br2 water) and hydrogenates to cyclohexane.
    y_prime = {'name': 'benzene', 'formula': 'C6H6', 'C_atoms': 6, 'H_atoms': 6}
    mixture_y = [substance_z, y_prime]

    # --- Step 3: Use Atom Conservation to Analyze Mixture X ---
    # Constraint: Mixture X (A + B) undergoes disproportionation to Mixture Y (Z + Y_prime).
    # The reaction is A + B -> Z + Y_prime. Atoms must be conserved.
    total_h_in_y = mixture_y[0]['H_atoms'] + mixture_y[1]['H_atoms']
    total_c_in_y = mixture_y[0]['C_atoms'] + mixture_y[1]['C_atoms']

    # Therefore, the two molecules of mixture X must also have a total of `total_h_in_y` hydrogen atoms.
    calculated_total_h_in_x = total_h_in_y

    # --- Step 4: Verify the Identities of Components in Mixture X ---
    # This step confirms our calculation from atom conservation.
    # Constraint: A and B are C6 cyclic compounds (since they hydrogenate to Z).
    # Constraint: A and B are unsaturated (decolorize Br2 water).
    # Constraint: A and B have no conjugated bonds.
    # We need two C6Hn molecules whose hydrogens sum to `calculated_total_h_in_x`.
    # Candidates: Cyclohexene (C6H10, non-conjugated) and 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8, non-conjugated).
    # 1,3-Cyclohexadiene is ruled out because it is conjugated.
    component_a = {'name': 'cyclohexene', 'H_atoms': 10}
    component_b = {'name': '1,4-cyclohexadiene', 'H_atoms': 8}

    # The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.
    # The provided answer is D, which corresponds to 18.
