    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the chemistry problem.

    The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂],
    among all cobalt-containing species.

    The calculation is based on the mole fraction formula for complexation equilibria:
    αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)
    where n=2 for the target species.
