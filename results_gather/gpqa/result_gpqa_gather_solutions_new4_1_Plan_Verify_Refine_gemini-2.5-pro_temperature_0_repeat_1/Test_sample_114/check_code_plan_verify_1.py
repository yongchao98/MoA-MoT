    Checks the correctness of the answer to the electron-positron annihilation problem.

    The problem asks for the angle between two photons produced from an
    electron-positron annihilation, given their initial Lorentz factors.

    The derivation from conservation of energy and momentum gives the formula for
    the angle 'theta' of one photon with the horizontal axis:
    cos(theta) = (sqrt(gamma_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(gamma_p^2 - 1)) / (gamma_e + gamma_p)

    The angle between the two photons is 2 * theta.
