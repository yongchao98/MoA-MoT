Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion, E_π = m_πc². This energy is converted into the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\nE_π = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the initial momentum is zero, the final momenta of the muon (p_μ) and the neutrino (p_ν) must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\np_μ = p_ν = p\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is related to its rest mass (m) and momentum (p) by the equation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\nFor the muon: E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\nFor the massless neutrino: E_ν = pc\n\n**4. Calculation:**\nFrom the conservation of energy, we have E_μ = E_π - E_ν = m_πc² - pc.\n\nNow, we substitute this into the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nSimplifying the equation to solve for the momentum (p):\n(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)(pc)\np = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]c\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy of the neutrino:\nE_ν = pc = [(m_π)² - (m_μ)²]c² / [2(m_π)]\nE_ν = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\nE_ν = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / 279.2\nE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nSince the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy (KE_ν) is equal to its total energy.\n**KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\nNext, we find the total energy of the muon using the conservation of energy:\nE_μ = m_πc² - E_ν\nE_μ = 139.6 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 109.8 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ) is its total energy minus its rest mass energy.\nKE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²\nKE_μ = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV\n**KE_μ ≈ 4.1 MeV**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies for the muon and the neutrino are approximately 4.1 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. This matches one of the provided options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo find the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay of a stationary pion (π⁺), we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay process is:\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\nGiven:\n*   The pion (π⁺) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered massless (m_ν = 0).\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy:**\nSince the pion is at rest, its total energy is its rest mass energy. This energy is conserved and converted into the total energies of the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν).\nE_π = E_μ + E_ν\nm_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe initial momentum is zero because the pion is stationary. Therefore, the final momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must have equal magnitudes of momentum and travel in opposite directions.\np_μ = p_ν = p\n\n**3. Calculations:**\n\nFor the massless neutrino, its total energy is equal to its momentum multiplied by the speed of light (E_ν = p*c). This energy is entirely kinetic.\n\nFor the muon, its total energy is given by the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\nE_μ² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n\nFrom energy conservation, we can express the muon's total energy as:\nE_μ = m_π*c² - E_ν = m_π*c² - p*c\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the energy-momentum equation for the muon:\n(m_π*c² - p*c)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n(m_π*c²)² - 2(m_π*c²)(p*c) + (p*c)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n\nSolving for p*c (which is the neutrino's energy, E_ν):\nE_ν = p*c = [(m_π*c²)² - (m_μ*c²)²] / [2 * m_π*c²]\nE_ν = (139.6² - 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6)\nE_ν = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2\nE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately 29.8 MeV.\n\nNext, we find the total energy of the muon:\nE_μ = m_π*c² - E_ν\nE_μ = 139.6 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 109.8 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ) is its total energy minus its rest mass energy.\nKE_μ = E_μ - m_μ*c²\nKE_μ = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.1 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.

Let's call this magnitude $p$.\n    $p = |\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}| = |\\vec{p}_\\nu|$\n\n**3. Calculation of Kinetic Energies**\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2$.\n\n*   **For the neutrino:** Since it's massless, $E_\\nu = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0} = pc$. We also know $E_\\nu = KE_\\nu$.\n    So, $KE_\\nu = pc$.\n\n*   **For the muon:**\n    $E_{\\mu^+}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+} c^2)^2$\n    Substitute $pc = KE_\\nu$:\n    $E_{\\mu^+}^2 = (KE_\\nu)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+} c^2)^2$\n    Also, $E_{\\mu^+} = KE_{\\mu^+} + m_{\\mu^+} c^2$.\n    $(KE_{\\mu^+} + m_{\\mu^+} c^2)^2 = (KE_\\nu)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+} c^2)^2$\n\n*   **Solving the System:**\n    From the energy conservation step, we have $KE_\\nu = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - KE_{\\mu^+}$.

This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Decay**\n\n*   **The Process:** A stationary positive pion ($\\pi^+$) decays into a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu_{\\mu}$). The reaction is: $\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu_{\\mu}$.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** In any particle decay, both total energy and total momentum must be conserved. Since the initial pion is stationary, this is a two-body decay from rest.\n*   **Relativistic Kinematics:** The speeds of the resulting particles are significant compared to the speed of light, so we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n**2. List Given Information and Assumptions**\n\n*   Initial particle: Pion ($\\pi^+$) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass energy of pion ($m_{\\pi}c^2$): 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of muon ($m_{\\mu}c^2$): 105.7 MeV\n*   Rest mass of neutrino ($m_{\\nu}c^2$): The neutrino's mass is extremely small and is assumed to be zero for this calculation, which is a standard approximation in this context. So, $m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   The initial momentum of the system is zero because the pion is at rest ($\\vec{p}_{\\pi} = 0$).\n*   According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n    $\\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0$\n*   This implies that the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    $\\vec{p}_{\\mu} = -\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n    Let's denote the magnitude of their momentum as $p$:\n    $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   The initial energy of the system is the rest energy of the stationary pion.\n    $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$\n*   The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n*   The total energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}$.\n*   Therefore, the energy conservation equation is:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(p_{\\mu}c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + \\sqrt{(p_{\\nu}c)^2 + (m_{\\nu}c^2)^2}$\n\n**5. Solve for the Energies**\n\n*   Substitute the knowns into the energy equation. Since $p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu} = p$ and $m_{\\nu} = 0$:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0^2}$\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n*   **Careful Point:** For the massless neutrino, its total energy is $E_{\\nu} = pc$. Since its rest energy is zero, its total energy is purely kinetic energy. Thus, $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n*   Rearrange the equation to solve for $pc$:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n*   Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n*   The $(pc)^2$ term cancels out on both sides:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n*   Now, isolate the term $pc$:\n    $2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Numerical Values**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):**\n    As established, $KE_{\\nu} = pc$. Let's plug in the mass-energy values:\n    $KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{(139.6 \\text{ MeV})^2 - (105.7 \\text{ MeV})^2}{2 \\times 139.6 \\text{ MeV}}$\n    $KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} \\text{ MeV}$\n    $KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\text{ MeV}$\n    $KE_{\\nu} \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n    Rounding to one decimal place gives **29.8 MeV**.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):**\n    The total energy released in the decay is converted into the kinetic energies of the products.

Initial State:**\n*   The initial particle is a stationary pion ($\\pi^+$).\n*   Since it is stationary, its initial momentum ($p_i$) is 0.\n*   Its initial total energy ($E_i$) is its rest mass energy, $E_i = m_{\\pi}c^2$.\n\n**2.

The kinetic energy of a massless particle is its total energy, so $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\n**5. Solving for the Energies:**\nSubstitute the energy expressions into the conservation of energy equation:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\nTo solve for `pc` (which is the neutrino's kinetic energy), we rearrange and square the equation:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n\nThe $(pc)^2$ terms cancel out. Solving for `pc`:\n$pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\nThis value `pc` is the kinetic energy of the neutrino, $KE_{\\nu}$.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon ($KE_{\\mu}$) is its total energy minus its rest mass energy:\n$KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu}c^2$\nFrom energy conservation, $E_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - KE_{\\nu}$.\nTherefore, $KE_{\\mu} = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - KE_{\\nu}) - m_{\\mu}c^2 = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2 - KE_{\\nu}$.\n\n**6.

To solve this, we will apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   The initial pion is stationary, so the initial momentum of the system is zero.\n*   After the decay, the muon and the neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum to conserve momentum. Let's denote the magnitude of their momentum as 'p'.\n    $p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu} = p$\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   The initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion, $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$.\n*   The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon ($E_{\\mu}$) and the neutrino ($E_{\\nu}$).\n    $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n*   Therefore, by conservation of energy:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n\n**3.

This is a classic two-body decay problem that can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum. Since the initial pion is at rest, the total initial energy is its rest energy (139.6 MeV), and the initial momentum is zero. The two product particles must therefore move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. By applying the conservation laws, we can solve for the energies and momenta of the final particles. I will search for the standard formula or a worked example of this decay to ensure the methodology is correct.\n\n**Skeptic:** The search results confirm the general approach. Specifically, result mentions that for this two-particle decay, the products have definite energies, and it gives a value of 4.13 MeV for the kinetic energy of the muon, assuming a massless neutrino. Result provides a step-by-step calculation, arriving at 4.08 MeV for the muon's kinetic energy and 29.65 MeV for the neutrino's kinetic energy. Result also gives the momentum of the products as 29.792 MeV/c. These values are all very close to option A. The assumption of a massless neutrino is standard for this type of problem. The slight variations in the calculated values in the search results are likely due to using slightly different values for the rest masses of the pion and muon.\n\n**Proposer:** I agree. The search results have validated the proposed method. The physics is sound, and the assumption of a massless neutrino is appropriate. The minor differences in the results compared to my initial calculation can be attributed to the precision of the rest mass values used in those sources.

Understand the Physics of the Decay**\n\n*   **The Process:** A stationary positive pion ($\\pi^+$) decays into a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu_{\\mu}$). The reaction is: $\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu_{\\mu}$.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** In any particle decay, both total energy and total momentum must be conserved. Since the initial pion is stationary, this is a two-body decay from rest.\n*   **Relativistic Kinematics:** The speeds of the resulting particles are significant compared to the speed of light, so we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n**2. List Given Information and Assumptions**\n\n*   Initial particle: Pion ($\\pi^+$) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass energy of pion ($m_{\\pi}c^2$): 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of muon ($m_{\\mu}c^2$): 105.7 MeV\n*   Rest mass of neutrino ($m_{\\nu}c^2$): The neutrino's mass is extremely small and is assumed to be zero for this calculation, which is a standard approximation in this context. So, $m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   The initial momentum of the system is zero because the pion is at rest ($\\vec{p}_{\\pi} = 0$).\n*   According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n    $\\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0$\n*   This implies that the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    $\\vec{p}_{\\mu} = -\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n    Let's denote the magnitude of their momentum as $p$:\n    $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   The initial energy of the system is the rest energy of the stationary pion.\n    $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$\n*   The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n*   The total energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}$.\n*   Therefore, the energy conservation equation is:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(p_{\\mu}c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + \\sqrt{(p_{\\nu}c)^2 + (m_{\\nu}c^2)^2}$\n\n**5.

Since its rest energy is zero, its total energy is purely kinetic energy. Thus, $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n*   Rearrange the equation to solve for $pc$:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n*   Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n*   The $(pc)^2$ term cancels out on both sides:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n*   Now, isolate the term $pc$:\n    $2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n**6.

Therefore, E_ν = p_μc.\n\nNow, we can set up the energy conservation equation:\nm_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\nAnd the energy-momentum relation for the muon is:\nE_μ² = (p_μc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nSubstituting E_ν for p_μc:\nE_μ² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)²\n\nFrom energy conservation, we have E_μ = m_πc² - E_ν. Substituting this into the equation above:\n(m_πc² - E_ν)² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)²\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)E_ν + E_ν² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)²\n\nSolving for E_ν (which is the kinetic energy of the neutrino, KE_ν):\n(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)KE_ν\nKE_ν = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n\nPlugging in the values:\nKE_ν = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\nKE_ν = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\nKE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2\n**KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\nNow, we can find the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ). The total energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference in rest masses.\nQ = KE_μ + KE_ν = (m_π - m_μ)c²\nKE_μ = (m_π - m_μ)c² - KE_ν\nKE_μ = (139.6 - 105.7) - 29.8\nKE_μ = 33.9 - 29.8\n**KE_μ ≈ 4.1 MeV**\n\nA direct formula for the kinetic energy of the massive decay particle (muon) can also be derived:\nKE_μ = (m_πc² - m_μc²)² / (2m_πc²)\nKE_μ = (139.6 - 105.7)² / (2 * 139.6)\nKE_μ = (33.9)² / 279.2\nKE_μ = 1149.21 / 279.2\n**KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches one of the provided options. One source confirms the kinetic energy of the muon to be 4.13 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python script calculated the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino resulting from the decay of a stationary pion. Based on the conservation of energy and momentum, the kinetic energy of the muon was found to be 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino was found to be 29.78 MeV. These values correspond to option C, which lists the kinetic energies as 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV (rounding the neutrino's energy).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nIn the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (νμ), the principles of conservation of energy and momentum can be used to determine the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\nThe decay is represented as:\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + νμ\n\nGiven the rest masses:\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The rest mass of the neutrino (m_ν) is considered to be negligible or zero in this context.\n\nFrom the conservation of energy, the total energy of the initial pion (which is its rest energy since it is stationary) equals the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino:\nE_π = E_μ + E_ν\n\nThe total energy of a particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy (KE):\nm_π * c² = (m_μ * c² + KE_μ) + (m_ν * c² + KE_ν)\n\nSince the pion is at rest, the total momentum before the decay is zero. By the conservation of momentum, the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ) can be calculated using the following formula, derived from the conservation laws:\nKE_μ = [(m_π² - m_μ² - m_ν²)c⁴] / (2 * m_π * c²)\n\nAssuming the neutrino mass is zero (m_ν = 0):\nKE_μ = [(m_π² - m_μ²)c⁴] / (2 * m_π * c²)\nKE_μ = [(139.6² - 105.7²) MeV²] / (2 * 139.6 MeV)\nKE_μ = [(19488.16 - 11172.49) MeV²] / (279.2 MeV)\nKE_μ = [8315.67 MeV²] / (279.2 MeV)\nKE_μ ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_ν) is equal to its total energy since its rest mass is zero. The total energy released in the decay (Q-value) is the difference between the initial and final rest masses:\nQ = (m_π - m_μ - m_ν) * c²\nQ = (139.6 - 105.7 - 0) MeV\nQ = 33.9 MeV\n\nThis total released energy is distributed as kinetic energy between the muon and the neutrino:\nQ = KE_μ + KE_ν\n33.9 MeV = 29.78 MeV + KE_ν\nKE_ν = 33.9 - 29.78 MeV\nKE_ν ≈ 4.12 MeV\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the neutrino and 29.8 MeV for the muon.\n\nComparing these calculated values with the given options:\nA) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nC) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n**Proposer:** The problem asks for the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (νμ). This is a classic two-body decay problem that can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum. Since the initial pion is at rest, the total initial energy is its rest energy (139.6 MeV), and the initial momentum is zero. The two product particles must therefore move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. By applying the conservation laws, we can solve for the energies and momenta of the final particles. I will search for the standard formula or a worked example of this decay to ensure the methodology is correct.\n\n**Skeptic:** The search results confirm the general approach. Specifically, result mentions that for this two-particle decay, the products have definite energies, and it gives a value of 4.13 MeV for the kinetic energy of the muon, assuming a massless neutrino. Result provides a step-by-step calculation, arriving at 4.08 MeV for the muon's kinetic energy and 29.65 MeV for the neutrino's kinetic energy. Result also gives the momentum of the products as 29.792 MeV/c. These values are all very close to option A. The assumption of a massless neutrino is standard for this type of problem. The slight variations in the calculated values in the search results are likely due to using slightly different values for the rest masses of the pion and muon.\n\n**Proposer:** I agree. The search results have validated the proposed method. The physics is sound, and the assumption of a massless neutrino is appropriate. The minor differences in the results compared to my initial calculation can be attributed to the precision of the rest mass values used in those sources. I will now perform the calculation using the exact numbers provided in the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Define variables from the question:**\n    *   Rest energy of Pi(+) (m_π * c²): 139.6 MeV\n    *   Rest energy of mu(+) (m_μ * c²): 105.7 MeV\n    *   Rest energy of neutrino (m_ν * c²): 0 MeV (assumed)\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   Since the pion is stationary, the initial momentum is 0.\n    *   The muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momentum.
