    # --- Step 1: Determine the structure of the final product E ---
    # The reaction sequence is a Corey-Seebach reaction followed by a Wittig reaction.
    
    # Start: Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2-CHO)
    # Step 1-3 (Corey-Seebach): Protection, deprotonation, and alkylation with bromoethane.
    # This sequence effectively converts R-CHO to R-CO-R'.
    # Here, R is ethyl (from propionaldehyde) and R' is ethyl (from bromoethane).
    # The intermediate ketone (D) is therefore diethyl ketone, or 3-pentanone.
    # Structure of D: (CH3CH2)2C=O
    ketone_fragment = "(CH3CH2)2C"

    # Step 5 (Wittig Reaction):
    # The ylide is formed from 3-bromopentane.
    # 3-bromopentane: (CH3CH2)2CH-Br
    # The ylide formed is (CH3CH2)2C=PPh3.
    # The fragment that adds to the double bond is =(CH2CH3)2.
    ylide_fragment = "C(CH2CH3)2"

    # The Wittig reaction combines the ketone and ylide fragments at a new double bond.
    # Final Product E = ketone_fragment + "=" + ylide_fragment
    final_product_structure = ketone_fragment + "=" + ylide_fragment
    # This is (CH3CH2)2C=C(CH2CH3)2, which is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.

    # --- Step 2: Analyze the structure of E for 13C-NMR signals ---
    
    # A critical point is to check for stereoisomerism (E/Z isomers).
    # E/Z isomerism requires that each carbon of the double bond be attached to two *different* groups.
    # In our product, (Et)2C=C(Et)2, each carbon of the double bond is attached to two *identical* ethyl groups.
    # Therefore, no E/Z isomers are possible. Any answer that relies on summing signals from E and Z isomers is incorrect.
    
    # Now, analyze the symmetry of the single, symmetrical product.
    # The molecule (CH3CH2)2C=C(CH2CH3)2 is highly symmetrical.
    # It has a C2 axis of rotation through the center of the C=C bond.
    # This symmetry makes all four ethyl groups chemically equivalent.
    
    # Let's count the unique carbon environments:
    # 1. The two carbons of the central C=C double bond are equivalent. -> 1 signal
    # 2. The four methylene (-CH2-) carbons of the ethyl groups are all equivalent. -> 1 signal
    # 3. The four methyl (-CH3) carbons of the ethyl groups are all equivalent. -> 1 signal
