    This function simulates the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2
    to determine the number of possible organic products. It checks if the
    result matches the provided answer 'D' (which corresponds to 3 products).

    The simulation follows these steps:
    1.  Identify the two possible elimination pathways (H-abstraction and D-abstraction)
        to form two distinct benzyne intermediates.
    2.  For each intermediate, simulate the nucleophilic attack of the amide ion (NH2-)
        at both carbons of the triple bond.
    3.  Determine the structure of the resulting products by tracking the position of
        the deuterium atom relative to the new amino group.
    4.  Count the number of unique products.
    5.  Compare the count to the expected answer.
