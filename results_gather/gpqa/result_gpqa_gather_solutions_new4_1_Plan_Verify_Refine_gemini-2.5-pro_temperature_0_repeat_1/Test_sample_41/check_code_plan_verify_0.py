    # --- Step-by-step Calculation ---

    # 1. Relate equilibrium temperature (T_eq) to orbital distance (a).
    # For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, T_eq ∝ 1/√a.
    # This implies that the ratio of orbital distances is a_j / a_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)².

    # 2. Calculate the ratio of the orbital distances (a3 / a1).
    # a2 / a1 = (T1 / T2)²
    a2_div_a1 = T1_div_T2 ** 2
    # a3 / a2 = (T2 / T3)²
    a3_div_a2 = T2_div_T3 ** 2
    # a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1)
    a3_div_a1 = a3_div_a2 * a2_div_a1

    # 3. Apply Kepler's Third Law to relate orbital distance (a) to orbital period (P).
    # P² ∝ a³, which means P ∝ a^(3/2).
    # Therefore, the ratio of periods is P_j / P_i = (a_j / a_i)^(3/2).

    # 4. Calculate the final ratio of the orbital periods (P3 / P1).
    calculated_P3_div_P1 = a3_div_a1 ** (3/2)
