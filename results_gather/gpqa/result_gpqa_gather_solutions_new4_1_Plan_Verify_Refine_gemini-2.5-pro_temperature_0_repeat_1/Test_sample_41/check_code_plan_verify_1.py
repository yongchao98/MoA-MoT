    """
    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the exoplanet orbital period problem.

    The problem is solved by:
    1.  Relating equilibrium temperature (T_eq) to orbital distance (a).
        Since T_eq ∝ 1/√a, it follows that a ∝ 1/T_eq².
        Therefore, the ratio of orbital distances a_j/a_i = (T_eq_i/T_eq_j)².
    2.  Relating orbital distance (a) to orbital period (P) using Kepler's Third Law.
        Since P² ∝ a³, it follows that P ∝ a^(3/2).
        Therefore, the ratio of periods P_j/P_i = (a_j/a_i)^(3/2).
    3.  Combining these relationships to calculate the final ratio P3/P1.
