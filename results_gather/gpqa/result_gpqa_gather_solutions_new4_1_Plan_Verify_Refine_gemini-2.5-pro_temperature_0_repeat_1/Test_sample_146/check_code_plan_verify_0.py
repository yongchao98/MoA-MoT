    Checks the correctness of the answer for the proton-antiproton annihilation problem.

    The function recalculates the velocity of particle A based on the conservation of energy.

    From this, we solve for gamma, and then for the velocity v (as a fraction of c, beta).

    # 1. Solve for the Lorentz factor (gamma) from the energy conservation equation:

                f"This would mean the rest mass of the final products is greater than the initial energy.")

    # 3. Solve for velocity (beta = v/c) from the definition of gamma:
    # gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)  =>  beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)
    beta_squared = 1 - (1 / (gamma**2))
    calculated_beta = math.sqrt(beta_squared)

    # --- Verification ---
    # Check if the calculated velocity is close to the expected answer.
    # A tolerance of 0.005 is appropriate given the options are well-separated.
