    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the exoplanet temperature ratio question.
    
    The function verifies the calculation based on established physical principles:
    1. Equilibrium Temperature: T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)
    2. Kepler's Third Law: a ∝ P^(2/3)
    Combining these gives: T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)
    Therefore, the ratio T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3).
