Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.

**1. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**

The problem describes a four-step organic synthesis. The consensus among all detailed candidate answers is consistent and chemically sound.

*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br₂ → Product 1**
    *   This is an α-bromination of a ketone. The product is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.

*   **Step 2: Product 1 + NaOH, heat → Product 2**
    *   This is a classic **Favorskii rearrangement** of an α-halo ketone with a strong base. The reaction involves a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring.
    *   The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.

*   **Step 3: Product 2 + SOCl₂, pyridine → Product 3**
    *   This is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride.
    *   The product is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.

*   **Step 4: Product 3 + LiAlH(OtBu)₃ → Product 4**
    *   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent that selectively reduces acyl chlorides to aldehydes.
    *   The final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.

**2. Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**

The core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to determining the number of signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.

*   **Structure:** The molecule has a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).
*   **Symmetry and Stereochemistry:**
    *   The carbon atom of the ring attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is bonded to four different groups (H, -CHO, C2, and C5), making it a chiral center. The product is a racemic mixture.
    *   For NMR analysis, we consider the time-averaged structure due to rapid ring puckering (conformational changes). This rapid interconversion creates an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, C1, and the H on C1.
    *   This plane of symmetry makes the carbons C2 and C5 equivalent. It also makes C3 and C4 equivalent.
    *   However, the two hydrogens on C2 are not equivalent to each other. They are **diastereotopic** because they are on a carbon adjacent to a chiral center (C1). The same applies to the hydrogens on C3, C4, and C5.

**3. Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Atoms**

Based on the symmetry analysis:

1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This is in a unique environment. (1 type)
2.  **The proton on C1:** This methine proton is also unique. (1 type)
3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These four protons give rise to two distinct signals. The two "upper" protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent, and the two "lower" protons are equivalent. (2 types)
4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, these four protons give rise to two distinct signals. (2 types)

*   **Total Count:** 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.

**4. Conclusion**

The correct number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is 6. The provided options are:
A) 8
B) 6
C) 10
D) 7

The correct option is B.

*   Most candidate answers correctly deduce the reaction sequence and the final count of 6.
*   However, many of them are internally inconsistent, stating the answer is 6 but then selecting a different letter (e.g., A, C, or D).
*   Answer 5 correctly reasons that the number is 6 and correctly selects option B.
*   Answer 12 incorrectly reasons that the number is 10 (by ignoring time-averaged symmetry) but happens to select option B.

The overwhelming consensus on the chemical reasoning points to 6 distinct hydrogens.
