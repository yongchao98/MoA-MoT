    # The governing equation for the luminosity ratio is derived from the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:
    # L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4

    # 1. Calculate the radius term
    radius_term = R1_over_R2**2  # This is 1.5^2 = 2.25

    # 2. Calculate the temperature term, accounting for the Doppler Effect
    # The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2).
    # For Star 1 (v1=0), lambda_obs1 = lambda_emitted1.
    # For Star 2 (v2=700 km/s), lambda_obs2 = lambda_emitted2 * (1 + v2/c) (non-relativistic redshift).
    # Equating them: lambda_emitted1 = lambda_emitted2 * (1 + v2/c).
    # From Wien's Law, Temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the emitted wavelength (lambda_emitted).
    # Therefore, T1/T2 = lambda_emitted2 / lambda_emitted1.
    # From the Doppler relation, we find: lambda_emitted2 / lambda_emitted1 = 1 / (1 + v2/c).
    # So, the temperature ratio T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c).
