    # ii) Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. The para product is major due to sterics,
    #    but the ortho product (o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene) is formed and is required for the 1,2,3-pattern.
    #    This step is chemically possible, though not high-yield for the ortho isomer.
    # iii) Reduction of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene -> 2-tert-butylaniline.
    # iv) Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the -NH2 group is protonated to -NH3+, which is a meta-director.
    #    The -tBu group at C2 is an o,p-director. Both groups direct the incoming -NO2 to position 3. This is a valid step.
    #    Product: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.
    # v) Diazotization of the amine -> diazonium salt.
    # vi) Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.
