    # --- Correct Answer Derivation based on Physics Principles ---
    # 1. Due to electrostatic shielding, the field outside the conductor is
    #    determined solely by the charge on the outer surface.
    # 2. The charge induced on the outer surface is +q.
    # 3. This charge +q distributes uniformly on the spherical outer surface.
    # 4. By the Shell Theorem, the external field is the same as a point charge
    #    +q located at the center of the conductor.
    # 5. The distance to the external point P is L.
