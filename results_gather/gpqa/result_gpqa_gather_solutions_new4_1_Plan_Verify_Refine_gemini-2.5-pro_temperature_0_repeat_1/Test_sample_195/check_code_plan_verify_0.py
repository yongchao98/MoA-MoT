    Checks the correctness of the answer for the relativistic harmonic oscillator problem.

    1.  Symbolically derives the correct expression for v_max^2 from first principles (conservation of relativistic energy).
    2.  Compares this derived expression with the square of the formula from option C.
    3.  Verifies the reasoning provided in the final answer by checking the classical limit of option C.
    4.  Verifies the reasoning about the unphysical nature of option A.
    5.  Verifies the reasoning about the dimensional inconsistency of option D.
