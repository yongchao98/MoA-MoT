    # Ground truth analysis based on numerical methods for PDEs.
    # The question asks for the "key factor" that *converts* a sequential algorithm
    # into a parallel one in this specific context.

    # Option A: Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions
    # Analysis: Nonlocal boundary conditions create global dependencies across the problem domain.
    # These dependencies are an obstacle to parallelization, as they require extensive
    # communication between processors. This option hinders, not enables, parallelization.
    is_A_correct = False
    reason_A = "Nonlocal boundary conditions introduce global dependencies, which are an obstacle to parallelization, not an enabler."

    # Option B: Stability analysis
    # Analysis: Stability is a crucial property for any numerical method to be valid and produce
    # a non-diverging solution. It is a necessary condition for both sequential and parallel
    # algorithms to work correctly, but it is not the mechanism that creates the parallel structure.
    is_B_correct = False
    reason_B = "Stability analysis is a necessary condition for a valid algorithm, but it is not the mechanism that converts a sequential process into a parallel one."

    # Option C: Complex roots of fractional approximation
    # Analysis: The partial fraction decomposition works whether the roots (poles) of the
    # denominator are real or complex. The nature of the roots is a detail that affects
    # the implementation (e.g., requiring complex arithmetic), but the fundamental principle
    # of decomposition is what enables parallelism.
    is_C_correct = False
    reason_C = "The type of roots (real or complex) is a detail of the implementation; the decomposition itself is the key factor, which works for both."

    # Option D: Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation
    # Analysis: This is the core mechanism. A rational function R(z) is decomposed into a
    # sum of simpler terms: R(z) = c + Σ [c_j / (z - d_j)]. Applying this to the matrix
    # operator R(A*dt) transforms a single large problem into a sum of independent smaller
    # problems: Σ [c_j * (A*dt - d_j*I)⁻¹ * u]. Each of these smaller problems can be solved
    # on a separate processor. This is the very definition of converting the sequential task
    # into a parallel one.
    is_D_correct = True
    reason_D = "The linear partial fraction decomposition is the specific mathematical technique that breaks a single large, sequential problem into multiple smaller, independent sub-problems that can be solved concurrently."
