    # The question asks for the key factor that converts a sequential algorithm
    # into a parallel one in the context of solving higher-dimensional heat equations
    # using fractional approximations of the matrix exponential.

    # The options are:
    # A) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions
    # B) Stability analysis
    # C) Complex roots of fractional approximation
    # D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation

    # The provided final answer to check is 'D'.
    final_answer = "D"

    # --- Step 1: Encode the core scientific principle ---
    # The problem describes converting a PDE into a system of ODEs: du/dt = Au.
    # The solution over a time step involves the matrix exponential: u(t+dt) = exp(dt*A)u(t).
    # This is approximated by a rational function (fractional approximation): u_new ≈ R(dt*A)u_old.
    # A sequential algorithm solves this as one large, coupled system.
    # A parallel algorithm must break this into smaller, independent tasks that can be solved simultaneously.

    # --- Step 2: Analyze each option against the principle ---

    # Analysis of Option D: Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation
    # A rational function R(z) can be decomposed using partial fractions into a sum of simpler terms,
    # e.g., R(z) = c_0 + Σ [c_j / (z - d_j)].
    # When applied to the matrix operator, R(dt*A), this becomes a sum of independent operators:
    # R(dt*A)u = (c_0*I + Σ [c_j * (dt*A - d_j*I)⁻¹])u.
    # The calculation of each term (dt*A - d_j*I)⁻¹u corresponds to solving an independent linear system.
    # These independent systems can be solved concurrently on different processors.
    # This directly describes the conversion from a single sequential task to multiple parallel tasks.
    # Conclusion: This is the key enabling factor.
    is_D_correct = True
    reasoning_D = "This is the mathematical technique that decomposes the single, large computational step into multiple, smaller, independent linear systems that can be solved concurrently. This is the definition of converting a sequential algorithm to a parallel one in this context."

    # Analysis of Option A: Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions
    # Nonlocal boundary conditions introduce global dependencies across the problem domain.
    # Such dependencies are an obstacle to parallelism, as they require extensive communication
    # between processors. They do not enable the conversion to a parallel algorithm; they make it harder.
    # Conclusion: This is incorrect.
    reasoning_A = "Nonlocal boundary conditions typically introduce global dependencies, which hinder parallelization, rather than enabling it."

    # Analysis of Option B: Stability analysis
    # Stability is a crucial property for any numerical method (sequential or parallel) to ensure
    # that errors do not grow uncontrollably. It is a prerequisite for a *valid* algorithm,
    # but it is not the *mechanism* that creates the parallel structure. A stable method can be
    # either sequential or parallel.
    # Conclusion: This is incorrect.
    reasoning_B = "Stability analysis is a necessary condition for a valid numerical method, but it is not the mechanism that converts a sequential algorithm into a parallel one."

    # Analysis of Option C: Complex roots of fractional approximation
    # The roots of the denominator of the rational function can be real or complex. This affects
    # the details of the linear systems in the partial fraction expansion (e.g., requiring complex arithmetic).
    # However, the parallel structure comes from the decomposition itself, not the specific nature of the roots.
    # Option D is the more fundamental concept.
    # Conclusion: This is incorrect.
    reasoning_C = "The nature of the roots is a detail within the partial fraction decomposition. The decomposition itself (Option D) is the key enabling factor for parallelism, regardless of whether the roots are real or complex."
