    # --- Step 1: Analyze Reaction A (A + LiBH4 -> (R)-product) ---
    # 1. Chemoselectivity: LiBH4 reduces the ester group (-COOiBu) to an alcohol (-CH2OH).
    # 2. Stereochemistry Analysis:
    #    - In the starting material, the groups attached to the chiral center have the priority:
    #      P1: -CH2-COOiBu (ester side) > P2: -CH2-COOH (acid side) > P3: -CH2CH3 (ethyl)
    #    - After reduction, the ester group (P1) becomes an alcohol group (-CH2-CH2OH).
    #    - The new priority order is:
    #      New P1: -CH2-COOH (acid side) > New P2: -CH2-CH2OH (alcohol side) > New P3: -CH2CH3 (ethyl)
    #    - The original P1 group became the new P2, and the original P2 became the new P1.
    # 3. Conclusion for A: The swap in priorities of the top two groups causes an INVERSION of the R/S descriptor.
    #    Therefore, to obtain an (R)-product, the starting material A must be (S).

    #    - The acid group (P2) becomes an alcohol group (-CH2-CH2OH).
    #    - The new priority order is:
    #      New P1: -CH2-COOiBu (ester side) > New P2: -CH2-CH2OH (alcohol side) > New P3: -CH2CH3 (ethyl)
    #    - The priority order of the groups (P1 > P2 > P3) is maintained.
    # 3. Conclusion for B: Since the priority order does not change, the reaction proceeds with RETENTION of the R/S descriptor.
