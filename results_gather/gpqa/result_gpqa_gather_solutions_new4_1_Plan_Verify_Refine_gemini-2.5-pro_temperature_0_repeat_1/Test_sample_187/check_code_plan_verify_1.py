    # For a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance d_hkl is given by:

    # For the (111) plane, this simplifies to a more robust formula:
    # 1/d^2 = 3 / (a^2 * (1 + 2*cos(alpha)))
    # which gives d = a * sqrt((1 + 2*cos(alpha)) / 3)

    try:
        # Convert angle to radians for Python's math functions
