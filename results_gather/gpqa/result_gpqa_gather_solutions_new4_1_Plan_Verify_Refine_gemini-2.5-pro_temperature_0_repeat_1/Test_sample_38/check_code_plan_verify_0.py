    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the quantum mechanics problem.

    The core steps are:
    1. Analytically derive the expression for the normalization constant 'a'.
    2. Calculate the numerical value of 'a'.
    3. Compare the calculated value with the given options to find the best match.
    4. Verify that the chosen option from the answer satisfies the normalization condition.
