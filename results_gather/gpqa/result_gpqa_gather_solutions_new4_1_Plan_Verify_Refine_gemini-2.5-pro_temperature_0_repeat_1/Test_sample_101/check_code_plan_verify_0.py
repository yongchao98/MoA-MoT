            return "Incorrect. The construct uses a strong, ubiquitous CBA promoter, and the Western blot confirmed expression of the non-recombined proteins. Therefore, a missing enhancer is not the cause."
        else:
            return f"Incorrect. The provided answer '{final_answer_letter}' does not align with the core molecular issue. The correct reason is that the 34 bp lox2272 scar causes a frameshift mutation, preventing the synthesis of a functional eGFP protein."
