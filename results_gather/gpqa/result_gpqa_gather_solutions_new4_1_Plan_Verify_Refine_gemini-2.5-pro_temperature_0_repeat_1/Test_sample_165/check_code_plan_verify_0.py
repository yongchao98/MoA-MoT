def check_correctness_of_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the selected answer based on physics principles.

    The principles for the one-loop radiative mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson are:
    1.  The mass-squared is inversely proportional to the symmetry-breaking scale squared, (x^2+v^2).
    2.  Boson loop contributions (scalars, vectors) are positive.
    3.  Fermion loop contributions are negative.
    4.  All relevant heavy particles should be included in the sum.
