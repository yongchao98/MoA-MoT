    This function checks the correctness of the provided LLM answer for the radioactive decay problem.

    The problem states:
    - Decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%.
    - 50 minutes have passed without decay.
    - What is the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes?

    Options:
    A) 40%
    B) 44%
    C) 48%
    D) 52%

    The provided answer concludes that the probability is ~43.93%, which is closest to 44% (Option B).

    # The LLM answer correctly identifies that radioactive decay is a "memoryless" process.
