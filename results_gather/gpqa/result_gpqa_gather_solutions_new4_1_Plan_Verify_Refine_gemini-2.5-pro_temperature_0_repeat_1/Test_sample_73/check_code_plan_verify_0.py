    """
    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the radioactive decay problem.

    The problem is solved by following these steps:
    1.  Recognize that radioactive decay is a "memoryless" process. This means the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant to the future probability.
    2.  The problem simplifies to finding the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval.
    3.  Use the given information (32% decay probability in 100 minutes) to establish a relationship for the decay constant.
        - P(decay, t) = 1 - exp(-lambda * t)
        - P(survival, t) = exp(-lambda * t)
        - P(decay, 100) = 0.32 => P(survival, 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
        - So, exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.68
    4.  Calculate the required probability of decay in 150 minutes.
        - P(decay, 150) = 1 - P(survival, 150)
        - P(survival, 150) = exp(-lambda * 150) = (exp(-lambda * 100))^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5
    5.  The final probability is 1 - 0.68^1.5.
    6.  This calculated value is then compared to the given options to find the closest one.
