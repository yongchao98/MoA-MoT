    # --- Step 1: Formulate the ratio of the mean free paths ---
    # From the formulas:
    # λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)
    # λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)
    # The ratio λ2 / λ1 is:
    # (1 / (n * σ_eg)) / (1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg))
    # = (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)
    # = sqrt(2) * (σ_gg / σ_eg)

    # --- Step 2: Apply the physical constraint on the cross-sections ---
    # The key insight is that for high-energy electrons, the gas-gas kinetic
    # cross-section is significantly larger than the electron-gas scattering cross-section.
    # Therefore, the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) must be greater than 1.
    # Let's represent this ratio with a variable. Any value > 1 is valid for this check.
    # For example, let's assume σ_gg is 5 times larger than σ_eg.
    cross_section_ratio = 5.0  # This represents σ_gg / σ_eg, and must be > 1.

    # --- Step 3: Calculate the resulting ratio of the mean free paths ---
    lambda_ratio = math.sqrt(2) * cross_section_ratio  # This is λ2 / λ1

    # --- Step 4: Evaluate the options based on the calculated ratio ---
    # The options can be translated into conditions on the lambda_ratio:
    # A) λ2 = λ1  --> lambda_ratio == 1
    # B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 --> lambda_ratio >= 1.22
    # C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 --> 1 < lambda_ratio < 1.22
    # D) λ2 < λ1 --> lambda_ratio < 1

    is_B_true = (lambda_ratio >= 1.22)

    # Since lambda_ratio > sqrt(2) (~1.414), the condition for B is always met.
    # Let's also confirm other options are false.
