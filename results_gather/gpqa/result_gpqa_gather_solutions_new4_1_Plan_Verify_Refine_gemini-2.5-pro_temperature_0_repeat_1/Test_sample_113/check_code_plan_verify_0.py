Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reagents for the given reactions.

### Analysis of the Problem

The task is to identify the correct reagents, labeled A and B, for two separate organic chemistry reactions.

**Reaction 1: `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`**

1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction converts a ketone (butan-2-one) into a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile). This is a nucleophilic addition reaction to the carbonyl group.
2.  **Analyze the mechanism:** The reaction proceeds in two main steps:
    *   **Nucleophilic Attack:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻), provided by NaCN, is a strong nucleophile that attacks the electrophilic carbon of the carbonyl group in butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.
    *   **Protonation:** The negatively charged alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to form the final, stable hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin.
3.  **Determine Reagent A:** Reagent A's role is to provide the proton (H⁺) for the second step.
    *   Looking at the options for A, we have `H3O+` and `NaHSO3`.
    *   `H3O+` represents a hydronium ion, which is the form a strong acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) takes in water. It is an excellent proton source and is required to complete the reaction.
    *   `NaHSO3` (sodium bisulfite) is a different reagent that also adds to carbonyls but forms a bisulfite adduct, not a cyanohydrin. It is a distractor.
    *   Therefore, **A must be H₃O⁺**. This eliminates options A and D.

**Reaction 2: `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`**

1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction converts a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.
2.  **Analyze the mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires harsh conditions, typically heating with water in the presence of a strong acid or a strong base as a catalyst.
3.  **Determine Reagent B:** Reagent B is the catalyst for this hydrolysis. We must choose between the remaining options for B, which are `HCl` and `CH3COOH`.
    *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong mineral acid. It is a standard and highly effective catalyst for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.
    *   `CH3COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to catalyze this hydrolysis reaction efficiently. The reaction would be extremely slow or would not go to completion.
    *   Therefore, the most suitable reagent for **B is HCl**.

### Conclusion

*   For the first reaction, the required reagent **A is H₃O⁺**.
*   For the second reaction, the required reagent **B is HCl**.

This combination of reagents, A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, corresponds to option B.

A careful review of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly identified the necessary reagents through chemical reasoning, many mapped them to the incorrect letter, likely due to a different set of options being presented to them. The chemical logic, however, strongly and consistently points to H₃O⁺ and HCl.
