    # Step 1: Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene
    # Principle: Catalytic hydrogenation (H2/PdC) selectively reduces the less substituted double bond.
    # Outcome: The exocyclic isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group. The C4 stereocenter is unaffected.
    # Product 1: (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.
    
    # Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1
    # Principle: m-CPBA attacks the double bond from the face opposite (trans) to the bulky C4-isopropyl group.
    # Outcome: This diastereoselective attack forms a specific epoxide.
    # Stereochemistry of Product 2 (major isomer): (1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.
    product_2_config = "1S, 2R, 4R"

    # Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening
    # Principle: Under basic conditions (NaOMe), the nucleophile (MeO-) attacks the less hindered carbon (C2) via an S_N2 mechanism.
    # Outcome: S_N2 attack proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked center (C2). C1 and C4 are unaffected.
    # Stereochemical change: C2 inverts from (R) to (S).
    # Stereochemistry of Product 3: (1S, 2S, 4R)-2-methoxy-1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol.
    product_3_config = "1S, 2S, 4R"

    # Step 4: Esterification
    # Principle: Steglich esterification (propanoic acid, DCC, DMAP) converts the alcohol to an ester with retention of configuration.
    # Outcome: The stereochemistry of the ring is preserved.
    # Stereochemistry of Product 4: (1S, 2S, 4R).
