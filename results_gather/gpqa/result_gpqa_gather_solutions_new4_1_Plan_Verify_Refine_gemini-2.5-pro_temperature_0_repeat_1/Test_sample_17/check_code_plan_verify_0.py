    # --- Calculation ---
    # The abundance notation [X/Y] follows the identity: [A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]
    # and [A/B] = [A/C] - [B/C]

    # Step 1: Calculate the silicon abundance for Star 1, [Si/H]_1
    # [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1
    Si_H_1 = Si_Fe_1 + Fe_H_1

    # Step 2: Calculate the silicon abundance for Star 2, [Si/H]_2
    # We use the identity [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2
    # Rearranging for [Si/H]_2 gives: [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2
    Si_H_2 = Mg_H_2 - Mg_Si_2

    # Step 3: Calculate the ratio of silicon abundances
    # The question asks for the ratio R = (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2
    # In logarithmic form: log10(R) = log10((n_Si/n_H)_1) - log10((n_Si/n_H)_2)
    # From the definition of [X/Y], we know that log10(R) = [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2
    log_ratio = Si_H_1 - Si_H_2

    # The final ratio is 10 raised to the power of log_ratio
    calculated_ratio = 10**log_ratio
