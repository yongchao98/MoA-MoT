    Checks the correctness of the provided LLM answer by symbolically deriving the energy spectrum.
    
    The steps are:
    1. Define the potential in Cartesian coordinates based on the given polar form.
    2. Identify the system as a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator.
    3. Calculate the angular frequencies for the x and y motions.
    4. Derive the total energy spectrum.
    5. Compare the derived spectrum with the given options to find the correct option.
