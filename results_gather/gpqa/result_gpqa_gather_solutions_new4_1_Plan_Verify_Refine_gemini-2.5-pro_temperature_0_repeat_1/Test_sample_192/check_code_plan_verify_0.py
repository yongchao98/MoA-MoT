    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer by symbolically
    deriving the relationship using the sympy library.

    The problem involves transforming a number density function from parallax (plx)
    space to distance (r) space.

    1.  **Given:** The number of stars per unit parallax, dN/d(plx), is
        proportional to 1/plx^5. This is the standard physical interpretation
        of such a statement.
    2.  **Relationship:** Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, plx ‚àù 1/r.
    3.  **Goal:** Find the number of stars per unit distance, dN/dr.
    4.  **Method:** Use the chain rule for transforming distributions:
        dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|
