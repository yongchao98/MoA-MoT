Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the incorrect statement.

**1. Identify the Compounds in the Reaction Sequence**

*   **Compound A (C3H6)** reacts with Br2/CCl4, a test for unsaturation. This indicates A is an alkene. Therefore, **A is propene (CH3-CH=CH2)**.
*   **Compound B** is the product of the addition of bromine to propene. **B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br))**.
*   **Compound C** is formed when B reacts with alcoholic KOH, which causes double dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne. **C is propyne (CH3-C≡CH)**.
*   **Compound D** is formed when propyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube, which causes cyclic trimerization. **D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.
*   **Compound E** is formed by the reaction of D with strong acids (nitration). **E is 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.
*   **Compound F** is formed by the reduction of E with Fe/HCl. **F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesidine)**.
*   **Compound G** is formed by the reaction of F with nitrous acid (diazotization). **G is the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.
*   **Compound H** is formed by the reaction of G with NaOH (hydrolysis of the diazonium salt). **H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.

**2. Evaluate Each Statement**

Let's analyze the four statements based on the identified compounds.

*   **A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**
    *   Compound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Due to its high symmetry, the three aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, and the nine protons of the three methyl groups are also chemically equivalent. This results in two distinct signals. Since neither group of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with, both signals appear as singlets.
    *   This statement is **correct**.

*   **B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**
    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produces a distinct violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored complex. The ferric chloride solution itself is yellow. A yellow color in the final mixture indicates a *negative* test, meaning no reaction has occurred. This lack of reaction is expected for a sterically hindered phenol like H. The statement that the compound "gives" a yellow color is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow product, rather than the absence of a reaction.
    *   This statement is **incorrect**.

*   **C) C is a flammable gas.**
    *   Compound C is propyne. Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, so it is a gas at standard room temperature. Like other small hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable.
    *   This statement is **correct**.

*   **D) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**
    *   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for producing a large class of dyes, particularly azo dyes, through diazotization and coupling reactions.
    *   This statement is **correct**.

**Conclusion**

Statements A, C, and D are correct descriptions of the respective compounds. Statement B is incorrect because the ferric chloride test for phenols does not give a yellow color as a positive result; a yellow color indicates a negative test.
