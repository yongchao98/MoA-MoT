    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the quantum mechanics problem.

    The problem asks for the probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 for the
    observable P, given the system is in the state |ψ⟩.

    The probability is given by the formula:
    P(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|^2 / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)
    where |v_λ⟩ is the eigenvector for eigenvalue λ.

    If we use the normalized eigenvector |v_λ_norm⟩, the formula simplifies to:
    P(λ) = |⟨v_λ_norm|ψ⟩|^2 / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩
