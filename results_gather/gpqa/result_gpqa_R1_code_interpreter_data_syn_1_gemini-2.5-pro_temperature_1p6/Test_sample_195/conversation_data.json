    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem involves a conservative force (Hooke's Law, F = -kx), so the total energy of the system is conserved. We must use the principles of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Define the energy components:**\n    *   **Potential Energy (U):** The potential energy for a spring-like force F = -kx is given by U(x) = (1/2)kx². We set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position (x=0).\n    *   **Relativistic Kinetic Energy (K):** The kinetic energy of a particle with mass `m` moving at speed `v` is given by K = (γ - 1)mc², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n3.  **Formulate the conservation of energy equation:** The total energy `E_total` of the oscillator is the sum of its kinetic and potential energies. This total energy remains constant throughout the motion.\n    E_total = K + U = (γ - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx²\n\n4.  **Analyze the system at two key points:**\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum displacement (amplitude).**\n        *   Position: x = A\n        *   At the maximum amplitude, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction. So, its speed is v = 0.\n        *   Because v=0, the Lorentz factor γ = 1 / √(1 - 0²/c²) = 1.\n        *   The kinetic energy is K = (1 - 1)mc² = 0.\n        *   The potential energy is at its maximum: U = (1/2)kA².\n        *   The total energy of the system is E_total = 0 + (1/2)kA² = (1/2)kA².\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium position.**\n        *   Position: x = 0\n        *   At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero, U = 0.\n        *   The speed is at its maximum, v = v_max.\n        *   The Lorentz factor is γ_max = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²).\n        *   The kinetic energy is at its maximum: K = (γ_max - 1)mc².\n        *   The total energy of the system is E_total = (γ_max - 1)mc² + 0 = (γ_max - 1)mc².\n\n5.  **Apply energy conservation:** The total energy at Point 1 must equal the total energy at Point 2.\n    (1/2)kA² = (γ_max - 1)mc²\n\n6.  **Solve for v_max:** We need to isolate v_max from the equation. First, let's solve for γ_max.\n    *   Divide by mc²:  (kA²) / (2mc²) = γ_max - 1\n    *   Rearrange for γ_max:  γ_max = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)\n\n7.  **Substitute the definition of γ_max:**\n    *   1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)\n\n8.  **Continue solving for v_max:**\n    *   Take the reciprocal of both sides: √(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))\n    *   Square both sides: 1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²\n    *   Rearrange the terms to solve for v_max²/c²: v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²\n    *   Multiply by c² and take the square root: v_max = c * √[1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²]\n\n9.  **Compare with the given options:** The derived expression for v_max is:\n    v_max = c * √[1 - 1 / (1 + (kA² / (2mc²)))²]\n\n    This exactly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
