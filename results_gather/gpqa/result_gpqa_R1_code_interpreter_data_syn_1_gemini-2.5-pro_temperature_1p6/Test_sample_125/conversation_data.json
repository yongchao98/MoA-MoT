    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I:**\n    *   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at C5, which has the (S) configuration.\n    *   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride), followed by an acidic workup (H3O+). LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The carbonyl group at C3 will be reduced to a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is chiral and the reagent (LAH) is achiral, the hydride ion can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces. This leads to the formation of two products that are diastereomers. The existing stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n        *   Product 1A: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   Product 1B: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products, (3S, 5S) and (3R, 5S), are diastereomers because they have one stereocenter in common (5S) and one that is different (3S vs. 3R).\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II:**\n    *   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3). This is an achiral molecule.\n    *   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium borohydride), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups. \"Excess\" ensures both are reduced.\n    *   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol (CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3). This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material and the reagent are both achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze the stereoisomers:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are enantiomers. They will be produced in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture.\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (they are superimposable).\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Mixture:**\n    *   The final mixture contains all the products from both reactions. Let's list the distinct molecules:\n        1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n        2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    *   In total, there are **5 different stereoisomers** in the mixture.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, including polarity, so they cannot be separated by achiral HPLC. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and different polarities, so they can be separated.\n    *   Let's analyze the mixture:\n        *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different polarities and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n        *   From Reaction II, the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) products are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will form **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R)/(2S, 4S) pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them, forming **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C7 methoxy-alcohols) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally very different. The diols are significantly more polar than the methoxy-alcohols. Therefore, it is expected that all products from Reaction I will be well-separated from all products of Reaction II.\n    *   Total peaks = (peaks from Rxn I products) + (peaks from Rxn II products) = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. It is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   A chiral column can distinguish between all stereoisomers that are not identical, as they will have different diastereomeric interactions with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   The mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers.\n        1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of 1)\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of 3)\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n    *   Each of these 5 compounds will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, resulting in different retention times.\n    *   Therefore, chiral HPLC will resolve all 5 components.\n    *   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Normal-phase HPLC will show 4 peaks.\n    *   Chiral HPLC will show 5 peaks.\n    *   This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
