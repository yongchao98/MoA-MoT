    "*   **Analysis of the starting material (Compound X) from spectroscopic data:**\n\n1.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The broad absorption in the range of 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid (often conjugated with an aromatic ring).\n    *   The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet with a chemical shift greater than 10 ppm is a definitive signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at a higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm) is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl group analysis (the remaining signals):**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons is a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons is a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) mentioned above.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton is the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift indicates it is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The pieces are a `CH₃-CH₂-` fragment and a `CH₃-CH-` fragment, all connected at the methine carbon. This forms a **sec-butyl group**: `CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)-`.\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (C), but this is the starting material.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n1.  **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n2.  **Transformation:** This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and other alkyl groups are not affected by this reagent.\n3.  **Product Formation:** The reaction reduces the -COOH group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Final Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Comparing this with the given options:\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl group.\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - Correct product.\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
