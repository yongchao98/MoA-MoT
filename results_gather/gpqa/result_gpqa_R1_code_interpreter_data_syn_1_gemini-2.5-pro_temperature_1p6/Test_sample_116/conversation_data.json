    "*   **Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The user wants to identify which of the four given compounds can exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs in molecules that are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (due to restricted rotation around a bond, as seen in some substituted biphenyls). A molecule is achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. It has two phenyl rings linked by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Substituents:**\n        *   On one ring: a nitro group (-NO2) at position 6 and a dimethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3) at position 2.\n        *   On the other ring: a nitro group (-NO2) at position 6' and a dimethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3) at position 2'.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Substituted biphenyls can exhibit a special type of chirality called **atropisomerism** if the rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is restricted. This happens when there are bulky substituents at the *ortho* positions (2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   In this molecule, all four *ortho* positions are substituted with bulky groups (-NO2 and -COOCH3). This steric hindrance prevents the two phenyl rings from becoming coplanar (lying in the same plane).\n    *   Because free rotation is blocked, the molecule is locked into a twisted conformation. We must check if this conformation is chiral.\n    *   A molecule is chiral if it lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. This particular substitution pattern does not result in any such symmetry elements. The molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule exhibits axial chirality (atropisomerism) and is therefore optically active.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine the central carbon atom, C2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   A carbon atom bonded to four different groups is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter).\n    *   Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and is therefore optically active. It exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S isomers).\n\n4.  **Evaluate Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. It consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:**\n        *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule.\n        *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, there is a plane of symmetry that bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings and contains the C=O bond. Also, a C2 rotation axis passes through the C=O bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry, benzophenone is an achiral molecule and is optically inactive.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two -COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:**\n        *   The molecule is planar.\n        *   It has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself).\n        *   It also possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any point on one side of the center has an identical point on the opposite side.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and is optically inactive.\n\n6.  **Final Summary:**\n    *   Compound 1: Optically active (due to atropisomerism).\n    *   Compound 2: Optically active (due to a chiral center).\n    *   Compound 3: Optically inactive (achiral, has a plane of symmetry).\n    *   Compound 4: Optically inactive (achiral, has a plane of symmetry and center of inversion).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
