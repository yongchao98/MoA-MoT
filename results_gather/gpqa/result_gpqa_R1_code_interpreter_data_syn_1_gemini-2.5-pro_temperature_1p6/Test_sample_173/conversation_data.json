    "An atomic nucleus with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV fissions into two fragments. We need to find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment calculated relativistically and classically.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n**1. Define the initial state:**\n*   Initial nucleus is at rest.\n*   Total initial energy, E_initial = Rest-mass energy = M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   Initial momentum, P_initial = 0.\n\n**2. Define the final state:**\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses m₁ and m₂. Let m₁ be the more massive fragment.\n*   Their rest-mass energies are E_rest1 = m₁c² and E_rest2 = m₂c².\n*   Their kinetic energies are T₁ and T₂.\n*   Their total energies are E₁ = E_rest1 + T₁ and E₂ = E_rest2 + T₂.\n*   Their momenta are p₁ and p₂.\n\n**3. Use the given information to find the rest masses:**\n*   \"one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other\": This is interpreted as m₁ = 2 * m₂. Therefore, E_rest1 = 2 * E_rest2.\n*   \"The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M\": This means m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M. In terms of energy:\n    E_rest1 + E_rest2 = 0.99 * (M*c²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n*   Now we have a system of two equations:\n    1.  E_rest1 + E_rest2 = 297 GeV\n    2.  E_rest1 = 2 * E_rest2\n*   Substituting (2) into (1):\n    (2 * E_rest2) + E_rest2 = 297 GeV\n    3 * E_rest2 = 297 GeV\n    E_rest2 = 99 GeV.\n*   Then, E_rest1 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation Laws:**\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before fission equals the total energy after.\n    E_initial = E₁ + E₂\n    300 GeV = (T₁ + E_rest1) + (T₂ + E_rest2)\n    300 GeV = T₁ + 198 GeV + T₂ + 99 GeV\n    300 GeV = T₁ + T₂ + 297 GeV\n    The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is Q = T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before is zero, so the total momentum after must also be zero.\n    P_initial = p₁ + p₂ = 0.\n    This implies the fragments move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude: |p₁| = |p₂| = p.\n\n**5. Calculate T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value):**\n*   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². This can be rewritten in terms of kinetic energy T, where E = T + mc²:\n    (pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2T(mc²).\n*   Since the momentum magnitudes are equal, p₁² = p₂² and thus (p₁c)² = (p₂c)².\n    T₁² + 2*T₁*(E_rest1) = T₂² + 2*T₂*(E_rest2)\n*   Substitute the known values and the relation T₂ = 3 - T₁:\n    T₁² + 2*T₁*(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2*(3 - T₁)*(99)\n    T₁² + 396*T₁ = (9 - 6*T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198*T₁)\n    T₁² + 396*T₁ = T₁² - 204*T₁ + 603\n    396*T₁ = -204*T₁ + 603\n    600*T₁ = 603\n    T₁ (relativistic) = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV.\n\n**6. Calculate T₁ (Classical Approximation):**\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p²/2m.\n*   From conservation of momentum |p₁| = |p₂|, we get:\n    p₁²/ (2m₁) = p₂²/ (2m₂)  =>  T₁_cl * m₁ = ... No, this is incorrect.\n    p² = 2m*T_cl.\n    Since p₁² = p₂², we have:\n    2*m₁*T₁_cl = 2*m₂*T₂_cl\n    m₁*T₁_cl = m₂*T₂_cl\n*   Using the mass ratio m₁ = 2m₂:\n    (2m₂)*T₁_cl = m₂*T₂_cl\n    T₂_cl = 2*T₁_cl\n*   The total kinetic energy is still T₁_cl + T₂_cl = 3 GeV.\n*   Substitute T₂_cl:\n    T₁_cl + 2*T₁_cl = 3 GeV\n    3*T₁_cl = 3 GeV\n    T₁_cl (classical) = 1 GeV.\n\n**7. Find the Difference:**\n*   Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n*   Convert the result to MeV:\n    Difference = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, the calculation is verified using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Constants and given values\nE_rest_initial_GeV = 300.0\nmass_sum_fraction = 0.99\nmass_ratio = 2.0  # m1 = 2 * m2, where m1 is the more massive fragment\n\n# Step 1: Calculate rest mass energies of the fragments\n# Sum of rest mass energies of fragments\nE_rest_sum_GeV = E_rest_initial_GeV * mass_sum_fraction\n# We have E_rest1 + E_rest2 = E_rest_sum_GeV\n# and E_rest1 = mass_ratio * E_rest2\n# So, (mass_ratio * E_rest2) + E_rest2 = E_rest_sum_GeV\n# E_rest2 * (mass_ratio + 1) = E_rest_sum_GeV\nE_rest2_GeV = E_rest_sum_GeV / (mass_ratio + 1.0)\nE_rest1_GeV = E_rest_sum_GeV - E_rest2_GeV # This is the rest mass energy of the more massive fragment\n\n# Step 2: Calculate total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n# From conservation of energy: E_initial = E_final_total = T1 + T2 + E_rest1 + E_rest2\n# E_rest_initial_GeV = Q_GeV + E_rest_sum_GeV\nQ_GeV = E_rest_initial_GeV - E_rest_sum_GeV\n\n# Step 3: Calculate T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) using relativistic mechanics\n# From conservation of momentum, |p1| = |p2| => p1^2 = p2^2\n# Using the relativistic relation (p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*E_rest1_GeV = T2^2 + 2*T2*E_rest2_GeV\n# We also know T1 + T2 = Q_GeV => T2 = Q_GeV - T1\n# Substituting T2:\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*E_rest1_GeV = (Q_GeV - T1)^2 + 2*(Q_GeV - T1)*E_rest2_GeV\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*E_rest1_GeV = Q_GeV^2 - 2*Q_GeV*T1 + T1^2 + 2*Q_GeV*E_rest2_GeV - 2*T1*E_rest2_GeV\n# 2*T1*E_rest1_GeV = Q_GeV^2 - 2*Q_GeV*T1 + 2*Q_GeV*E_rest2_GeV - 2*T1*E_rest2_GeV\n# T1 * (2*E_rest1_GeV + 2*Q_GeV + 2*E_rest2_GeV) = Q_GeV^2 + 2*Q_GeV*E_rest2_GeV\n# T1 * 2 * (E_rest1_GeV + E_rest2_GeV + Q_GeV) = Q_GeV * (Q_GeV + 2*E_rest2_GeV)\n# T1 * 2 * (E_rest_sum_GeV + Q_GeV) = Q_GeV * (Q_GeV + 2*E_rest2_GeV)\n# Since E_rest_sum_GeV + Q_GeV = E_rest_initial_GeV\n# T1 * 2 * E_rest_initial_GeV = Q_GeV * (Q_GeV + 2*E_rest2_GeV)\nT1_relativistic_GeV = (Q_GeV * (Q_GeV + 2 * E_rest2_GeV)) / (2 * E_rest_initial_GeV)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate T1 using classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n# From conservation of momentum, p1 = p2 => sqrt(2*m1*T1) = sqrt(2*m2*T2) => m1*T1 = m2*T2\n# Since E_rest is proportional to m, we can use E_rest instead of m.\n# E_rest1_GeV * T1_classical = E_rest2_GeV * T2_classical\n# We also know m1 = 2*m2, so E_rest1 = 2*E_rest2\n# 2 * E_rest2_GeV * T1_classical = E_rest2_GeV * T2_classical => T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical\n# Using conservation of kinetic energy: T1_classical + T2_classical = Q_GeV\n# T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = Q_GeV\n# 3*T1_classical = Q_GeV\nT1_classical_GeV = Q_GeV / (mass_ratio + 1.0)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the difference and convert to MeV\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic_GeV - T1_classical_GeV\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"E_rest1 = {E_rest1_GeV} GeV\")\nprint(f\"E_rest2 = {E_rest2_GeV} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Q-value = {Q_GeV} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1 = {T1_relativistic_GeV} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Classical T1 = {T1_classical_GeV} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference = {difference_MeV} MeV\")\n\n```\nE_rest1 = 198.0 GeV\nE_rest2 = 99.0 GeV\nQ-value = 3.000000000000057 GeV\nRelativistic T1 = 1.005 GeV\nClassical T1 = 1.000000000000019 GeV\nDifference = 4.9999999999980685 MeV\nThe code confirms the result.

    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy, E_initial = M*c² = 300 GeV.\n    *   Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is P_initial = 0.\n    *   The total initial energy is equal to its rest-mass energy.\n\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's denote m₁ as the more massive fragment, so m₁ = 2m₂. This also means their rest-mass energies are related: E_rest1 = m₁c² = 2(m₂c²) = 2 * E_rest2.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n    *   In terms of energy: E_rest1 + E_rest2 = 0.99 * (M*c²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n    *   The fragments will have kinetic energies T₁ and T₂, and momenta p₁ and p₂.\n\n### **2. Calculate Rest-Mass Energies and Q-Value**\n\nWe have a system of two equations to find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n1.  E_rest1 + E_rest2 = 297 GeV\n2.  E_rest1 = 2 * E_rest2\n\nSubstitute (2) into (1):\n(2 * E_rest2) + E_rest2 = 297 GeV\n3 * E_rest2 = 297 GeV\nE_rest2 = 99 GeV\n\nNow, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\nE_rest1 = 2 * E_rest2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV.\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (the Q-value of the fission) is found by applying the conservation of energy:\nE_initial = E_final\nE_initial = (T₁ + E_rest1) + (T₂ + E_rest2)\n300 GeV = (T₁ + T₂) + (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n300 GeV = (T₁ + T₂) + 297 GeV\nQ = T₁ + T₂ = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\n### **3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe initial momentum was zero. By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero.\nP_final = p₁ + p₂ = 0\nThis implies that the fragments move in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude: |p₁| = |p₂| = p.\n\n### **4. Calculate T₁ using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy (T = E - mc²) as:\n(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2T(mc²)\n\nSince the magnitudes of the momenta are equal, (p₁c)² = (p₂c)²:\nT₁² + 2*T₁*(E_rest1) = T₂² + 2*T₂*(E_rest2)\n\nWe know that T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁. Substituting the values for E_rest1, E_rest2, and T₂:\nT₁² + 2*T₁*(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2*(3 - T₁)*(99)\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = (9 - 6*T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198*T₁)\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = T₁² - 204*T₁ + 603\n396*T₁ = -204*T₁ + 603\n600*T₁ = 603\nT₁ (relativistic) = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV.\n\n### **5. Calculate T₁ using Classical Mechanics (Approximation)**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p²/2m.\nFrom conservation of momentum, |p₁| = |p₂| = p, so p² = 2m₁T₁_cl = 2m₂T₂_cl.\nm₁T₁_cl = m₂T₂_cl\nSince m₁ = 2m₂, we have (2m₂)T₁_cl = m₂T₂_cl, which simplifies to:\nT₂_cl = 2T₁_cl\n\nThe total kinetic energy is T₁_cl + T₂_cl = 3 GeV.\nSubstituting for T₂_cl:\nT₁_cl + 2T₁_cl = 3 GeV\n3T₁_cl = 3 GeV\nT₁ (classical) = 1 GeV.\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)\nDifference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nFinally, convert this difference to MeV:\nDifference = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThis calculation was confirmed by the provided Python script execution, which gave a result of ~5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
