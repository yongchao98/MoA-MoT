    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material (Substrate)**\n\nThe substrate is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Structure:** The name describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide ring. The \"7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane\" part indicates a bicyclic system with bridgehead carbons at C1 and C6. An oxygen atom (O7) forms a one-atom bridge, and a four-carbon chain (C2-C3-C4-C5) forms the other bridge. This is the structure of a cyclohexene epoxide.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl (Me) groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We need to determine the spatial arrangement of the groups from the given (R/S) configuration. Let's assume the plane of the cyclohexane ring is horizontal and the epoxide oxygen is pointing 'up' (beta, β). We will use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules to determine the orientation of the other groups.\n\n    *   **At C6 (6S):** The substituents are O(7), C(1), C(5), and H. The CIP priority is O > C(1) > C(5) > H. For the configuration to be (S), with the lowest priority group (H) pointing towards the viewer ('up' or beta), the path from priority 1 (O) to 2 (C1) to 3 (C5) must be clockwise. In our drawing with the epoxide up, this holds true. So, the **Hydrogen at C6 is 'up' (β)**, cis to the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   **At C1 (1R):** The substituents are O(7), C(6), C(2), and Me. The CIP priority is O > C(6) > C(2) > Me. For the configuration to be (R), with the lowest priority group (Me) pointing away from the viewer ('down' or alpha), the path from O -> C6 -> C2 must be clockwise. This is consistent. So, the **Methyl group at C1 is 'down' (α)**, trans to the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   **At C3 (3R):** The priority is C(2) > C(4) > Me > H. For the (R) configuration, the methyl group must be 'down' (α).\n    *   **At C4 (4R):** The priority is C(5) > C(3) > Me > H. For the (R) configuration, the methyl group must be 'down' (α).\n\n*   **Summary of Starting Material Structure:**\n    *   The epoxide ring is on the 'up' (β) face of the molecule.\n    *   The hydrogen at C6 is also 'up' (β), cis to the epoxide.\n    *   The methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are all on the 'down' (α) face, trans to the epoxide.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagent and Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. It is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem states that organocuprates react with saturated epoxides via nucleophilic attack. This is an epoxide ring-opening reaction.\n\n**3. Determine the Regioselectivity and Stereochemistry of the Reaction**\n\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The problem explicitly states that \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n    *   We must compare the steric hindrance at the two epoxide carbons, C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Clearly, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The problem states that \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   The attack occurs from the face opposite to the leaving group (the epoxide oxygen).\n    *   Since the epoxide oxygen is 'up' (β), the nucleophile (Me⁻) must attack C6 from the 'down' (α) face. This is called a backside attack.\n    *   The C6-O bond breaks. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1, and after an aqueous workup (which is standard and assumed), it becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The configuration at C6 is inverted.\n\n**4. Predict the Product Structure**\n\n1.  **Attack:** Me⁻ attacks C6 from the 'down' (α) side. A new C-Me bond is formed at C6, and this Me group is oriented 'down' (α).\n2.  **Ring Opening:** The C6-O bond breaks, and an alkoxide is formed at C1. The oxygen atom stays 'up' (β). Protonation during workup gives an -OH group that is 'up' (β).\n3.  **Inversion:** The initial configuration at C6 was (S). Due to the Sₙ2 attack, the configuration of this carbon center is inverted to (R).\n4.  **Unaffected Centers:** The configurations of the chiral centers not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) remain unchanged.\n5.  **Numbering the Product:** The product is a substituted cyclohexanol. According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1.\n    *   Our old C1 is the new C1.\n    *   To give the methyl substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants), we number the ring in the direction C1 → C6(old) → C5(old) ...\n    *   New C1 = old C1\n    *   New C2 = old C6 (where the attack occurred)\n    *   New C4 = old C4\n    *   New C5 = old C3\n    *   The substituents are four methyl groups and one hydroxyl group. The name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and D.\n6.  **Determining the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   **New C1:** The configuration was (R) and is unchanged. So, it is **1R**.\n    *   **New C2 (from old C6):** The configuration was (S) and was inverted. So, it is **2R**.\n    *   **New C4 (from old C4):** The configuration was (R) and is unchanged. So, it is **4R**.\n    *   **New C5 (from old C3):** The configuration was (R) and is unchanged. So, it is **5R**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
