    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\nFirst, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about the presence of rings or double/triple bonds.\nThe formula for DoU is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   C = 9 (number of carbons)\n*   H = 11 (number of hydrogens)\n*   N = 1 (number of nitrogens)\n\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) plus one additional degree of unsaturation, which is likely a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands in the N-H stretching region is characteristic of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches, respectively.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester** (R-COO-R'). An amide C=O would typically appear at a lower frequency (e.g., 1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\nConclusion from IR: The molecule contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are four protons on a benzene ring, indicating it is disubstituted.\n    *   **Splitting (d, d):** The pattern of two doublets is classic for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The large chemical shift difference (1.0 ppm) between the two sets of protons suggests one substituent is a strong electron-donating group (EDG) and the other is a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG). The primary amine (-NH₂) is an EDG, and the ester (-COOR) is an EWG. The protons ortho to the EDG are shielded (upfield, ~7.0 ppm), and the protons ortho to the EWG are deshielded (downfield, ~8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This triplet-quartet pair is the signature pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The methyl group (-CH₃) at 1.20 ppm is a triplet because it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group (2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   The methylene group (-CH₂) at 4.5 ppm is a quartet because it is adjacent to a -CH₃ group (3+1=4 peaks).\n    *   The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates the -CH₂- group is bonded to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen atom. This confirms an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to 2H is characteristic of the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. Broadening is common for amine protons due to chemical exchange and nitrogen's quadrupolar moment. The chemical shift is consistent with an aniline-type amine.\n\n**4. Final Structure Determination**\n\nPutting all the pieces together:\n*   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   The substituents are a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThe only structure that fits this description is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check the other options:\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The propionate group's -CH₂- (next to the C=O) would appear as a quartet around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would give a single N-H IR stretch, and its C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency. It would also lack the two -NH₂ protons.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted ring, which would produce a more complex NMR splitting pattern, not two clean doublets. Its amide C=O would also be at a lower IR frequency.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
