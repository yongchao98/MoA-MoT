    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is a single `1H` peak at 7 ppm and two `13C` peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   A single `1H` peak at 7 ppm for a *cis*-alkene suggests two equivalent vinylic protons. The high chemical shift is due to deshielding by electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   Two `13C` peaks suggest a high degree of symmetry. One peak at ~137 ppm is typical for an alkene carbon, and one at ~165 ppm is typical for a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride.\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent alkene protons (H-C=C-H) and two sets of equivalent carbons (the two alkene carbons and the two carbonyl carbons), and its structure is derived from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid (maleic acid).\n    *   **Diene:** **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system. Methyl groups are located at all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4). The C5 carbon is a CH2 group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder cycloaddition** between the diene and the dienophile. This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The resulting skeleton is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene system.\n    *   The product has the molecular formula C13H16O3, which is consistent with the adduct of C9H14 (diene) and C4H2O3 (dienophile).\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. The problem states that two products, major and minor, are formed, which corresponds to these isomers.\n\n3.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products (*Endo* vs. *Exo*):**\n    *   According to the **Alder endo rule**, the *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored (major) product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene and the dienophile's substituents.\n    *   However, this rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance. In our diene, there are methyl groups on the C2 and C3 positions. In the *endo* transition state, the anhydride ring of the dienophile would be forced underneath these methyl groups, leading to significant steric clash.\n    *   Therefore, the *exo* transition state, which avoids this clash, is lower in energy. This is a classic example of **steric control overriding electronic preference**.\n    *   Conclusion: **Major Product = *Exo* isomer; Minor Product = *Endo* isomer.**\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structures and Proton Proximity for NOESY:**\n    *   **NOESY** (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Ã…). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons.\n    *   The question describes a cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* isomer but far apart in the *endo* isomer.\n    *   Let's identify the key protons and assign their likely chemical shifts based on the options:\n        *   **Me_vinyl:** The two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C5=C6). 6H singlet, vinylic methyl, **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **H_anhydride:** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring (at C2 and C3). 2H singlet, alpha to carbonyls, **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Me_bridgehead:** The two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). 6H singlet, methyl on quaternary carbon, **~1 ppm**.\n\n5.  **Relate Proximity to the Isomer Structures:**\n    *   **Major Product (*Exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C7 (CH2) bridge. This geometry forces the two `H_anhydride` protons into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system. These *endo* protons point \"up\" into the cage, directly towards the C5=C6 double bond where the `Me_vinyl` groups are located. Thus, `H_anhydride` and `Me_vinyl` are close in space. **A NOESY cross-peak is expected.**\n\n    *   **Minor Product (*Endo* isomer):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. The two `H_anhydride` protons are in the *exo* position, pointing \"down\" and away from the cage and the C5=C6 double bond. In this configuration, `H_anhydride` and `Me_vinyl` are far apart. **A NOESY cross-peak is not expected (or would be very weak).**\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The observation of a strong cross-peak in the major product and its absence in the minor product perfectly matches the interaction between `H_anhydride` and `Me_vinyl`.\n    *   This corresponds to the resonances:\n        *   A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_vinyl`)\n        *   A 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_anhydride`)\n    *   This matches option C.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   A) Me_bridgehead (~1 ppm) vs Me_vinyl (~1.7 ppm): Their relative position doesn't change significantly between isomers. This NOE, if it exists, should be in both.\n*   B) H_C7 (~1.5 ppm) vs H_anhydride (~3.5 ppm): This NOE would also be present in the major (*exo*) and absent in the minor (*endo*). However, the signal for the C7 protons would be a complex AB quartet (two 1H multiplets), not a simple 1H doublet, and the interaction between the 6 protons of the methyl groups and the 2 anhydride protons (Option C) would likely give a much more prominent cross-peak than one involving a single C7 proton.\n*   D) Me_bridgehead (~1 ppm) vs H_C7 (~1.5 ppm): The NOE between these should not depend strongly on the *endo*/*exo* configuration of the distant anhydride ring.\n\nTherefore, the most logical and definitive answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
