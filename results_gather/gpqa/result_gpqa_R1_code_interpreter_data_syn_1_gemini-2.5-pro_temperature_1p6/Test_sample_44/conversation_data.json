    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System and Fundamental Principles:**\n    *   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are fermions.\n    *   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** This principle is crucial for fermions. It states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin quantum number `ms` (which can be spin up, `ms = +1/2`, or spin down, `ms = -1/2`).\n    *   **State Occupancy:** Because of the two possible spin states, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two fermions: one spin up and one spin down.\n    *   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n\n2.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n    *   The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are given by the formula:\n        E_n = (n^2 * π² * ħ²) / (2 * m * L²)\n        where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n    *   The problem defines a base energy unit E = (π² * ħ²) / (2 * m * L²).\n    *   Therefore, we can express the single-particle energy levels as:\n        E_n = n² * E\n        *   E₁ = 1² * E = 1E\n        *   E₂ = 2² * E = 4E\n        *   E₃ = 3² * E = 9E\n        *   E₄ = 4² * E = 16E\n        *   and so on.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    *   To find the ground state of the four-particle system, we must fill the lowest available energy levels, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   **Level n=1:** This is the lowest energy level (1E). We can place two fermions here (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   **Level n=2:** This is the next lowest energy level (4E). We place the remaining two fermions here.\n    *   **Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, and two particles in n=2.\n    *   **Total Energy:**\n        E_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂)\n        E_ground = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n4.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st_excited):**\n    *   The first excited state is the lowest-energy configuration possible above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   **Ground State Configuration:** Particles are in n=1 and n=2.\n    *   **Highest Occupied Level:** n=2.\n    *   **Lowest Unoccupied Level:** n=3.\n    *   **Promotion:** Move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   **New Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   **Total Energy:**\n        E_1st_excited = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\n        E_1st_excited = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd_excited):**\n    *   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible promotions from the ground state that would result in a higher energy than the first excited state.\n    *   **Possibility A: Promote a particle from a lower level.** Move one particle from n=1 to the lowest empty level n=3.\n        *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, one particle in n=3.\n        *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n    *   **Possibility B: Promote two particles.** Move the two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=3.\n        *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n    *   **Possibility C: Promote one particle to a higher level.** Move one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n        *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n    *   Comparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is the first excited state (15E), and the next lowest is 18E.\n    *   Therefore, E_2nd_excited = 18E.\n\nTo confirm the enumeration of states and their energies, a computational approach can be used to systematically find all configurations of 4 particles distributed among the energy levels (with a maximum of 2 per level) and sort them by energy.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef calculate_energy(config):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the total energy for a given particle configuration.\"\"\"\n    energy = 0\n    for i, occupancy in enumerate(config):\n        n = i + 1  # Principal quantum number\n        energy += occupancy * (n**2)\n    return energy\n\n# Consider configurations across the first 6 energy levels\n# Each level can have 0, 1, or 2 particles.\npossible_occupancies = [0, 1, 2]\nnum_levels = 6\n\n# Generate all possible configurations of occupancies\nall_configs = itertools.product(possible_occupancies, repeat=num_levels)\n\n# Filter for configurations with exactly 4 particles\nvalid_configs = [config for config in all_configs if sum(config) == 4]\n\n# Calculate the energy for each valid configuration and store unique energies\nunique_energies = set()\nfor config in valid_configs:\n    energy = calculate_energy(config)\n    unique_energies.add(energy)\n\n# Sort the unique energies in ascending order\nsorted_energies = sorted(list(unique_energies))\n\n# The first three energies are the ground state, first excited, and second excited states\nground_state = sorted_energies[0]\nfirst_excited = sorted_energies[1]\nsecond_excited = sorted_energies[2]\n\nprint(f\"The sequence of lowest energies are {ground_state}E, {first_excited}E, {second_excited}E.\")\n```\n<execute_code>\ne-1_rerun_execution_for_all_cells\n</execute_code>\n[execution_results]\nstdout:\nThe sequence of lowest energies are 10E, 15E, 18E.\n[/execution_results]\n\nThe code confirms the manual calculation.\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFor a particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L, the energy levels are quantized:\n$E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere *n* is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   ...and so on.\n\n**2. Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. In this system, a quantum state is defined by both the energy level *n* and the spin state (spin-up or spin-down). This means that each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n**3. Ground State Energy ($E_{ground}$)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli principle.\n*   **Level n=1:** Can hold 2 particles.\n*   **Level n=2:** Can hold 2 particles.\n\nWe place two particles in the n=1 level and the remaining two particles in the n=2 level.\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$)**\n\nThe first excited state is formed by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   **Ground state configuration:** Particles occupy n=1 and n=2.\n*   **Highest occupied level:** n=2.\n*   **Lowest unoccupied level:** n=3.\n\nWe promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\nThe new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)**\n\nThe second excited state is the next possible energy level above the first excited state. We need to find the next-lowest energy configuration. Let's examine the possibilities for exciting from the ground state:\n*   **Promotion 1 (already used for 1st excited state):** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3. Energy = 15E.\n*   **Promotion 2:** Move one particle from the lower n=1 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   Configuration: one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n*   **Promotion 3:** Move both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: two particles in n=1, two particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\nComparing the energies of the possible excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, ...), the lowest is 15E (first excited state) and the next lowest is 18E.\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Ground State Energy = 10E\n*   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n*   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
