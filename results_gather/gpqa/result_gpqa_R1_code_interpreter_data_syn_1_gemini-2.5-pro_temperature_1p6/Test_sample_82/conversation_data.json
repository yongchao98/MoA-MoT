    "Here is a breakdown of the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH):\n    *   `Moles = Concentration × Volume`\n    *   `Moles = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L` (since 20.00 cm³ = 0.02000 L)\n    *   `Moles = 0.00100 mol`\n*   Total volume after adding 20.00 cm³ of water:\n    *   `Total Volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L`\n*   New concentration of acetic acid:\n    *   `New Concentration = Moles / Total Volume`\n    *   `New Concentration = 0.00100 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M`\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO⁻), by reacting with NaOH. This creates a buffer solution.\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used for buffer solutions: `pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])`\n    *   `[HA]` is the concentration of the acid (CH3COOH).\n    *   `[A⁻]` is the concentration of the conjugate base (CH3COO⁻).\n*   First, calculate pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   `pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵)`\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid is:\n    *   `[A⁻]/[HA] = 25% / (100% - 25%) = 25% / 75% = 1/3`\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    *   `pH = pKa + log(1/3)`\n    *   `pH = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) - log(3)`\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH3COONa). The solution contains only the weak base, acetate (CH3COO⁻).\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water, producing OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic:\n    *   `CH3COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH⁻`\n*   First, determine the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point:\n    *   `Moles of acid = Moles of base`\n    *   `M_acid × V_acid = M_base × V_base`\n    *   `0.025 M × 40.00 cm³ = 0.1 M × V_base`\n    *   `V_base = (0.025 × 40.00) / 0.1 = 10.00 cm³`\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n    *   `Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (acid solution) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH solution) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L`\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([CH3COO⁻]) at the equivalence point. The moles of acetate are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid:\n    *   `[CH3COO⁻] = Initial moles of acid / Total volume at equivalence`\n    *   `[CH3COO⁻] = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M`\n*   Calculate Kb for the acetate ion:\n    *   `Kb = Kw / Ka`, where `Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴` at 25 °C.\n    *   `Kb = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵)`\n*   Set up the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis to find [OH⁻]:\n    *   `Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻]`\n    *   Assuming `[CH3COOH] = [OH⁻] = x`, and `[CH3COO⁻]` is approximately `0.02 M`:\n    *   `Kb = x² / 0.02`\n    *   `x = [OH⁻] = √(Kb × 0.02)`\n*   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n    *   `pOH = -log([OH⁻])`\n    *   `pH = 14.00 - pOH`\n\nTo perform these calculations accurately, the following Python script can be used.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nKa_acetic_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# Initial conditions\ninitial_conc_acid = 0.05  # M\ninitial_vol_acid = 0.02000 # L\ndilution_water_vol = 0.02000 # L\nconc_naoh = 0.1 # M\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate concentration after dilution ---\nmoles_acid = initial_conc_acid * initial_vol_acid\ntotal_volume_after_dilution = initial_vol_acid + dilution_water_vol\nconc_acid_after_dilution = moles_acid / total_volume_after_dilution\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate pH at 25% titration ---\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acetic_acid)\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] ratio is 0.25/0.75\nratio_25_percent = 0.25 / 0.75\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio_25_percent)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate pH at equivalence point ---\n# Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence point\nvol_naoh_for_equivalence = moles_acid / conc_naoh\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_volume_at_equivalence = total_volume_after_dilution + vol_naoh_for_equivalence\n\n# Concentration of acetate (conjugate base) at equivalence point\nconc_acetate_at_equivalence = moles_acid / total_volume_at_equivalence\n\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb_acetate = Kw / Ka_acetic_acid\n\n# Calculate [OH-] concentration from hydrolysis of acetate\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [Acetate]  => [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [Acetate])\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb_acetate * conc_acetate_at_equivalence)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_at_equivalence = 14.00 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"{pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"{pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n4.26\n8.52\n<<<B>>>",
    "### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Understand the initial state:** We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH). We then dilute this solution by adding 20.00 cm³ of water.\n\n2.  **Calculate the new concentration of acetic acid after dilution:**\n    *   First, find the initial moles of acetic acid.\n        *   Volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³ = 0.02000 L\n        *   Concentration (M₁) = 0.05 mol/L\n        *   Initial moles = M₁ × V₁ = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.00100 mol CH₃COOH\n    *   Next, find the total volume after adding water.\n        *   Final Volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n    *   Finally, calculate the new concentration of the diluted acid (M₂).\n        *   M₂ = Initial moles / V₂ = 0.00100 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH at 25% titration:**\n    *   \"25% titration\" means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   At this point, we have a buffer solution containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   The relative amounts are:\n        *   CH₃COOH remaining = 100% - 25% = 75%\n        *   CH₃COO⁻ formed = 25%\n    *   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n        *   [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate).\n        *   [HA] is the concentration of the acid (acetic acid).\n    *   First, calculate pKa:\n        *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n        *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n    *   Now, calculate the pH:\n        *   The ratio of concentrations `[A⁻]/[HA]` is the same as the ratio of their moles, which is `25% / 75% = 1/3`.\n        *   pH = pKa + log(1/3) = 4.73 + log(0.333) = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253\n        *   Rounding gives a pH of **4.26**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH at the equivalence point:**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.00100 mol) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (0.00100 mol).

We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n        *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Set up the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\n        *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n        *   Let [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH] = x\n        *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / 0.02\n        *   x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n        *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n    *   Calculate pOH and then pH.\n        *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\n*   The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe code execution below confirms these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nKa_acetic_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Part 1: Dilution Calculation ---\n# Initial conditions\ninitial_conc_acid = 0.05  # M\ninitial_vol_acid = 0.02000 # L (20.00 cm^3)\n\n# Calculate initial moles of acetic acid\nmoles_acid = initial_conc_acid * initial_vol_acid\n\n# Calculate new volume and concentration after adding 20.00 cm^3 (0.02000 L) of water\ntotal_volume_after_dilution = initial_vol_acid + 0.02000 # L\nconc_acid_after_dilution = moles_acid / total_volume_after_dilution\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at 25% Titration ---\n# Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acetic_acid)\nratio_at_25_percent = 0.25 / 0.75\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio_at_25_percent)\n\n# --- Part 3: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# At the equivalence point, all acid is converted to its conjugate base, acetate.\n# Concentration of NaOH titrant\nconc_naoh = 0.1 # M\n\n# Volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence\nvol_naoh_for_equivalence = moles_acid / conc_naoh\n\n# Total volume at the equivalence point\ntotal_volume_at_equivalence = total_volume_after_dilution + vol_naoh_for_equivalence\n\n# Concentration of the acetate ion [A-] at equivalence\nconc_acetate_at_equivalence = moles_acid / total_volume_at_equivalence\n\n# Acetate hydrolyzes water: A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-\n# We need Kb for acetate\nKb_acetate = Kw / Ka_acetic_acid\n\n# Calculate [OH-] concentration using Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-]\n# Assume [OH-] = x, so Kb = x^2 / [A-]\n# x = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb_acetate * conc_acetate_at_equivalence)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH_at_equivalence = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_at_equivalence = 14.00 - pOH_at_equivalence\n\nprint(f\"{pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"{pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n4.26\n8.52\n<<<B>>>",
