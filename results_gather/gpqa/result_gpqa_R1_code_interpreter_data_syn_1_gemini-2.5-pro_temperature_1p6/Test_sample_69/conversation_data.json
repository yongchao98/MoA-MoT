    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues for Known Chemical Patterns**\n\n    *   **Clue 3: Hydrolysis.** \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\" This is the most chemically specific clue. We are looking for a substance (related to B) that hydrolyzes to produce one strong and one weak acid.\n        *   **Possibility 1:** N₂O₄ (from NO₂ gas) + H₂O → HNO₃ (strong) + HNO₂ (weak). This is an excellent chemical fit. So, B could be NO₂.\n        *   **Possibility 2:** Cl₂ + H₂O → HCl (strong) + HOCl (hypochlorous acid, weak). This is also an excellent fit. So, B could be Cl₂.\n        *   **Possibility 3:** ClF₅ + 3H₂O → HClO₃ (strong) + 5HF (weak). This also works. So, B could be ClF₅.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: Solvent Formation.** \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\"\n        *   Let's test our possibilities for B.\n        *   If B = NO₂, then D(g) + NO₂(g) → H(solvent). A known reaction is NO(g) + NO₂(g) ⇌ N₂O₃. Dinitrogen trioxide (N₂O₃) is a deep-blue liquid (b.p. 3 °C), so it can be a solvent. This path seems consistent (D=NO).\n        *   If B = Cl₂, then D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent). A known reaction is CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(g/l). Phosgene (COCl₂) is a liquid below 8.2 °C and is used as a reagent and sometimes a solvent. This path is also consistent (D=CO, H=COCl₂).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Two Main Hypotheses**\n\n    *   **Hypothesis I: Nitrogen Chemistry**\n        *   B = NO₂, D = NO, H = N₂O₃.\n        *   This would mean Reaction 2 is: C + 2NO(g) → E (extremely hazardous).\n        *   And Reaction 1 is: A(s) + 8NO₂(g) → C(bright red).\n        *   This path has issues. Finding a real reaction for A + 8NO₂ → C that fits all criteria, especially the regeneration of A from C's hydrolysis, is very difficult.\n\n    *   **Hypothesis II: Chlorine Chemistry**\n        *   B = Cl₂, D = CO, H = COCl₂ (phosgene).\n        *   This looks promising. Let's explore it fully.\n        *   **A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → C(bright red):** The 1:8 stoichiometry is highly unusual and might be a typo or a red herring, common in such puzzles. Let's look for a reaction between a solid A and chlorine gas (B) that produces a red product (C). Gold (Au) is a solid that reacts with chlorine to form gold(III) chloride (AuCl₃, or Au₂Cl₆ dimer), which is a red solid. The actual stoichiometry is 2Au + 3Cl₂ → 2AuCl₃. Let's tentatively accept A = Au and C = AuCl₃, assuming the '8' is incorrect.\n        *   **C + 2D(g) → E (extremely hazardous):** This becomes AuCl₃ + 2CO(g) → E. The reaction of AuCl₃ with CO is known to produce phosgene (COCl₂) and other products. For example: AuCl₃ + 2CO → Au(CO)Cl + COCl₂. Here, **E** is **COCl₂ (phosgene)**. Phosgene is famously an extremely hazardous chemical agent, fitting the description perfectly.\n        *   **C + H₂O → A + F + G:** This is the hydrolysis of AuCl₃. `AuCl₃ + 3H₂O → Au(OH)₃ + 3HCl`.\n            *   This produces a strong acid, **F = HCl**.\n            *   It also produces auric acid, **G = Au(OH)₃**, which is a weak acid.\n            *   Does it \"reform A\"? Not directly. It produces Au(OH)₃, which can be easily reduced back to gold metal (Au). In the context of a chemical riddle, this is often considered \"reforming\". This hypothesis, while not perfect, is remarkably consistent.\n\n3.  **Identify E and Determine its Molecular Symmetry**\n\n    *   Based on the most consistent hypothesis, the extremely hazardous product **E** is **phosgene (COCl₂)**.\n    *   Now, we need to find the molecular symmetry group of phosgene.\n\n```python\n# To determine the point group of phosgene (COCl2), we analyze its symmetry elements.\n# The molecule has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n# It is a planar molecule.\n# 1. Identity (E): All molecules have this.\n# 2. Rotation axis (Cn): There is a C2 axis passing through the C and O atoms, bisecting the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n# 3. Mirror planes (σ):\n#    - There is a mirror plane (σv) that is coplanar with the molecule itself.\n#    - There is another mirror plane (σ'v) that is perpendicular to the molecular plane and contains the C2 axis.\n# 4. Inversion center (i): It does not have a center of inversion.\n# 5. Improper rotation axis (Sn): It does not have an S_n axis other than S1=σ and S2=i.\n# The combination of a C2 axis and two perpendicular mirror planes (σv) containing that axis defines the C2v point group.\n\nprint(\"The point group for Phosgene (COCl2) is C2v.\")\n```\n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n\n    The analysis points to E being phosgene (COCl₂). The molecular structure of phosgene is planar with a C₂ axis of rotation and two perpendicular mirror planes containing the axis. This corresponds to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nFinal Answer matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "*   **Step 1: Analyze Clue 3**\n    *   Clue 3 states: \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\"\n    *   This hydrolysis reaction yielding a strong and a weak acid is a very distinctive chemical fingerprint. A common example is the hydrolysis of interhalogen compounds or mixed oxides.\n    *   Let's consider the reaction: Cl₂ + H₂O ⇌ HCl + HOCl. Here, HCl is a strong acid (F) and HOCl (hypochlorous acid) is a weak acid (G). This suggests that Cl₂ gas might be involved. Let's tentatively identify **Gas B as Cl₂**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Clue 4 using the identity of B**\n    *   Clue 4 states: \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\"\n    *   If B is Cl₂, the reaction is: D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent).\n    *   A well-known industrial reaction fits this description perfectly: CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l/g).\n    *   This identifies **Gas D as CO (carbon monoxide)** and **H as COCl₂ (phosgene)**. Phosgene is a liquid below 8.2 °C and has been used as a specialty solvent.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze Clue 2 to identify E**\n    *   Clue 2 states: \"When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"\n    *   Using our identification of D=CO, the reaction is: C + 2CO → E (extremely hazardous).\n    *   We know that phosgene (COCl₂) is an extremely hazardous substance. A plausible reaction is one where C is a metal chloride that acts as a chlorine source, reacting with CO to produce phosgene. For example, the reaction of gold(III) chloride with carbon monoxide: AuCl₃ + 2CO → Au(CO)Cl + COCl₂.\n    *   This strongly suggests that the hazardous product **E is Phosgene (COCl₂)**. This also fits with H being phosgene, as a substance can be both a product and a solvent in different contexts.\n\n*   **Step 4: Confirm the identities of A and C**\n    *   Let's assume the reaction in Step 3 is correct. Then C would be AuCl₃.\n    *   Clue 1: \"reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C\". The reaction would be A(s) + Cl₂(g) → AuCl₃. This implies **A is Au (Gold)** and **C is AuCl₃ (Gold(III) chloride)**. Gold is a solid, and AuCl₃ is a bright red solid, fitting the description. (Note: The stoichiometry 2Au + 3Cl₂ → 2AuCl₃ doesn't match the 1:8 ratio given, which is a common feature in such puzzles to act as a distractor. The chemical properties provide the primary path to the solution).\n    *   Let's re-check the hydrolysis in Clue 3: AuCl₃ + 3H₂O → Au(OH)₃ + 3HCl.\n        *   This produces F = HCl (a strong acid) and G = Au(OH)₃ (auric acid, a weak acid).\n        *   It also produces Au(OH)₃, which can be readily converted back to gold metal (A), thus \"reforming A\". All clues are now consistent.\n\n*   **Step 5: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n    *   We have identified **E as phosgene (COCl₂)**.\n    *   To find its molecular symmetry group (point group), we analyze its structure.\n    *   Phosgene has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. VSEPR theory predicts a trigonal planar geometry.\n    *   The symmetry elements are:\n        1.  A C₂ rotational axis that passes through the C=O double bond.\n        2.  A mirror plane (σᵥ) that is coplanar with all four atoms.\n        3.  A second mirror plane (σ'ᵥ) that is perpendicular to the molecular plane and contains the C₂ axis.\n    *   A molecule with one C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes containing that axis belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) D∞h - Incorrect (for linear molecules with a center of inversion like CO₂)\nB) C₂v - Correct (for molecules like H₂O, SO₂, and COCl₂)\nC) D₄h - Incorrect (for square planar molecules like [PtCl₄]²⁻)\nD) C₂ - Incorrect (for chiral molecules with only a C₂ axis, like twisted H₂O₂)\n\nThus, the molecular symmetry group of E (phosgene) is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<B>>>"
