    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a Michael addition (or conjugate addition).\n    *   **Nucleophile Source:** The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, will be deprotonated by the base to form an enolate.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The base removes an acidic α-proton from the ketone. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon. It has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation must occur at the C6 position, forming the C1-C6 enolate. There is no ambiguity between kinetic and thermodynamic enolates as there is only one possible site for deprotonation.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the enolate (C6) attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the terminal carbon of the acrylate.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The original cyclohexanone ring remains intact.\n    *   C1: Carbonyl group (=O).\n    *   C2: Quaternary center with an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   C6: Becomes a quaternary center, now bonded to its original methyl group and the newly added `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` (2-ethoxycarbonylethyl) group.\n    *   The reaction can be summarized as:\n         \n\n5.  **Naming Product A:** The options name the product as a propanoate derivative. Let's follow this convention.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`. We number this chain starting from the ester carbonyl: `EtO-C(=O)(1)-CH₂(2)-CH₂(3)-`.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring system is a substituent on C3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment on the substituent ring is numbered C-1'. Let's renumber the ring. The old C6 (the point of attack) is now C-1'.\n    *   Following the ring from C-1' (old C6) to C-2' (old C1), we find the ketone's carbonyl group. So there is a `2-oxo` substituent.\n    *   C-1' (old C6) also has a methyl group, so there's a `1-methyl` substituent.\n    *   C-3' (old C2) has an ethyl group and a methyl group, so there are `3-ethyl` and `3-methyl` substituents.\n    *   Combining these, the name is: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   This name matches the structure for A given in options B and C.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is also a Michael addition.\n    *   **Nucleophile Source:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) has acidic α-protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the 1-nitropropane.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as (E)-crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   KOH removes a proton from the α-carbon (C1) of 1-nitropropane to form a nitronate anion, `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`, which is a potent carbon nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (the CH carbon bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new C-C bond is formed. After workup with H₂O, the intermediate enamine-like species is protonated at the α-carbon to yield the final nitrile product.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   Let's connect the two pieces:\n        *   From 1-nitropropane: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)–`\n        *   From but-2-enenitrile: `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`\n    *   Combined structure: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (–CN), so the parent chain is a `...nitrile`.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        `CN(1)–CH₂(2)–CH(CH₃)(3)–CH(NO₂)(4)–CH₂(5)–CH₃(6)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   The substituents on this chain are: a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The IUPAC name is: `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n    *   This name matches the structure for B given in options C and D.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   Option A: A is wrong, B is wrong.\n*   Option B: A is correct, B is wrong.\n*   **Option C: A is correct, B is correct.**\n*   Option D: A is wrong, B is correct.\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
