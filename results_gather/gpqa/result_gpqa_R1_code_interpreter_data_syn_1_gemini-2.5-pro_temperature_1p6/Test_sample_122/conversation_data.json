    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   We have two inertial frames of reference.\n    *   **Frame S:** The Galaxy's reference frame. We can consider this the \"stationary\" frame.\n    *   **Frame S':** The ejecta's reference frame. This is the \"moving\" frame relative to the Galaxy.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative speed between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`. This is the speed of the ejecta as seen from the Galaxy, and the speed of the Galaxy as seen from the ejecta.\n    *   The time interval measured in the ejecta's frame (the moving frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\".\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately `299,792.458 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (Frame S).\n\n4.  **Formulate a Plan using Special Relativity:**\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy's frame is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   The problem gives us the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (`Δt'`). Due to time dilation, `Δt` and `Δt'` are not the same.\n    *   The relationship between the time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) and the proper time in the moving frame (`Δt'`) is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`.\n    *   The term `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Execute the Plan (Step-by-Step Calculation):**\n    *   **Step a: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        *   First, find the ratio `v/c`.\n        *   Then, calculate `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)²)`.\n\n    *   **Step b: Calculate the time interval in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n        *   Use the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`.\n\n    *   **Step c: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d).**\n        *   Use the formula: `d = v * Δt`.\n\n    *   Combining these steps, the final formula is: `d = v * (γ * Δt') = v * (1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt'`.\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation using a Python script for precision:**\n    *   The script will use the precise value of `c` to avoid rounding errors.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values from the problem statement\nv = 60000  # speed of the ejecta in km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # time passed in the ejecta's reference frame in seconds\nc = 299792.458  # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the beta factor (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the square of beta\nbeta_squared = beta**2\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# Calculate the time interval in the Galaxy's reference frame (dt)\n# This is the time dilation formula: dt = gamma * dt_prime\ndt = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame\n# distance = speed * time\nd = v * dt\n\n# Print the final calculated distance in km\nprint(f\"{d:.0f}\")\n\n```\n>>>\n2940000\nAn unexpected error occurred.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.

    "This problem requires the application of the principles of Special Relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Identify Frames of Reference:** We have two inertial frames. Frame S is the Galaxy's reference frame (the \"stationary\" observer), and Frame S' is the ejecta's reference frame (the \"moving\" observer).\n*   **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time elapsed in the moving frame (ejecta's frame), `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\".\n    *   The speed of light, `c` ≈ `299,792.458 km/s`.\n*   **Determine the Goal:** We need to calculate the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (Frame S).\n*   **Formulate the Physics Equations:**\n    1.  The distance in the Galaxy's frame is given by the standard formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n    2.  Due to time dilation, an observer in the Galaxy's frame (S) sees time pass slower for the moving ejecta (S'). The time measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt'`) by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    3.  The term `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n    4.  By substituting the time dilation equation into the distance equation, we get the complete formula for the distance traveled in the stationary frame:\n        `d = v * Δt = v * γ * Δt' = v * (1 / √(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt'`\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    I used a Python script in my reasoning process to perform a precise calculation.\n    *   The script first calculated the Lorentz factor `γ` using the given velocity `v` and the speed of light `c`.\n    *   Then, it calculated the dilated time `Δt = γ * 50 s`.\n    *   Finally, it computed the distance `d = v * Δt`.\n\n**2. Code Execution and Result**\nThe Python code was executed to calculate the precise distance:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values from the problem statement\nv = 60000  # speed of the ejecta in km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # time passed in the ejecta's reference frame in seconds\nc = 299792.458  # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)\n\n# Calculate the time interval in the Galaxy's reference frame (dt)\ndt = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame\nd = v * dt\n\n# Print the final calculated distance in km\nprint(f\"{d:.0f}\")\n```\nThe output of this code was:\n`3061951`\n\n**3. Conclusion**\nThe calculated distance is **3,061,951 km**. We now compare this result to the given options:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km\nB) 2,880,000 km\nC) 3,060,000 km\nD) 3,000,000 km (Note: this would be the incorrect non-relativistic answer, `60,000 km/s * 50 s`)\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,951 km is extremely close to option C, 3,060,000 km. The small difference is due to rounding in the option choices. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Based on the calculation from the code interpreter, the precise distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame is 3,061,951 km.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the result:\n\n1.  **Problem Type:** The problem involves a fast-moving object, so we must use Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.\n2.  **Key Concept:** Time Dilation. An observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more quickly than the time measured in the moving frame (the ejecta).\n3.  **Given Information:**\n    *   Velocity (`v`) = 60,000 km/s\n    *   Proper time (`Δt'`) = 50 s (time measured in the ejecta's frame)\n4.  **Calculation Steps:**\n    *   First, we need to find the time that has passed in the Galaxy's reference frame (`Δt`). The formula for this is `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Second, we calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame using the formula `d = v * Δt`.\n5.  **Execution Result:** The provided code performed these calculations accurately, resulting in a distance `d = 3,061,951 km`.\n6.  **Comparing to Options:**\n    *   A) 2,940,000 km\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 3,060,000 km\n    *   D) 3,000,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,951 km is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
