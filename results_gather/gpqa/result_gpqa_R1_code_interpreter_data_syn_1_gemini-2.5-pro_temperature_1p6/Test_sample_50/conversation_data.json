    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Method**\n\nThe system consists of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (`d > R`). Since the sphere is a conductor, the presence of the charge `q` will induce charges on the surface of the sphere. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to a charge reservoir (the Earth) and its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0).\n\nThe problem can be solved using the **Method of Images**. This powerful technique allows us to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the conductor's surface with one or more fictitious \"image charges\". The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere in the original problem are identical to the field and potential created by the original charge `q` and a carefully chosen image charge `q'`.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge and its Position**\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the sphere can be replaced by a single image charge `q'` placed at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`. The values of `q'` and `b` are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero.\n\nThe standard results for this configuration are:\n*   The image charge is: `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n*   The position of the image charge from the center is: `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located inside the sphere, as `d > R` implies `b < R`.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`, while the sphere remains grounded.\n\n`U = W_external = ∫_∞^d F_external ⋅ dx`\n\nThe external force `F_external` is equal and opposite to the electrostatic force `F_elec` exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`.\n`F_external = -F_elec`\n\nSo, `U = -∫_∞^d F_elec ⋅ dx`\n\nThe electrostatic force on the charge `q` at any position `x` from the center is due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is exactly the same as the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)` at position `b(x)`.\n\nAt an arbitrary position `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` and its position is `b(x) = R^2/x`. The distance between the charge `q` (at `x`) and its image `q'(x)` (at `b(x)`) is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n\nThe electrostatic force is:\n`F_elec(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`\n`F_elec(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n`F_elec(x) = -k * q^2 * R / x * 1 / ((x^2 - R^2)/x)^2`\n`F_elec(x) = -k * q^2 * R / x * x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n`F_elec(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow we can calculate the potential energy by integrating:\n`U = - ∫_∞^d [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n`U = k * q^2 * R ∫_∞^d [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, which gives `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du / 2`.\nThe integral becomes:\n`∫ [1 / u^2] * (du / 2) = (1/2) ∫ u^(-2) du = (1/2) * (-u^(-1)) = -1 / (2u)`\nSubstituting back for `u`:\n`∫ [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = -1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral for `U`:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2))]_∞^d`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2 * (∞^2 - R^2)))]`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))) - 0]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Alternative Method**\n\nThe interaction energy of a system of charges can be given by `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all other charges.\nFor our system, we have the charge `q` and the grounded sphere (where V=0). The energy is the interaction energy between `q` and the induced surface charge.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\nHere, `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` (at `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere. This potential is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\nThe distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n`V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nSubstituting this into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nBoth methods give the same result.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated net potential energy is `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
