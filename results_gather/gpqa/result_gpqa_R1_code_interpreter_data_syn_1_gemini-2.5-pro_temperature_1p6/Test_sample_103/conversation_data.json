    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1, which can be written as $T_2 / T_1$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Provided Information:**\n    *   We have two star-planet systems.\n    *   Star masses are equal: $M_{s1} = M_{s2} = M_s$.\n    *   Planet masses are similar (\"similar to that of Neptune\"): We assume they are equal, so $m_{p1} = m_{p2} = m_p$.\n    *   The stars' masses are \"similar to that of our Sun,\" which confirms that the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($m_p \\ll M_s$).\n    *   Both planets are in circular orbits.\n    *   The detection method is the Radial Velocity (RV) method, which measures the Doppler shift of the star's light.\n    *   The maximum wavelength shift for system #1 is $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ mÅ.\n    *   The maximum wavelength shift for system #2 is $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ mÅ.\n\n3.  **Relate Observations to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The Doppler shift formula is $\\Delta\\lambda / \\lambda_0 = v_{rad} / c$, where $v_{rad}$ is the star's radial velocity (velocity along the line of sight) and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   The maximum wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star. This maximum velocity is the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, denoted by $K$.\n    *   Therefore, $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n    *   From the given data, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n        $K_1 / K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2 = 5 / 7$.\n\n4.  **Derive the Relationship between RV Semi-amplitude ($K$) and Orbital Period ($T$):**\n    *   For a star of mass $M_s$ with a planet of mass $m_p$ in a circular orbit, the star itself orbits the common center of mass (barycenter). The observed RV semi-amplitude is the star's orbital speed projected onto the line of sight: $K = v_s \\sin(i)$, where $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n    *   The star's orbital speed is $v_s = \\frac{2\\pi a_s}{T}$, where $a_s$ is the radius of the star's orbit around the barycenter.\n    *   The position of the barycenter is defined by $M_s a_s = m_p a_p$, where $a_p$ is the planet's orbital radius. The semi-major axis of the planet's orbit relative to the star is $a = a_s + a_p$.\n    *   From these, we can express the star's orbital radius as $a_s = \\frac{m_p}{M_s + m_p} a$.\n    *   Since $m_p \\ll M_s$, we can approximate $M_s + m_p \\approx M_s$, so $a_s \\approx \\frac{m_p}{M_s} a$.\n    *   Substituting this into the expression for $v_s$: $v_s \\approx \\frac{2\\pi a}{T} \\frac{m_p}{M_s}$.\n    *   Now we need to relate the semi-major axis $a$ to the period $T$ using Kepler's Third Law:\n        $T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M_s + m_p)} a^3$.\n    *   Again, using the approximation $m_p \\ll M_s$: $T^2 \\approx \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M_s} a^3$.\n    *   From this, we can express $a$ in terms of $T$: $a \\propto (M_s T^2)^{1/3}$. Since $M_s$ is the same for both stars, we have $a \\propto T^{2/3}$.\n    *   Now substitute this back into the expression for $v_s$:\n        $v_s \\propto \\frac{a}{T} \\propto \\frac{T^{2/3}}{T} = T^{-1/3}$.\n    *   Since $K \\propto v_s$, we get the key relationship: $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$. This means that for two systems with identical masses and inclination, their RV semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of their orbital period. A larger period leads to a smaller RV signal.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Periods:**\n    *   We have the relationship $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$, which means $K \\cdot T^{1/3} = \\text{constant}$.\n    *   Therefore, for our two systems: $K_1 T_1^{1/3} = K_2 T_2^{1/3}$.\n    *   We want to find $T_2 / T_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n        $\\frac{T_2^{1/3}}{T_1^{1/3}} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n        $\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n    *   Cubing both sides gives:\n        $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$.\n    *   Substitute the known ratio of the K-amplitudes:\n        $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$.\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    *   We will use a short Python script to compute the value of $(5/7)^3$.\n\n```python\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.36443148688046646\n</execute_code>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.364. Comparing this to the options:\n\nA) ~ 0.36\nB) ~ 0.85\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to determine the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1, denoted as $T_2/T_1$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Provided Data:**\n    *   Two star-planet systems.\n    *   The masses of the stars are identical: $M_{s1} = M_{s2} = M_s$.\n    *   The masses of the planets are also identical: $m_{p1} = m_{p2} = m_p$.\n    *   The method of detection is Radial Velocity (RV), which measures the Doppler shift in the star's light caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet.\n    *   The maximum periodic wavelength shift for star #1 is $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom (mÅ).\n    *   The maximum periodic wavelength shift for star #2 is $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ mÅ.\n\n3.  **Relate Observables to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The Doppler shift formula is $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_{rad}}{c}$, where $v_{rad}$ is the star's velocity along the line of sight and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   The maximum measured wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum line-of-sight velocity of the star. This maximum velocity is known as the RV semi-amplitude, denoted by $K$.\n    *   Therefore, the RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift: $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n    *   This gives us the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes for the two stars:\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n4.  **Derive the Physical Relationship between RV Semi-amplitude ($K$) and Orbital Period ($T$):**\n    *   For a star in a circular orbit around the system's barycenter (center of mass), the RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n        $K = v_s \\sin(i)$, where $v_s$ is the orbital speed of the star and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit. Since the problem doesn't specify the inclination, we assume it's the same for both systems or that we are observing the maximum possible shift (i.e., edge-on view, where $\\sin(i)=1$).\n    *   The star's orbital speed is $v_s = \\frac{2\\pi a_s}{T}$, where $a_s$ is the radius of the star's orbit around the barycenter.\n    *   The relationship between the star's orbital radius ($a_s$) and the planet's orbital radius ($a_p$) is defined by the center of mass: $M_s a_s = m_p a_p$. The semi-major axis of the planet's relative orbit is $a = a_s + a_p$.\n    *   Since the planet is much less massive than the star ($m_p \\ll M_s$), we can approximate the planet's semi-major axis as $a \\approx a_p$. From the barycenter equation, we get $a_s = a \\frac{m_p}{M_s + m_p} \\approx a \\frac{m_p}{M_s}$.\n    *   Substituting this into the equation for $v_s$: $v_s \\approx \\frac{2\\pi}{T} \\left(a \\frac{m_p}{M_s}\\right)$.\n    *   Next, we use Kepler's Third Law to relate the semi-major axis $a$ to the period $T$: $T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M_s + m_p)} a^3$.\n    *   Again, using the approximation $m_p \\ll M_s$, this simplifies to $T^2 \\approx \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M_s} a^3$.\n    *   We can rearrange this to express $a$ in terms of $T$: $a \\propto (M_s T^2)^{1/3}$.\n    *   Now substitute this relationship for $a$ back into the expression for $v_s$:\n        $v_s \\propto \\frac{1}{T} \\cdot \\frac{m_p}{M_s} \\cdot (M_s T^2)^{1/3}$\n        $v_s \\propto \\frac{m_p}{M_s^{2/3}} T^{-1/3}$\n    *   Since $K \\propto v_s$ and we are given that $M_s$ and $m_p$ are the same for both systems, the only variable part of the relationship is the period $T$. This gives us the crucial proportionality:\n        $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Period Ratio:**\n    *   From the proportionality $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$, we can write a ratio equation for the two systems:\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{T_1^{-1/3}}{T_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   To find the desired ratio $T_2/T_1$, we cube both sides of the equation:\n        $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n    *   Substituting the known ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes:\n        $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n6.  **Perform the final computation:**\n\n```python\n# Calculate the cube of the ratio 5/7\nratio_of_periods = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio_of_periods)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.36443148688046646\n</execute_code>\nThe result is approximately 0.364.

    "Here is a summary of the solution:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) of a star is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift of its spectral lines ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$). Therefore, the ratio of the K-amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n    $K_1 / K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2 = 5 / 7$.\n\n2.  **Relate K-amplitude to Orbital Period:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the K-amplitude is given by the formula:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{(M_s + m_p)^{2/3}}$\n    where T is the orbital period, $m_p$ is the planet mass, $M_s$ is the star mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio:** Since the star masses ($M_s$) and planet masses ($m_p$) are identical for both systems, and assuming the same orbital inclination ($i$), these terms cancel out when we take the ratio of $K_1$ to $K_2$:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(T_1)^{-1/3}}{(T_2)^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n4.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the orbital periods, $T_2 / T_1$. We can rearrange the equation above and cube both sides:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Value:** Substituting the ratio of the K-amplitudes (which is the ratio of the wavelength shifts):\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 \\approx 0.364$\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.36, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
