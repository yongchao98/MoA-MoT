    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   The parent is an acetophenone, which is a benzene ring with an acetyl group (-COCH₃). Let's assign this group to position 1.\n*   It has a bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   It has a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   This gives a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nThe order in which these groups are added is critical, as existing substituents direct where new ones will go.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating and an *ortho,para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\nThe final product has all substituents in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution). The presence of the *ortho,para*-directing bromo group at a meta position (position 3 is meta to position 1; position 5 is meta to position 3) is a key feature. This \"unnatural\" position for an *o,p*-director suggests that a simple, direct electrophilic substitution sequence might not work or will give low yields. A more complex strategy, possibly involving the modification or removal of a directing group, is likely required for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option. All options involve steps like reduction of a nitro group (`Fe/HCl`) and deamination (`NaNO₂/HCl` followed by `H₃PO₂`). This confirms that a nitro group is used as a temporary directing group and is then removed.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; v) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; vi) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; vii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`\n    *   Steps i-iv: Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene. This sequence simply returns to the starting material.\n    *   Steps v-vii starting from benzene: Benzene → Bromobenzene → 4-Bromoacetophenone (major product) → 4-Bromo-3-nitroacetophenone. The directing effects of -Br (at C4) and -COCH₃ (at C1) reinforce to direct nitration to position 3. The product is 1-(4-bromo-3-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which is the wrong isomer. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`\n    *   i-ii: Benzene → Aniline.\n    *   iii: `CH₃COCl/AlCl₃` on aniline. Friedel-Crafts acylation fails on anilines because the amino group complexes with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), strongly deactivating the ring. The reaction that occurs is N-acylation to form acetanilide.\n    *   Assuming acetanilide is formed: iv) Bromination gives p-bromoacetanilide. v) Nitration gives 4-bromo-2-nitroacetanilide. vi-vii) This sequence involves diazotization and deamination. This would first require hydrolysis of the amide to an amine (4-bromo-2-nitroaniline), then deamination to yield 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene. This is not the final product, and there are no further steps. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) ...`\n    *   i: Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n    *   ii: Nitration gives a mixture of o- and p-nitrobromobenzene. The major product is 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene.\n    *   iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by both a nitro group and a halogen. This reaction fails or gives a very poor yield. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`\n    Let's trace this sequence carefully. This option appears to use a directing group that is later removed.\n    *   **i) Benzene + `CH₃COCl/AlCl₃` → Acetophenone.** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n    *   **ii) Acetophenone + `Br₂/FeBr₃` → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The acetyl group is a meta-director, so bromination occurs at position 3.\n    *   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + `HNO₃/H₂SO₄` → Nitration.** This is a crucial step. The ring has a meta-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an ortho,para-director (-Br at C3).\n        *   -COCH₃ directs nitration to C5.\n        *   -Br directs nitration to C2, C4, C6.\n        *   This competition usually leads to a mixture. However, to construct a high-yield synthesis for the 1,3,5-product, a specific strategy must be employed. Let's assume the synthesis plan is to introduce a temporary nitro group at a position where it (as an amino group) can direct the final nitro group correctly, and then be removed. The most activated positions for nitration are o/p to the bromo group, so let's assume the nitro group is introduced at C4 or C6. Let's take C4.\n        *   Intermediate product: **3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone**.\n    *   **iv) Product from (iii) + `Fe/HCl` → 3-bromo-4-aminoacetophenone.** The nitro group introduced in step (iii) is reduced to an amino group.\n    *   **v) Product from (iv) + `HNO₃/H₂SO₄` → Nitration.** This is the step where the final nitro group is added. In the strong acid, the amino group is protonated to -NH₃⁺, which is a strong deactivator and *meta*-director. We are nitrating 3-bromo-4-ammonioacetophenone.\n        *   -COCH₃ (at C1) is a *m*-director → directs to C5.\n        *   -Br (at C3) is an *o,p*-director → directs to C5 (since C1, C2, C4 are part of the molecule or its substituents, and C6 is an alternate o-position) - Correction: Br at C3 directs to C2,C4,C6. C4 is occupied. so directs to C2,C6.\n        *   -NH₃⁺ (at C4) is a *m*-director → directs to C2, C6.\n        My previous analyses were a bit messy. Let's reassess this step's directing effects again:\n        Substituents: -COCH₃ (1, meta), -Br (3, ortho,para), -NH₃⁺ (4, meta).\n        *   -COCH₃ directs to 5.\n        *   -Br (at 3) directs to 2 and 6.\n        *   -NH₃⁺ (at 4) directs to 2 and 6.\n        The directors strongly favor positions 2 and 6 over 5. This pathway does not seem to work as analyzed.\n\nLet's reconsider the entire strategy. There must be a flaw in the common interpretation. A known, albeit advanced, method for 1,3,5 substitution involving an o,p director uses an initial acylation, followed by nitration, which can be controlled.\nLet's re-examine the sequence:\n**Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.**\n1. Benzene + `CH₃COCl/AlCl₃` → Acetophenone.\n2. Acetophenone + `HNO₃/H₂SO₄` → 3-Nitroacetophenone.\n3. 3-Nitroacetophenone + `Br₂/FeBr₃` → 1-acetyl-3-bromo-5-nitrobenzene. Both the -COCH₃ and -NO₂ groups are *meta*-directors. They are meta to each other. Therefore, they both direct the incoming bromine to position 5. This is a highly selective reaction. Although the ring is deactivated, halogenation is still possible under these conditions and gives the desired product cleanly.\n\nThis direct 3-step synthesis is chemically sound and gives a high yield of the correct isomer.\n1. `CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`\n2. `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`\n3. `Br₂/FeBr₃`\n\nNow, let's look at the options again. None of the options present this exact simple sequence. They are all much more complex. This often happens in difficult multiple-choice questions where the intended answer follows a less obvious, but valid path, or where the most direct path is omitted as an option.\n\nGiven the choices, we must find the best possible fit, even if it has questionable steps. We have ruled out A, B, and D on fairly solid grounds (wrong isomer, impossible reaction). Option C remains. The first two steps of C are plausible (Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone). The failure of C in our analysis came from step (iii) and the subsequent convoluted deamination pathway that led to the wrong product.\n\nThere is a high probability that the question or options are flawed. However, if forced to choose the \"best\" option, chemists often look for the sequence that establishes the main carbon skeleton and the correct relative stereochemistry early on. Option C begins with acylation then meta-bromination `(i -> ii)`. This sets up the 1,3-relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups. The crucial step is the introduction of the nitro group at position 5. If we assume that the complex reaction sequence C is a convoluted but correct way to achieve this transformation, it stands as the most plausible choice compared to others that are more clearly incorrect. The logic would be that the deamination sequence is necessary to overcome the unfavorable directing effects in the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. Although our paper analysis of that deamination route failed, it might involve subtleties we have missed, making it the intended \"high-yield\" path.\n\nLet's retry the analysis of C, but assuming the temporary nitro group in step (iii) is placed at C2.\niii) 3-Bromoacetophenone -> **2-nitro-3-bromoacetophenone**. (Ortho to acetyl, ortho to bromo - very hindered, but let's see).\niv) -> 2-amino-3-bromoacetophenone.\nv) Nitration of this (amine becomes NH3+). Ring: -COCH3(1,m), -NH3+(2,m), -Br(3,o,p).\n   - COCH3 directs to 5.\n   - NH3+ directs to 4, 6.\n   - Br directs to 5 (para to Br is 6... wait, para to Br at 3 is 6. Oh dear). Let's be precise: Br at 3 directs to 2,4,6. Position 2 occupied. Directs to 4,6.\n   This is getting hopelessly confusing and no path seems to work.\n\nLet's return to the most plausible direct synthesis: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination. This pathway is sound. The provided options are complex, and rigorous analysis shows them to be flawed. In such cases, one must suspect an error in the question or options. However, let's reconsider option C's first three steps: `Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration`. While we argued nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone would be non-selective, it is the only sequence starting point that could potentially form the 1,3,5 product backbone from the start. It's possible that this route is considered viable, and the rest of the steps in option C are an error. Given the clear failures of A, B, and D, C remains the most likely intended answer, despite its apparent flaws.\n\nLet's assume the purpose of the deamination steps in C is to make the formation of the 1,3,5 product possible. This implies my analysis of the path failed. Let's try one last time.\nMaybe the temporary nitro group is added at C5?\niii) 3-bromoacetophenone -> **3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone**. This is the product. No more steps needed. So C is wrong.\n\nLet's go back to basics. Is there any way to interpret the option C sequence that works?\nThe only remaining possibility is a significant error in my understanding of one of the reactions. Without finding such an error, C appears to be the 'least incorrect' answer by elimination and by having the most plausible start to forming the C-Br and C-C bonds in the correct meta-relationship.\n\nFinal check. Let's re-evaluate all options on the probability of being the intended answer.\nA -> wrong isomer. definite fail.\nB -> FC acylation on aniline. definite fail.\nD -> FC acylation on dinitroring. definite fail.\nC -> complex path. our analysis shows fail, but relies on predicting products of tricky substitutions. This has the highest chance of being 'correct' if our analysis has a subtle error.\n\nTherefore, despite the difficulties, C is the most probable answer in a multiple choice setting.\n\n<<<C>>>"
