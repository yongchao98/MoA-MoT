    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH2(COOCH3)2`. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-hydrogen between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `Na+ [CH(COOCH3)2]−`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-CH3C6H4-CH=CH-COOCH3`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The carbon-carbon double bond is activated by the electron-withdrawing ester group, making the β-carbon electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The malonate enolate `[CH(COOCH3)2]−` attacks the β-carbon of the methyl acrylate derivative.\n    *   This conjugate addition (1,4-addition) results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond and a new enolate intermediate.\n    *   This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) or during workup to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Predict the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the malonate, `CH(COOCH3)2`, attaches to the β-carbon of the acrylate, which is the carbon bearing the p-tolyl group.\n    *   The α-carbon of the acrylate gains a proton.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `(CH3OOC)2CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH2-COOCH3`.\n\n4.  **Name the Product A and Compare with Options:**\n    *   The product is an ester of a tricarboxylic acid. The IUPAC name can be derived by identifying the longest carbon chain with the principal functional groups. The structure is `CH3OOC-CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-CH(COOCH3)2`. This corresponds to trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate if we consider the main chain to be C(1)H(COOMe)2 - C(2)H(p-tolyl) - C(3)H2-COOMe.\n    *   Let's analyze the options for A:\n        *   `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`: This name corresponds to the structure `CH3OOC-CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-CH(COOCH3)2`, which is the correct product.\n        *   `trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate`: This corresponds to the structure `p-CH3C6H4-CH2-CH(COOCH3)-CH(COOCH3)2`, which would result from a different, non-Michael addition pathway.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type and Reactants:**\n    *   This is a **Stork enamine reaction**, a variation of the Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are nucleophilic at the α-carbon.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH3-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a carbanion on the acceptor, which is then protonated.\n    *   The final step is the hydrolysis of the iminium ion with aqueous acid (H3O+) to regenerate the ketone.\n\n3.  **Predict the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is regenerated.\n    *   A new substituent is added at the α-position (C2) of the cyclohexanone.\n    *   The substituent is derived from but-2-enenitrile after the addition and protonation: `-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n    *   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone: `2-(-CH(CH3)CH2CN)cyclohexan-1-one`.\n\n4.  **Name the Product B and Compare with Options:**\n    *   Naming the product as a butanenitrile derivative, the main chain is `N≡C(1)-C(2)H2-C(3)H-C(4)H3`. The substituent at C3 is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group. So the name is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`.\n    *   Let's analyze the options for B:\n        *   `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`: This is the keto form, which is the major, stable product after acidic hydrolysis. This matches our prediction.\n        *   `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`: This is the enol form of the product. While the keto and enol forms are in equilibrium, the keto form is generally more stable and considered the major final product of a Stork enamine reaction after workup.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type and Known Components:**\n    *   This is a Michael addition reaction, but we need to identify one of the starting materials (C) by looking at the product (a retrosynthetic approach).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH2=CH-C(=O)CH3`.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Catalyst:** KOH is a base that will generate the nucleophile from reactant C.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Product Structure:**\n    *   The product has two parts: a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring and a `(3-oxobutyl)` side chain, which is `-CH2-CH2-C(=O)CH3`.\n    *   In a Michael addition, the new C-C bond forms between the Michael donor and the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor.\n    *   The `-CH2-CH2-C(=O)CH3` fragment comes from the acceptor, MVK (`CH2=CH-C(=O)CH3`), after the addition and protonation. The bond is formed at the terminal `CH2` group (the β-carbon).\n\n3.  **Identify Reactant C:**\n    *   Since the side chain comes from the acceptor (MVK), the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring must be the Michael donor (C).\n    *   The C-2 position of cyclohexane-1,3-dione is a highly acidic active methylene group (`-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-`).\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates this C-2 position to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, which then acts as the nucleophile in the Michael addition.\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The required reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n    *   The alternative, `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione`, is not a standard starting material and is structurally unstable. Cyclohexane-1,3-dione itself exists predominantly as its enol tautomer (`3-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one`), but is referred to by its diketone name.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the results for the three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of reactants and products matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
