    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Experimental Observations:**\n    *   **Compound:** A small synthetic peptide. Peptides are made of amino acids linked by amide bonds. Most natural amino acids are chiral.\n    *   **¹H NMR Data:**\n        *   Two distinct peaks are observed for a single proton (an alpha-proton).\n        *   The combined integral of these two peaks is 1H, which is the expected value for a single proton.\n        *   The integrals of the two separate peaks are \"roughly equal,\" implying the two species they represent are present in a ~1:1 ratio.\n        *   This phenomenon is not due to spin-spin coupling.\n        *   **Interpretation:** The presence of two peaks for what should be a single proton indicates that the proton exists in two different chemical environments. This means the compound is not a single, pure substance but rather a mixture of (at least) two very similar molecules.\n\n    *   **LC-MS Data:**\n        *   Two clearly defined peaks are seen in the liquid chromatogram (LC).\n        *   These two peaks have equal intensities, confirming the ~1:1 ratio seen in the NMR.\n        *   Crucially, both peaks show the *same mass spectrum*, and this mass is \"consistent with the expected molecule.\"\n        *   **Interpretation:** The LC data confirms there are two distinct chemical species that can be physically separated due to differences in their properties (like polarity). The mass spectrometry (MS) data proves that these two species have the same molecular formula and molecular weight; therefore, they are isomers of the target molecule.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Possible Explanations (Options A-D):**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis would almost certainly have a different chemical formula and therefore a different molecular weight. The MS data, which shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the final product, rules this option out.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** In a standard NMR solvent (which is achiral), enantiomers are indistinguishable and would produce a single set of peaks, not two separate peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **LC:** On a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers co-elute and produce a single peak.\n        *   Since the observations include two NMR peaks and two LC peaks using standard techniques, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereoisomers are expected to have different NMR spectra. It is very common for corresponding protons in a pair of diastereomers to have different chemical shifts, leading to separate peaks. This perfectly matches the NMR data.\n        *   **LC:** Because they have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, shape), diastereoisomers can be separated by standard LC techniques. This perfectly matches the observation of two peaks in the chromatogram.\n        *   **MS:** Diastereoisomers have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data.\n        *   **Source in Peptides:** Diastereomers can arise in peptide synthesis either from racemization of a chiral center (epimerization) or, very commonly, from restricted rotation around an amide bond (*cis/trans* isomers, which are a form of diastereomer). The latter is especially prevalent with proline residues and often results in nearly equal populations of the two isomers, matching the observation of \"roughly equal integrals.\" This option is fully consistent with all the data.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** A \"double coupling\" event would mean an extra amino acid was added, or a linker was attached twice. In any such scenario, the resulting molecule would have a different chemical formula and a significantly higher molecular weight than the intended product. The MS data, which shows the mass is consistent with the expected molecule, rules this option out.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only explanation that reconciles all the experimental data—two distinct species observed in both NMR and LC, having the same mass but different physical properties—is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
