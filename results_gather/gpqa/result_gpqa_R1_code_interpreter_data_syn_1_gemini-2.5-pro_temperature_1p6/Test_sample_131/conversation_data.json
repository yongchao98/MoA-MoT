    "This problem requires us to deduce the components of a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds from its 1H NMR spectrum. We will analyze the predicted NMR spectrum for each possible compound and then see which pair in a 1:1 mixture matches the given spectral data.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Experimental NMR Data**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectra of the Candidate Compounds**\n\nWe need to determine the number of unique proton environments (which corresponds to the number of signals) for both aromatic and aliphatic protons in each candidate molecule. All compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will appear as a single signal. Since there are no adjacent protons, this signal will be a **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. This will give a single signal for all 12 methyl protons: **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. They will appear as a **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent but different from the C1/C4 pair. This results in two distinct signals: **two singlets (6H each)**, giving a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. H4 is between two methyl groups, while H6 is not. This results in **two singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** This molecule has four distinct methyl groups. However, due to very similar environments, two of them are often accidentally equivalent (have the same chemical shift). A typical spectrum shows **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule's spectrum is characteristic of an ethyl group.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The CH2 protons would appear as a quartet, and the CH3 protons would appear as a triplet. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, so this compound can be **eliminated**. This also eliminates option **D**.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Mixture Spectra for the Remaining Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture. The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24H. The aliphatic signal ratio is 2:1:1. This corresponds to signals integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H (since (2+1+1) = 4 parts, and 24H/4 = 6H per part).\n\nLet's check which pair produces this pattern.\n\n*   **Mixture A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: {one 12H singlet} from 1,2,4,5-TMB and {three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H} from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This combination does not yield the required {12H, 6H, 6H} pattern. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Mixture B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: {two 6H singlets} from 1,2,3,4-TMB and {three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H} from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This combination cannot produce a 12H signal. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Mixture C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB provides two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aromatic region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, these two singlets will have equal intensity, giving a **1:1 ratio**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that matches all the described 1H NMR data.\n\nTo formally verify this, a script can be used to outline the properties of each potential mixture.\n```python\ndef analyze_options():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the 1H NMR predictions for each option based on the properties of the individual compounds.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Predicted individual spectra\n    spectra = {\n        \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": [2], \"aliphatic_Me\": [12]},\n        \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": [1, 1], \"aliphatic_Me\": [6, 3, 3]},\n        \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": [2], \"aliphatic_Me\": [6, 6]},\n        \"1,4-diethylbenzene\": {\"notes\": \"Has non-singlet aliphatic signals (quartet, triplet).\"}\n    }\n    \n    # Options to test\n    options = {\n        \"A\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"B\": (\"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"C\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"D\": (\"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,4-diethylbenzene\")\n    }\n    \n    print(\"Analyzing NMR data for each option:\\n\")\n    \n    for opt, pair in options.items():\n        c1, c2 = pair\n        \n        # Rule out option D immediately\n        if \"diethylbenzene\" in c1 or \"diethylbenzene\" in c2:\n            print(f\"Option {opt}: {pair}\")\n            print(\"  Result: Mismatch. 1,4-diethylbenzene would produce triplets and quartets, not singlets in the aliphatic region.\\n\")\n            continue\n            \n        # Combine signals for the mixture\n        c1_spec = spectra[c1]\n        c2_spec = spectra[c2]\n        \n        # Aromatic region analysis\n        # We need two signals in a 1:1 ratio.

    "### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem and Analyze the Given NMR Data:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds in the mixture have the formula C10H14. This formula has a degree of unsaturation of 4, consistent with a substituted benzene ring. The remaining C4H14 are the substituents.\n    *   **Mixture:** The compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the mixture is 1:1, this implies that each compound produces a different aromatic signal, and these signals must have equal numbers of protons. The total number of aromatic protons in each molecule is 2 (from 6 positions on the benzene ring minus 4 methyl groups). Therefore, each compound must produce a single aromatic signal integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. The total number of aliphatic protons is 12 for each molecule (4 methyl groups x 3 protons/methyl), so the total in the mixture is 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24H corresponds to signals integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H respectively (since 24H / (2+1+1) = 6H per unit of the ratio).\n\n2.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound:**\n    We need to check the number of signals (chemical non-equivalence) and their splitting patterns for each of the four potential compounds.\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   This molecule is highly symmetrical (D2h symmetry).\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will appear as a single signal. Since they have no adjacent protons, this is a **singlet (2H)**.\n        *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. This gives rise to a single signal for all 12 methyl protons: **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They will appear as a **singlet (2H)**.\n        *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent, but they are in a different environment from the C1/C4 pair. This results in two distinct signals: **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   This molecule has lower symmetry.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 is adjacent to two methyl groups, while the proton at C6 is adjacent to one. They are chemically non-equivalent and will appear as **two separate singlets (1H each)**.\n        *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C3 are equivalent (6H), C2 is unique (3H), and C5 is unique (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H:3H:3H ratio)**.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   The molecular formula C10H14 is correct. However, it has ethyl groups, not methyl groups. The CH2 protons would be split by the CH3 protons into a quartet, and the CH3 protons would be split into a triplet. The problem states that all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets. Therefore, **this compound can be immediately ruled out**. This eliminates option D.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Remaining Options as 1:1 Mixtures:**\n\n    *   **Requirement for Aromatic Region:** Two 2H singlets. This means the mixture must be composed of two compounds that *each* give one 2H aromatic singlet. Based on our analysis above, only **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** fit this criterion. This strongly suggests the answer is **C**.\n\n    *   **Verify with Aliphatic Region for Option C:**\n        *   **Mixture:** 1:1 mix of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n        *   **Contribution from 1,2,4,5-TMB:** One 12H singlet.\n        *   **Contribution from 1,2,3,4-TMB:** Two 6H singlets.\n        *   **Total Aliphatic Spectrum:** The combined spectrum will show three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n        *   **Ratio:** The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** perfectly matches the described NMR data.\n    *   **Aromatic:** It provides two 2H singlets (one from each compound), giving a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** It provides three singlets with integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H, corresponding to a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nThis analysis was confirmed by the Python script, which systematically checked each option and found that only option C matched both the aromatic and aliphatic spectral data.\n\n<<<C>>>"
