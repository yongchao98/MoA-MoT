    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxy acid like mCPBA is a **syn-addition** of an oxygen atom across the double bond to form an epoxide. For (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene), this stereospecific reaction produces a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the mCPBA can attack from either the top face or the bottom face with equal probability. This results in the formation of a **racemic mixture** of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening with H₃O⁺.** The acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an epoxide is a stereospecific reaction that proceeds via an **anti-addition** mechanism. The nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond, causing an inversion of configuration at the center it attacks.\n\nThe overall two-step process (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene.\n\nThere's a well-established stereochemical rule for anti-additions to symmetrical alkenes:\n*   **(E)-alkene + Anti-addition → Meso compound**\n\nLet's apply this rule: (E)-oct-4-ene undergoes anti-dihydroxylation to yield a single, achiral **meso** product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This compound has two stereocenters of opposite configuration and is achiral due to internal symmetry (specifically, a center of inversion).\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol.**\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The syn-addition of oxygen to (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) produces a cis-epoxide. A cis-epoxide formed from a symmetrical alkene like (Z)-oct-4-ene has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a **meso** compound: meso-4,5-epoxyoctane. Only one epoxide product is formed.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening with H₃O⁺.** This step is again an **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n\nLet's apply the stereochemical rule for anti-additions to symmetrical alkenes:\n*   **(Z)-alkene + Anti-addition → Racemic mixture**\n\nApplying this rule: (Z)-oct-4-ene undergoes anti-dihydroxylation to yield a **racemic mixture** of two enantiomers: (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 2: A 1:1 mixture of (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.**\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1) - Achiral\n2.  **(4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2) - Chiral\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2) - Chiral\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   (2) and (3) are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   (1) is a **diastereomer** of both (2) and (3).\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and thus will have different retention times and separate into different peaks.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. They will co-elute and appear as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the achiral HPLC will show one peak for the meso-diol and a second peak for the unresolved racemic pair of enantiomers.\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   It will separate the enantiomers (4R,4R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol into two distinct peaks.\n    *   It will also separate the meso-diol from the two chiral enantiomers, as it is their diastereomer.\n    *   Therefore, all three unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>"
