    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the goal:** The objective is to calculate the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Recall the relevant physical principles:**\n    *   **Mean Decay Distance:** The mean distance a particle travels before decaying is given by $L = v \\cdot \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's speed and $\\tau$ is its mean lifetime in the frame of reference where the distance is measured (the lab frame).\n    *   **Relativistic Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a moving particle ($\\tau$) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame ($\\tau_0$, also called proper lifetime). The relationship is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Lorentz Factor:** The Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{mc^2}$, where E is the total energy of the particle and m is its rest mass. In particle physics, we often use units where the speed of light c = 1, so $\\gamma = E/m$.\n    *   **Lifetime and Decay Width:** The proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ of an unstable particle is related to its decay width $\\Gamma$ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula is $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n3.  **Combine the formulas:**\n    *   Start with the mean decay distance formula: $L = v \\cdot \\tau$.\n    *   Substitute the time-dilated lifetime: $L = v \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0)$.\n    *   The velocity can be written as $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = v/c$. So, $L = \\beta c \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    *   Substitute the expression for proper lifetime: $L = \\beta c \\gamma \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}\\right)$.\n    *   Rearrange the terms to group constants: $L = (\\beta \\gamma) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$. This is the master formula we will use.\n\n4.  **Extract the given values and constants:**\n    *   Total energy of X: $E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   Mass of X: $m_X = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   Decay width of X: $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   A useful physical constant is $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$, which is $197.327 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{m}$.\n\n5.  **Perform the calculations step-by-step:**\n    *   **Calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:**\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X} = \\frac{8 \\, \\text{GeV}}{1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}} = \\frac{80}{12} = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.667$\n    *   **Calculate the term $\\beta \\gamma$:**\n        There is a useful relativistic identity: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. Also, momentum is $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m (\\beta c)$.\n        From this, we get $pc = (\\beta \\gamma) mc^2$.\n        So, $(\\beta\\gamma)mc^2 = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$.\n        Dividing by $mc^2$ gives $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{E}{mc^2}\\right)^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n        Now plug in the value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{20}{3}\\right)^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{400}{9} - \\frac{9}{9}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{391}{9}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3} \\approx 6.59124$\n    *   **Ensure consistent units:**\n        $\\Gamma_X$ is in MeV, and our constant $\\hbar c$ is in MeVÂ·m. So, everything is consistent. No unit conversion is needed for $\\Gamma_X$.\n    *   **Calculate the mean decay distance L:**\n        $L = (\\beta \\gamma) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3}\\right) \\frac{197.327 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{m}}{320 \\, \\text{MeV}}$\n        $L \\approx (6.59124) \\times \\frac{197.327}{320} \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n        $L \\approx 6.59124 \\times 0.616647 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n        $L \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n\n6.  **Final check with a Python script:** To ensure accuracy, the calculation can be performed using a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\n# hbar * c in MeV*m.

In units where c=1 (as is common in particle physics), this is:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m}$\n    *   The speed of the particle in the lab frame is $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = v/c$.\n    *   The mean decay distance $L$ is the distance the particle travels on average before decaying, given by:\n        $L = v \\tau = (\\beta c) (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau_0$\n    *   Substituting the expression for $\\tau_0$:\n        $L = \\beta \\gamma c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} = (\\beta \\gamma) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n    *   There is a useful relativistic identity relating $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$: $\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$. This comes from $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, where $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m (\\beta c)$.\n        Therefore, the final formula is:\n        $L = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n3.  **Numerical Calculation**:\n    *   **Given values**:\n        *   Total energy $E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n        *   Rest mass $m_X = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$ (note: mass is often given in units of energy like GeV or MeV, implying $mc^2$)\n        *   Decay width $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   **Physical constant**:\n        *   $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm} = 197.327 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{m}$\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$**.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X} = \\frac{8 \\, \\text{GeV}}{1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}} = \\frac{80}{12} = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.667$\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate $\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$**.\n        $\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{20}{3}\\right)^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{400}{9} - \\frac{9}{9}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{391}{9}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3} \\approx 6.591$\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the mean decay distance $L$**.\n        $L = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3}\\right) \\frac{197.327 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{m}}{320 \\, \\text{MeV}}$\n        $L \\approx (6.5912) \\times \\frac{197.327}{320} \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n        $L \\approx 6.5912 \\times 0.6166 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n        $L \\approx 4.064 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n\n4.  **Comparison with Code Output and Options**:\n    *   The Python script, which uses more precise values for the constants, calculated the result as $4.064467... \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\n    *   Let's compare this with the given options:\n        A) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n        B) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n        C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n        D) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n    *   The calculated value $4.064 \\times 10^{-15}$ m is extremely close to option A, $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m. The small difference (about 0.02%) is likely due to the precision of the physical constants ($\\hbar c$) used to generate the question's options. Given the choices, A is the clear answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
