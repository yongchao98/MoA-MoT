    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the total number of protons.**\n    The integration values for the signals are 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H. The sum of these integrations is 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons. This tells us the total number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule is 8.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the molecular formula of the possible compounds.**\n    *   **Propenyl acetate** (CH3COOCH=CHCH3): The molecular formula is C5H8O2. The number of hydrogen atoms is 3 (from the acetate methyl) + 1 (vinylic H) + 1 (vinylic H) + 3 (from the propenyl methyl) = 8 hydrogens. This matches the NMR data.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate** (e.g., CH3COOCH=CHCH2CH3 for but-1-enyl acetate): The molecular formula is C6H10O2. The number of hydrogen atoms is 10. This does not match the NMR data.\n    *   Therefore, we can eliminate the butenyl acetate options (B and C). The compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Assign the signals to the protons in the propenyl acetate structure.**\n    The structure is CH3(a)-COO-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH3(d).\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet with 3H integration around 2 ppm is characteristic of an acetate methyl group (CH3(a)). It has no adjacent protons, so it's a singlet. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet with 3H integration is a methyl group split by a single proton. This corresponds to the propenyl methyl group (CH3(d)), which is split by the adjacent vinylic proton H(c).\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** A signal for one proton that is a doublet of quartets (dq) means this proton is coupled to one proton on an adjacent carbon and three protons on another adjacent carbon. This perfectly describes the vinylic proton H(c), which is coupled to H(b) (causing the doublet splitting) and the methyl group CH3(d) (causing the quartet splitting).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d):** A signal for one proton that is a doublet means it's coupled to only one adjacent proton. This corresponds to the vinylic proton H(b), which is coupled to H(c). Its chemical shift is the highest because it is on the same carbon as the electron-withdrawing oxygen atom (-O-). The coupling constant is J = 16.0 Hz.\n\n*   **Step 4: Use the coupling constant to determine the stereochemistry (Cis or Trans).**\n    The key piece of information is the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons, H(b) and H(c). The problem states this is J = 16.0 Hz.\n    *   For vinylic protons, a **trans** arrangement (protons on opposite sides of the double bond) results in a large coupling constant, typically **J_trans = 12-18 Hz**.\n    *   A **cis** arrangement (protons on the same side of the double bond) results in a smaller coupling constant, typically **J_cis = 6-12 Hz**.\n    The observed coupling constant of 16.0 Hz is clearly in the range for a trans configuration.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The NMR data corresponds to a propenyl acetate structure where the two vinylic hydrogens are in a trans orientation. Therefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
