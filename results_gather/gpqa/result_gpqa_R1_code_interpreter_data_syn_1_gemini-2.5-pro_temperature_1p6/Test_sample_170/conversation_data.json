    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a substituted benzene ring. The substituent already on the ring dictates two things:\n*   **Reactivity (Rate):** Activating groups increase the rate of reaction, while deactivating groups decrease it.\n*   **Orientation (Position of attack):** Substituents direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to specific positions.\n    *   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They are typically activating groups (like alkyl groups -CH3, -C2H5) or halogens (-Cl).\n    *   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions meta to themselves. They are typically deactivating groups with a double or triple bond to a more electronegative atom (like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR).\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nLet's classify each substituent from the list:\n\n*   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an alkyl group. It is **activating** and **ortho, para-directing**. It will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n*   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is an ester group. It is **deactivating** and **meta-directing**. It will produce a very small amount of the para-isomer.\n*   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a halogen. It is **deactivating** (due to induction) but **ortho, para-directing** (due to resonance). It will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n*   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a nitro group. It is strongly **deactivating** and **meta-directing**. It will produce an extremely small amount of the para-isomer.\n*   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an alkyl group. It is **activating** and **ortho, para-directing**. It will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n*   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a carboxylic acid group. It is **deactivating** and **meta-directing**. It will produce a very small amount of the para-isomer.\n\n**3. Initial Grouping**\n\nBased on the directing effects, we can separate the substances into two groups:\n*   **Low para-isomer yield (meta-directors):** {2, 4, 6}\n*   **High para-isomer yield (ortho, para-directors):** {1, 3, 5}\n\nThe final arranged list will have the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\nOrder: {2, 4, 6} < {1, 3, 5}\n\n**4. Ordering the Meta-Directors {2, 4, 6}**\n\nFor meta-directors, the amount of the minor para-product formed is inversely proportional to the group's deactivating strength. The stronger the deactivator, the more selectively it directs to the meta position, and the lower the yield of ortho and para isomers.\n\nLet's rank the deactivating strength of these groups: -NO2, -COOH, -COOC2H5.\n*   The nitro group (-NO2) is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing and deactivating groups.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a strong deactivator.\n*   The ester group (-COOC2H5) is also a deactivator, but the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (-C2H5) makes it slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\nSo, the order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield will be the reverse:\n**4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5)**\n\n**5. Ordering the Ortho, Para-Directors {1, 3, 5}**\n\nFor ortho, para-directors, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho products. This ratio is governed by electronic and steric factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric hindrance around the ortho positions makes the para position relatively more accessible for the incoming bromine. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para product than toluene.\n    *   Yield: **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5)**\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chlorine atom is a special case. Although it deactivates the ring, it directs ortho, para. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is felt most strongly at the nearby ortho positions, making them electronically less favorable for attack compared to the para position. This electronic effect, combined with sterics, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (~89%) is typically higher than for alkylbenzenes like toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Yield: **5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\nCombining these, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\n**1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n**6. Final Assembly**\n\nNow we combine the orders of the two groups:\n\n{4 < 6 < 2} < {1 < 5 < 3}\n\nThe final complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
