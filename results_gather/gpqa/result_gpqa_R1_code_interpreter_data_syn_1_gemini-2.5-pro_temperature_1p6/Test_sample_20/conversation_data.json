    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound that **does not** show tautomerism from the pair: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a type of isomerism where two structural isomers, called tautomers, are in dynamic equilibrium with each other. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must possess an alpha-hydrogen. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to an alpha-carbon, which is the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This alpha-carbon must be `sp³` hybridized.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring containing three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are `sp³` hybridized and are each bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Structure diagram:**\n        ```\n           O=C(1)\n          /  \\\n        H₂C(6) C(2)H₂\n        |     |\n      O=C(5)  C(3)=O\n          \\  /\n           C(4)H₂\n        ```\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups. For example, C-2 is alpha to both C-1 and C-3 carbonyls. Since these alpha-carbons are `sp³` hybridized and have hydrogen atoms attached, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione possesses alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism to form its enol tautomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and very stable compound. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does show tautomerism**.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone:**\n    *   **Structure:** The common form is 1,4-benzoquinone. It's a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O double bonds at opposite positions.\n    *   **Structure diagram:**\n        ```\n             O\n             ||\n            C\n           / \\\n        HC = CH\n        |    |\n        HC = CH\n           \\ /\n            C\n            ||\n            O\n        ```\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons alpha to the carbonyl groups are C-2, C-3, C-5, and C-6. All of these carbons are `sp²` hybridized as they are part of the ring's C=C double bonds. There are no `sp³` hybridized alpha-carbons, and thus no alpha-hydrogens in the sense required for standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone **does not show tautomerism**.\n\n**Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound will show optical isomerism from the pair: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in a molecule is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid).\n        ```\n             OH\n             |\n        CH₃ - C* - C(=O)-O-CH₃\n             |\n             H\n        ```\n    *   **Chirality:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C-2, marked with an asterisk). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since C-2 is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will show optical isomerism** (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl Fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid.\n        ```\n           H      COOCH₃\n            \\    /\n             C==C\n            /    \\\n        H₃COOC     H\n        ```\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar around the C=C double bond. It possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C bond. Any molecule with a center of symmetry is achiral. It does not have any chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule, it is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it **will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Result for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching these findings with the given options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
