    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} * \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}} * (1-A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n- $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n- $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n- $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n- $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n**3. Form the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nWe can write the expression for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for the two planets:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} * \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}} * (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} * \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}} * (1-A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. It also states that they have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis means the problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2/a_1$.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\nThe problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) caused by each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's maximum radial velocity ($K$, also called the RV semi-amplitude) by:\n$K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}a}} \\sqrt{G}$\nHere, $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, $a$ is the semi-major axis, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\nSince the planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits must be viewed nearly edge-on, so we can assume the inclination $i \\approx 90^{\\circ}$, which means $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_{star} a}}$\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$\\sqrt{a} = \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{K \\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\implies a = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{K^2 M_{star}}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-major Axes**\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 G / (K_2^2 M_{star})}{M_{p1}^2 G / (K_1^2 M_{star})}$\n\nThe terms $G$ and $M_{star}$ cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2}{K_2^2} \\frac{K_1^2}{M_{p1}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**6. Substitute Known Ratios**\nWe can find the ratios for planet masses and K-values from the given information.\n\n- **Mass ratio:**\n$M_{p1} = 7 M_{earth}$\n$M_{p2} = 5 M_{earth}$\n$\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n- **K-value ratio (from Doppler shifts):**\n$K_1 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n$K_2 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow substitute these ratios into the equation for $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\nFinally, we substitute the ratio of the semi-major axes back into our temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given ratios\nM_p_ratio = 5 / 7  # M_p2 / M_p1\ndelta_lambda_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04 # delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# The RV semi-amplitude ratio is equal to the doppler shift ratio\nK_ratio = delta_lambda_ratio # K1 / K2\n\n# The ratio of semi-major axes a2/a1 is (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\n# We could also directly calculate the temperature ratio, which simplifies to:\n# T_eq_ratio = sqrt(a2/a1) = (M_p2/M_p1) * (K1/K2)\n# Let's verify both paths give the same result\n\n# Path 1: Calculate a_ratio first\na_ratio_2_over_1 = (M_p_ratio)**2 * (K_ratio)**2\nT_eq_ratio_1_over_2 = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_over_1)\nprint(f\"Result from Path 1: {T_eq_ratio_1_over_2}\")\n\n# Path 2: Simplified formula\nT_eq_ratio_simplified = M_p_ratio * K_ratio\nprint(f\"Result from Simplified Path: {T_eq_ratio_simplified}\")\n\n# Calculate 15/28 for comparison\nprint(f\"Direct calculation of 15/28: {15/28}\")\n```\n>>>\nResult from Path 1: 0.5357142857142857\nResult from Simplified Path: 0.5357142857142857\nDirect calculation of 15/28: 0.5357142857142857\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536.

Since $c$ and $\\lambda_0$ are constants for both measurements, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}a}} \\sqrt{G}$\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet mass, $M_{star}$ is the star mass, $a$ is the semi-major axis, $i$ is the inclination of the orbit, and $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince the planets are detected via the transit method, their orbital inclination $i$ must be close to $90^{\\circ}$, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula becomes:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_{star} a}}$\n\nNow, we solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$\\sqrt{a} = \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{K \\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\implies a = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{K^2 M_{star}}$\n\n**5.
