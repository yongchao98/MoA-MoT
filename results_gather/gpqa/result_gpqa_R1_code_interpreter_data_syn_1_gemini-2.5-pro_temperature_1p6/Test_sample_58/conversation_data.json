    "This problem requires us to determine the pH of a solution formed by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The pH will be determined by the substance that is in excess after all neutralization reactions have occurred.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of acidic and basic species:**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol CH3COOH\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles = 0.400 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol HCl\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 mol of H+.\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles = 0.300 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)2\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that releases two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 -> Ba²+ + 2OH⁻), the moles of OH⁻ are:\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 * 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol OH⁻\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions:**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react completely with the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) first, before reacting with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid + Strong Base**\n    *   H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    *   The strong acid (H⁺) is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Weak Acid + Remaining Strong Base**\n    *   CH3COOH + OH⁻ → CH3COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n    *   The weak acid (CH3COOH) is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of excess OH⁻ remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**3. Determine the final composition and calculate the pH:**\n\nAfter all reactions, the final solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH⁻). The presence of the strong base will be the primary determinant of the solution's pH.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of the excess OH⁻ ions:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = (Moles of excess OH⁻) / (Total Volume)\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH of the solution:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH of the solution:**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nTo confirm the calculation precisely:\n```python\nimport math\n\nmoles_oh_excess = 0.050\ntotal_volume = 1.2\nfinal_oh_conc = moles_oh_excess / total_volume\npOH = -math.log10(final_oh_conc)\npH = 14 - pOH\nprint(pH)\n```\nExecution of the code yields:\n```\n12.619788758280321\n```\nThe calculated pH is approximately 12.62.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 8.68\nB) 1.38\nC) 8.92\nD) 12.62\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
