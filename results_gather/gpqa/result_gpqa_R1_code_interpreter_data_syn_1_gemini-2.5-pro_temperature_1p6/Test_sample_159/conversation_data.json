    "The problem describes the Fraunhofer diffraction from an aperture. The first step is to determine the shape of the aperture.\n\n1.  **Aperture Shape:** An N-sided regular polygon where N is infinitely large (N → ∞) and the apothem 'a' is constant becomes a circle. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which becomes the radius of the limiting circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a **circular aperture of radius 'a'**.\n\n2.  **Diffraction by a Circular Aperture:** When monochromatic light of wavelength λ passes through a circular aperture, it creates a diffraction pattern known as the Airy pattern. The intensity distribution in the far field is given by:\n    $I(\\theta) = I_0 \\left[ \\frac{2 J_1(k a \\sin\\theta)}{k a \\sin\\theta} \\right]^2$\n    where:\n    *   $I_0$ is the central maximum intensity.\n    *   $J_1(x)$ is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n    *   $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$ is the wave number.\n    *   'a' is the radius of the aperture.\n    *   $\\theta$ is the angular distance from the central axis.\n\n3.  **Position of Minima:** The intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator is zero, which corresponds to the zeros of the Bessel function $J_1(x)$. The condition for the m-th minimum is:\n    $k a \\sin\\theta_m = z_{1,m}$\n    where $z_{1,m}$ is the m-th non-zero root of the Bessel function $J_1(x)$.\n\n4.  **Small Angle Approximation:** The problem states that we can use the small angle approximation, so $\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta$. The condition for the m-th minimum becomes:\n    $k a \\theta_m = z_{1,m}$\n    Substituting $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$:\n    $\\frac{2\\pi a}{\\lambda} \\theta_m = z_{1,m}$\n    Solving for the angular position $\\theta_m$:\n    $\\theta_m = \\frac{z_{1,m} \\lambda}{2\\pi a}$\n\n5.  **Angular Distance Calculation:** We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima (m=1 and m=2).\n    *   Angular position of the first minimum (m=1): $\\theta_1 = \\frac{z_{1,1} \\lambda}{2\\pi a}$\n    *   Angular position of the second minimum (m=2): $\\theta_2 = \\frac{z_{1,2} \\lambda}{2\\pi a}$\n\n    The angular distance between them is:\n    $\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_2 - \\theta_1 = \\frac{z_{1,2} \\lambda}{2\\pi a} - \\frac{z_{1,1} \\lambda}{2\\pi a} = \\left( \\frac{z_{1,2} - z_{1,1}}{2\\pi} \\right) \\frac{\\lambda}{a}$\n\n6.  **Numerical Values:** To get the final answer, we need the numerical values of the first two non-zero roots of $J_1(x)$:\n    *   $z_{1,1} \\approx 3.8317$\n    *   $z_{1,2} \\approx 7.0156$\n\n    The calculation was performed using the Python code interpreter in the thinking process:\n    ```\n    Code output: 0.5067\n    ```\n    This output represents the coefficient $\\left( \\frac{z_{1,2} - z_{1,1}}{2\\pi} \\right)$.\n    Let's verify the calculation:\n    Coefficient = $\\frac{7.0156 - 3.8317}{2 \\times 3.14159...} = \\frac{3.1839}{6.2832} \\approx 0.50676$\n\n    So, the angular distance is:\n    $\\Delta\\theta \\approx 0.50676 \\frac{\\lambda}{a}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Comparing this result to the given options, the value $0.50676$ is closest to $0.506$.\n\n    A) 0.500 $\\lambda / a$\n    B) 0.610 $\\lambda / a$ (This corresponds to the position of the first minimum, $\\theta_1 = \\frac{z_{1,1}}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\lambda}{a} \\approx 0.610 \\frac{\\lambda}{a}$)\n    C) 1.220 $\\lambda /a$\n    D) 0.506 $\\lambda / a$\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
