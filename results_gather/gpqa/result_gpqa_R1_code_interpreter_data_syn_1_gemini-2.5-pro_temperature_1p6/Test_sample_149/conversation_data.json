    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the given NMR data.**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 DBE (one ring and three double bonds). This leaves one additional degree of unsaturation, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) or a C=N bond.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR spectrum:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO), typically found between 9-10 ppm. The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3 peaks). This suggests a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic sign of a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of an amino group (-NH2). The broadening is due to quadropolar relaxation and exchange with trace amounts of water.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) multiplicity means it's coupled to a single adjacent proton (1+1=2 peaks). This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment, as this CH2 group is coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n\n3.  **Assemble the structure:**\n    We have the following fragments: a para-disubstituted benzene ring, a -CH2-CHO group, and an -NH2 group. Placing these substituents at the para positions (1 and 4) of the benzene ring gives us the structure: **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's check if the molecular formula matches: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (side chain) + NH2 = C8H9NO. This is correct. The structure is consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n\n*   **Reagents 1 and 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O.**\n    This is a two-step process:\n    1.  **Diazotization:** The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl) at low temperatures to form a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** Gently warming the diazonium salt solution with water replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n    This sequence effectively converts the amino group on the benzene ring to a hydroxyl group. The aldehyde group remains unchanged.\n    The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat.**\n    This reagent provides a basic medium and heat, which are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, possesses both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde). Therefore, it can undergo a self-condensation reaction.\n\n    **Mechanism of Aldol Condensation:**\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate nucleophile.\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Subsequent protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n        The structure of this addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option A).\n    3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **heat** promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group from the β-carbon (C3) and an acidic proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed to form a double bond. This dehydration is highly favorable because it creates an extended conjugated system (the new C=C double bond is conjugated with the C=O of the aldehyde).\n        The final condensation product has a double bond between C2 and C3.\n        Its structure is `(HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH=C(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)`.\n        The IUPAC name for this structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product among the options.**\n\n*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol *addition* product, formed before dehydration. Since the reaction is heated, this is an intermediate, not the final product.\n*   B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: This is incorrect because the starting material has hydroxyphenyl groups, not phenyl groups.\n*   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: The molecular structure is inconsistent with a self-condensation product.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed after the dehydration step of the aldol condensation. The \"Heat\" condition strongly indicates that this dehydration occurs to give the thermodynamically stable conjugated product. This matches our derived final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
