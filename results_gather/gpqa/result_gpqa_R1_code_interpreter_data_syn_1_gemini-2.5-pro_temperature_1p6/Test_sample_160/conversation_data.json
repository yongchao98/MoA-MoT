    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ₁ and λ₂.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions**\n    *   **λ₁**: This is the mean free path (MFP) of gas molecules colliding *with each other*. The chamber contains a low-density gas, and these molecules are moving due to thermal energy, colliding with one another.\n    *   **λ₂**: This is the mean free path of the beam electrons colliding *with the gas molecules*. High-energy electrons are fired through the same gas, and we're interested in how far they travel, on average, before scattering off a gas molecule.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Mean Free Path**\n    The general formula for the mean free path (λ) of a particle traveling through a collection of target particles is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` = the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` = the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that a target presents to the incoming particle for a collision to occur.\n\n3.  **Analyze λ₁ (Gas-Gas Collisions)**\n    *   For gas molecules colliding with each other, the particles are all moving with similar thermal speeds. The kinetic theory of gases provides a more specific formula that accounts for the relative motion of all particles. This introduces a factor of the square root of 2.\n    *   The formula is: λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    *   Here, `n` is the number density of gas molecules, and `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section between two gas molecules.\n    *   The collision cross-section `σ_gg` for two identical spherical molecules of diameter `d` is approximately `πd²`. This is because a collision occurs if the center of the projectile molecule comes within a distance `d` of the center of the target molecule. The \"target area\" is therefore a circle of radius `d`.\n\n4.  **Analyze λ₂ (Electron-Gas Collisions)**\n    *   The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, making them highly relativistic (moving at over 90% the speed of light). Their velocity is orders of magnitude greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. Therefore, we can treat the gas molecules as stationary targets.\n    *   When the targets are stationary, the √2 factor is not needed. The formula simplifies to the basic form: λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    *   Here, `n` is the same number density of gas molecules, and `σ_eg` is the collision cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n    *   To determine `σ_eg`, we consider a point-like electron projectile hitting a spherical gas molecule of diameter `d` (and radius `r = d/2`). A simple geometric collision occurs if the electron hits the molecule. The target area is the cross-sectional area of the molecule itself, which is `πr²` or `π(d/2)²`.\n    *   So, using a simple geometric \"hard-sphere\" model: `σ_eg ≈ π(d/2)² = (1/4)πd²`.\n\n5.  **Compare λ₁ and λ₂**\n    Now we can set up a ratio of the two mean free paths:\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\n    Now, substitute our approximations for the cross-sections:\n    *   σ_gg ≈ πd²\n    *   σ_eg ≈ π(d/2)² = (1/4)πd²\n\n    λ₂ / λ₁ ≈ √2 * ( πd² / [ (1/4)πd² ] )\n    λ₂ / λ₁ ≈ √2 * 4\n    λ₂ / λ₁ ≈ 5.66\n\n    This calculation shows that λ₂ is approximately 5.66 times larger than λ₁.\n\n6.  **Conclusion from Analysis**\n    The analysis reveals two key reasons why the electron's mean free path (λ₂) is much longer than the gas molecule's mean free path (λ₁):\n    *   **Collision Cross-Section:** The effective target area for a large gas molecule colliding with another is significantly larger (by a factor of ~4) than the target area for a tiny, point-like electron colliding with a gas molecule. A smaller cross-section leads to a longer mean free path.\n    *   **Target Motion:** The formula for gas-gas collisions includes a √2 factor in the denominator to account for the motion of all particles, which effectively increases the collision frequency and shortens the MFP. This factor is absent for the ultra-fast electrons hitting \"stationary\" gas targets.\n\n    Both effects lead to the conclusion that λ₂ is significantly larger than λ₁. Our estimate is λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Given Options**\n    *   A) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁\n    *   B) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation\n    *   C) λ₂ < λ₁\n    *   D) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁\n\n    Our result (λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁) is fully consistent with option A. It definitively rules out B, C, and D. The value 1.22 is simply a lower bound, and our physics-based estimate comfortably exceeds it.\n\n<<<A>>>"
