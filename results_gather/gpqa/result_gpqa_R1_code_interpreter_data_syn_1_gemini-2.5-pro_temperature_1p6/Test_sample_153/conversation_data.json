    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound containing the most abundant isotope of each element.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion. Its relative intensity is 32% compared to the M⁺ peak (100%). This M⁺ to M⁺+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32 ≈ 3:1) is the classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\nLet's check the molecular weights of the given options. All options, being isomers, have the same molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   MW (C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂) = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + 35 + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n*   MW (C₇H₅³⁷ClO₂) = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + 37 + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158 g/mol.\nAll four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data. We must use the other spectra to distinguish between them.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration, specifically that of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options **B) Phenyl chloroformate** (which is an acid chloride/ester, lacking the -OH group) and **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (which has a phenolic -OH and an aldehyde C=O, not a carboxylic acid). We are left with options A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid and C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region (7-8.5 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals in this region:\n    *   8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H)\n    *   7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)\n*   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly indicative of a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern on a benzene ring. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring means there are only two unique types of aromatic protons, and they split each other into doublets.\n*   **Let's analyze the remaining options:**\n    *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho* (1,2) substituted ring. It has no symmetry plane that simplifies the proton signals. All four aromatic protons would be in unique chemical environments, leading to a much more complex spectrum with four different signals (likely multiplets), not two simple doublets for 2H each.\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para* (1,4) substituted ring. It has the required symmetry. The two protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are equivalent and appear as one signal. The two protons adjacent (ortho) to the chlorine atom are also equivalent and appear as a second signal. This structure perfectly matches the observed NMR data of two doublets, each representing 2H.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBy synthesizing all the data, we can confidently identify the compound. The MS confirms a molecular weight of 156 with one chlorine atom. The IR and ¹H NMR confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The specific pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum points unequivocally to a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. Only **4-chlorobenzoic acid** fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<C>>>"
