    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle:** The problem asks for the speed of light as measured by an observer in a laboratory, when the light is traveling through a medium (glass) that is itself moving relative to the observer. This is a classic problem in special relativity. The simple Galilean addition of velocities (e.g., speed_lab = speed_in_glass + speed_of_glass) is incorrect for speeds approaching the speed of light. We must use the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\n2.  **Define the Frames of Reference:** It's crucial to correctly define the different inertial frames of reference.\n    *   **Frame S (The Laboratory Frame):** This is the observer's frame. It's considered the \"stationary\" frame. The velocity of the glass in this frame is `v`. The velocity of the light beam we want to find is `u`.\n    *   **Frame S' (The Glass's Frame):** This is the frame of reference moving along with the glass. In this frame, the glass is at rest. The velocity of the light beam in this frame is `u'`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Known Velocities:**\n    *   `v`: The velocity of frame S' (the glass) relative to frame S (the lab). This is given as `v`.\n    *   `c`: The speed of light in a vacuum. The problem states to take `c = 1`.\n    *   `u'`: The velocity of the light beam relative to frame S' (the glass). In the frame where the glass is at rest, the speed of light is determined by the index of refraction, `n`. The definition of the index of refraction is `n = c / (speed in medium)`. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass is `u' = c / n`. Since we are given `c = 1`, we have `u' = 1/n`. The problem states the light beam and the glass are moving in the *same direction*, so we'll use a positive sign for `u'`.\n\n4.  **Select the Correct Formula:** The relativistic velocity addition formula relates these velocities. To find the velocity `u` in the lab frame S, given the velocity `u'` in the moving frame S' and the frame velocity `v`, the formula is:\n    \n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n5.  **Substitute and Solve:** Now, I'll plug the values from Step 3 into the formula from Step 4.\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these into the formula:\n    \n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:** The next step is to simplify this algebraic expression.\n    \n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n    \n    To clear the fractions within the main fraction, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    \n    `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    \n    Distribute the `n` in both the numerator and denominator:\n    \n    `u = ( n * (1/n) + n * v ) / ( n * 1 + n * (v/n) )`\n    \n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** Finally, I'll compare my result with the given choices:\n    *   A) 1\n    *   B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    *   C) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    *   D) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    \n    My calculated result, `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`, perfectly matches option C.\n\n8.  **Sanity Check (Optional but Recommended):**\n    *   What if the glass isn't moving (`v = 0`)? The formula gives `u = (1 + n*0) / (n + 0) = 1/n`. This is the correct speed of light in stationary glass.\n    *   What if the medium is a vacuum (`n = 1`)? The formula gives `u = (1 + 1*v) / (1 + v) = (1+v)/(1+v) = 1`. This is also correct. The speed of light in a vacuum is always `c=1`, regardless of the motion of the source or observer.\n    \n    The checks confirm the formula is behaving as expected.\n\nThis detailed, step-by-step process, based on the principles of special relativity, leads directly to the correct answer. No numerical computation with Python is necessary since this is a symbolic problem.\n\n<<<C>>>"
