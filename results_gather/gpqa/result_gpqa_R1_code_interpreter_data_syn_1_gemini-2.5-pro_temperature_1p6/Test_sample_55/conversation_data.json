    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Transition Process\nThe problem describes a two-step decay process for a hydrogen atom, starting from the excited state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ and ending in the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The transitions are electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$. The process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nThe question asks for the specific path (i.e., the intermediate state) and the probability of that specific path occurring. This \"probability\" is interpreted as the branching fraction for the specified cascade.\n\n### 2. Applying Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nThe selection rules for an E1 transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n*   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n = n' - n$ can be any integer, but for decay (spontaneous emission), energy must be released, so $n' < n$.\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State (First Transition)\n*   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a $3s$ state, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n*   Applying the selection rules for the first transition to $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$:\n    *   $\\Delta n < 0 \\implies n_i < 3$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_i - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l_i$ must be a non-negative integer, we must have $l_i=1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_i - 0 = m_i = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   This means the intermediate state must be a $p$-state ($l_i=1$) with $n_i=2$ (since the $1p$ state does not exist).\n*   So, the possible intermediate states belong to the $2p$ subshell: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All options presented in the question correctly identify an intermediate state from this set.\n\n### 4. Verifying the Second Transition\n*   **Intermediate State:** $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ (a $2p$ state).\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (a $1s$ state, $n'=1, l'=0, m'=0$).\n*   Applying selection rules for the second transition:\n    *   $\\Delta n = 1 - 2 = -1$ (Allowed).\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed).\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m_i = -m_i$. Since $m_i$ can be $-1, 0, 1$, $\\Delta m$ can be $1, 0, -1$, which are all allowed values.\n*   Therefore, a transition from any of the $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ states to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state is allowed. All the paths listed in the options are valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe total probability of a specific cascade is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n$P_{\\text{cascade}} = \\text{BR}(\\text{step 1}) \\times \\text{BR}(\\text{step 2})$\n\n**Step 1 Branching Ratio: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_i\\rangle$**\n*   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle 2,1,m_i|\\mathbf{r}|3,0,0\\rangle|^2$.\n*   According to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, for a transition from a spherically symmetric initial state (like an $s$-state where $l=0$), the transition probabilities to the different magnetic substates ($m_i$) of the final degenerate level are equal.\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric. The final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields).\n*   Therefore, the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ populates these three intermediate states with equal probability.\n*   Since there are three possible states, the branching ratio for decaying into any *one* of them is $1/3$.\n*   For the route through $|2,1,0\\rangle$, we have $\\text{BR}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$.\n\nWe can confirm this by calculating the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which determine the angular part of the transition probability. The calculation below shows the relative rates are equal.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import S\nfrom sympy.physics.wigner import clebsch_gordan\n\n# The probability of a specific cascade is the product of branching ratios.\n# Total P = BR(step1) * BR(step2)\n\n# --- Step 1: |3,0,0> -> |2,1,m_i> ---\n# This is a 3s -> 2p transition.\n# The initial state is |l=0, m=0>.

The $n=1$ shell only contains the $1s$ state.\n*   Therefore, the *only* possible E1 decay path from any $2p$ state is to the $1s$ ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   Since this is the only channel, its branching ratio is 1.\n    $\\text{BR}(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n**Total Probability**\nThe probability of the specific cascade $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is:\n$P = (1/3) \\times 1 = 1/3$.\n\n### 6. Conclusion\nLet's check the options:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ - Incorrect probability.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - The probability for this path would also be $1/3$, so this option is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ - This matches our calculation for both the path and the probability.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - The probability for this path would also be $1/3$, so this option is incorrect.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Process and Governing Rules\nThe problem describes a two-step radiative decay of a hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via an intermediate state. The transitions are specified as \"dipole transitions,\" which implies they are governed by the electric dipole (E1) selection rules. The goal is to find the specific intermediate state and the probability (branching ratio) of that particular decay path.\n\nThe decay process can be written as:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nThe E1 selection rules are:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{\\text{final}} - l_{\\text{initial}} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{\\text{final}} - m_{\\text{initial}} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n = n_{\\text{final}} - n_{\\text{initial}}$ can be any integer, but for decay (spontaneous emission), energy must decrease, so $n_{\\text{final}} < n_{\\text{initial}}$.\n\n### 2. Determine the Intermediate State\nWe apply the selection rules to the first transition (Step 1):\n*   **Initial state:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Intermediate state:** $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$.\n\nApplying the rules:\n*   $\\Delta n < 0$: $n_i$ must be less than 3. The options suggest $n_i = 2$, which is a valid transition to a lower energy state.\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l_i = 1$.\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: Since the initial state has $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m_i = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\nTherefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All paths presented in the options use a valid intermediate state.\n\n### 3. Verify the Second Transition\nNow we check if the second transition from the intermediate state to the final state is allowed:\n*   **Intermediate state:** $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ (where $m_i$ could be -1, 0, or 1).\n*   **Final state:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nApplying the rules:\n*   $\\Delta n = 1 - 2 = -1$ (Allowed).\n*   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed).\n*   $\\Delta m = 0 - m_i$. This is allowed if $m_i$ is -1, 0, or 1, which it is.\n\nSo, all proposed cascade routes are physically possible according to the selection rules.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe probability of a specific cascade is the product of the branching ratios of each individual step.\n$P_{\\text{cascade}} = \\text{Branching Ratio (Step 1)} \\times \\text{Branching Ratio (Step 2)}$\n\n**Branching Ratio for Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_i\\rangle$**\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state, which is spherically symmetric.\n*   It decays into a set of three degenerate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n*   Due to the symmetry of the initial state, the transition probability is equal for each of the final magnetic substates ($m_i = -1, 0, 1$).\n*   Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability (or branching ratio) for decaying into any single one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   Therefore, the branching ratio for the transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This was confirmed by the python code calculation based on Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\n**Branching Ratio for Step 2: $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   An atom in the state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ (a $2p$ state) must decay to a lower energy level. The only available lower energy shell is $n=1$.\n*   The $n=1$ shell only contains the $1s$ state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   The transition to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed by the selection rules.\n*   Since this is the *only* possible E1 decay channel from the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state, it must occur with a probability of 1.\n*   Therefore, the branching ratio for the transition $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is $1$.\n\n**Total Probability for the Cascade in Option C**\nThe total probability for the cascade $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is:\n$P = (\\text{BR for Step 1}) \\times (\\text{BR for Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThis matches option C. For completeness, the probability for the cascades in options B and D would also be $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$, but the options list incorrect probability values for them.\n\n<<<C>>>"
