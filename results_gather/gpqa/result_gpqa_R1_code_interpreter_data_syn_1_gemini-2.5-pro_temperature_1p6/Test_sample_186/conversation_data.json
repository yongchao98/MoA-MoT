    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Instrument:** ESPRESSO spectrograph on a single 8m Very Large Telescope (VLT).\n    *   **Detection Threshold:** A signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel.\n    *   **Exposure Time:** 1 hour (3600 seconds).\n    *   **Goal:** Determine how many of the six listed stars are detectable under these conditions.\n\n2.  **Determine the Limiting Magnitude:**\n    The first step is to find the faintest apparent V magnitude (V_lim) that ESPRESSO can observe to achieve an S/N of 10 in one hour. This information can be found using the ESPRESSO Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) or its performance documentation.\n\n    *   According to the performance plots in the ESPRESSO User Manual (Figure 10), for a 900-second exposure in 1-UT High-Resolution (HR) mode, a star with V=16 gives an S/N of about 8 per pixel.\n    *   The signal-to-noise ratio scales with the square root of the exposure time (t), so S/N ∝ √t.\n    *   We are using a 1-hour (3600s) exposure, which is four times longer than the 900s in the plot. The S/N will be higher by a factor of √4 = 2.\n    *   Therefore, for a 3600s exposure, a V=16 star would yield an S/N of 8 * 2 = 16.\n    *   We need to find the magnitude (V_lim) that gives S/N = 10. We can use the relationship between magnitude (m) and S/N: `m2 - m1 = -2.5 * log10(Flux2 / Flux1)` and since S/N is proportional to √Flux, `Flux ∝ S/N²`. This leads to `m2 - m1 = -5 * log10(S/N2 / S/N1)`.\n    *   Using our reference point (m1=16, S/N1=16) and the target S/N (S/N2=10):\n        `V_lim - 16 = -5 * log10(10 / 16)`\n        `V_lim - 16 = -5 * (-0.204)`\n        `V_lim - 16 = 1.02`\n        `V_lim ≈ 17.02`\n    *   So, a star is detectable if its apparent V magnitude is approximately 17.0 or brighter (i.e., V ≤ 17.0).\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Star:**\n    Now, we evaluate each star based on two criteria:\n    *   Is it visible from the Paranal Observatory (Latitude ≈ -24.6° S)?\n    *   Is its apparent V magnitude ≤ 17.0?\n\n    **a) Canopus:**\n    *   **Magnitude:** Apparent V magnitude ≈ -0.74.\n    *   **Observability:** Declination is -52° 41′. This is well within the observable range from Paranal.\n    *   **Verdict:** Its magnitude of -0.74 is much brighter than 17.0. **Detectable.**\n\n    **b) Polaris:**\n    *   **Magnitude:** Apparent V magnitude ≈ 1.98.\n    *   **Observability:** Declination is +89° 15′. This is the North Star and is not visible from the Southern Hemisphere's latitude of -24.6°. It never rises above the horizon.\n    *   **Verdict:** Not observable. **Not Detectable.**\n\n    **c) Star with M_V = 15, d = 10 pc:**\n    *   **Magnitude:** We calculate the apparent magnitude (m_V) using the distance modulus formula: `m_V - M_V = 5 * log10(d/10)`.\n        `m_V - 15 = 5 * log10(10/10) = 0`, so `m_V = 15.0`.\n    *   **Observability:** Declination is 0°, on the celestial equator, which is perfectly observable from Paranal.\n    *   **Verdict:** Its magnitude of 15.0 is brighter than 17.0. **Detectable.**\n\n    **d) Star with M_V = 15, d = 200 pc:**\n    *   **Magnitude:** `m_V - 15 = 5 * log10(200/10) = 5 * log10(20) ≈ 5 * 1.301 = 6.505`. So `m_V ≈ 21.5`.\n    *   **Observability:** Declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n    *   **Verdict:** Its magnitude of 21.5 is fainter than 17.0. **Not Detectable.**\n\n    **e) Star with M_V = 15, d = 5 pc:**\n    *   **Magnitude:** `m_V - 15 = 5 * log10(5/10) = 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 5 * (-0.301) = -1.505`. So `m_V ≈ 13.5`.\n    *   **Observability:** Declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n    *   **Verdict:** Its magnitude of 13.5 is brighter than 17.0. **Detectable.**\n\n    **f) Star with M_V = 15, d = 50 pc:**\n    *   **Magnitude:** `m_V - 15 = 5 * log10(50/10) = 5 * log10(5) ≈ 5 * 0.699 = 3.495`. So `m_V ≈ 18.5`.\n    *   **Observability:** Declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n    *   **Verdict:** Its magnitude of 18.5 is fainter than 17.0. **Not Detectable.**\n\n4.  **Final Count:**\n    The detectable stars are: Canopus, Star (c), and Star (e).\n    The total count is 3.\n\nTo verify and formalize this process, the following Python code executes the calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_apparent_magnitude(M_V, d_pc):\n    \"\"\"Calculates apparent V magnitude from absolute V magnitude and distance.\"\"\"\n    if d_pc <= 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    return M_V + 5 * math.log10(d_pc / 10.0)\n\ndef is_observable(dec_deg, lat_deg=-24.6, min_altitude_deg=20):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a star can be observed at a reasonable altitude from a given latitude.\n    A star is considered observable if its maximum altitude at culmination is >= min_altitude_deg.\n    \"\"\"\n    max_altitude = 90 - abs(lat_deg - dec_deg)\n    return max_altitude >= min_altitude_deg\n\n# Limiting V magnitude for ESPRESSO to achieve S/N=10 in 1 hour.\n# Based on ESPRESSO User Manual performance plots.\nV_lim = 17.02\n\n# List of stars to analyze\nstars = [\n    {'name': 'a) Canopus', 'm_V': -0.74, 'M_V': None, 'd_pc': None, 'dec_deg': -52.7},\n    {'name': 'b) Polaris', 'm_V': 1.98, 'M_V': None, 'd_pc': None, 'dec_deg': 89.26},\n    {'name': 'c) Star d=10pc', 'm_V': None, 'M_V': 15, 'd_pc': 10, 'dec_deg': 0},\n    {'name': 'd) Star d=200pc', 'm_V': None, 'M_V': 15, 'd_pc': 200, 'dec_deg': 0},\n    {'name': 'e) Star d=5pc', 'm_V': None, 'M_V': 15, 'd_pc': 5, 'dec_deg': 0},\n    {'name': 'f) Star d=50pc', 'm_V': None, 'M_V': 15, 'd_pc': 50, 'dec_deg': 0}\n]\n\ndetectable_count = 0\nprint(\"--- ESPRESSO Detectability Analysis ---\")\nprint(f\"Limiting apparent V magnitude for S/N=10 in 1hr: {V_lim:.2f}\\n\")\n\nfor star in stars:\n    # Calculate apparent magnitude if not given\n    if star['m_V'] is None:\n        star['m_V'] = calculate_apparent_magnitude(star['M_V'], star['d_pc'])\n\n    # Check observability\n    observable = is_observable(star['dec_deg'])\n    \n    # Check if magnitude is within the limit\n    bright_enough = star['m_V'] <= V_lim\n    \n    # A star is detectable if it's both observable and bright enough\n    is_detectable = observable and bright_enough\n    \n    if is_detectable:\n        detectable_count += 1\n        \n    print(f\"{star['name']}:\")\n    print(f\"  Apparent V mag = {star['m_V']:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"  Observable? -> {observable}\")\n    print(f\"  Bright enough?

    "To determine how many of the listed stars would be detectable, we need to check two conditions for each star:\n1.  **Observability:** The star must be visible from the Paranal Observatory in Chile (Latitude ≈ -24.6° S). Stars in the far northern celestial hemisphere, like Polaris, are not visible from the southern hemisphere.\n2.  **Brightness:** The star's apparent V magnitude (m_V) must be bright enough to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 in a 1-hour exposure.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Limiting Magnitude**\n\nFirst, we establish the faintest apparent V magnitude ESPRESSO can detect under the specified conditions. According to the ESPRESSO performance documentation for the 1-UT (one 8m telescope) High-Resolution mode, an exposure of 900 seconds (15 minutes) on a V=16 magnitude star yields an S/N of about 8.\n\nThe S/N ratio scales with the square root of the exposure time and inversely with the flux (which relates to magnitude). We are using a 1-hour (3600 seconds) exposure, which is 4 times longer than 900 seconds.\n\n*   Increase in S/N from longer exposure: √ (3600s / 900s) = √4 = 2.\n*   So, for a V=16 star, a 1-hour exposure gives an S/N of 8 * 2 = 16.\n\nWe need to find the magnitude (V_lim) that gives an S/N of 10. We can use the formula relating magnitude and S/N: `m2 - m1 = -5 * log10(S/N2 / S/N1)`.\n*   `V_lim - 16 = -5 * log10(10 / 16)`\n*   `V_lim - 16 = -5 * log10(0.625) ≈ -5 * (-0.204) = 1.02`\n*   `V_lim ≈ 16 + 1.02 = 17.02`\n\nTherefore, a star is considered detectable if it is observable from Paranal and its apparent V magnitude is approximately **17.0 or brighter (i.e., m_V ≤ 17.0)**.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Each Star**\n\n*   **a) Canopus:**\n    *   Observability: Its declination is -52°, which is easily visible from Paranal's southern latitude.\n    *   Brightness: Its apparent V magnitude is -0.74, which is much brighter than 17.0.\n    *   **Verdict: Detectable.**\n\n*   **b) Polaris:**\n    *   Observability: Its declination is +89°. As the North Star, it is not visible from the Paranal Observatory in the southern hemisphere.\n    *   **Verdict: Not Detectable.**\n\n*   **c) Star with M_V = 15, d = 10 pc:**\n    *   Observability: Declination is 0° (on the celestial equator), which is observable from Paranal.\n    *   Brightness: We calculate the apparent magnitude (m_V) using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d / 10)`\n        `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10 / 10) = 15 + 0 = 15.0`. This is brighter than 17.0.\n    *   **Verdict: Detectable.**\n\n*   **d) Star with M_V = 15, d = 200 pc:**\n    *   Observability: Declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n    *   Brightness: `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 6.51 = 21.51`. This is fainter than 17.0.\n    *   **Verdict: Not Detectable.**\n\n*   **e) Star with M_V = 15, d = 5 pc:**\n    *   Observability: Declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n    *   Brightness: `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 - 1.51 = 13.49`. This is brighter than 17.0.\n    *   **Verdict: Detectable.**\n\n*   **f) Star with M_V = 15, d = 50 pc:**\n    *   Observability: Declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n    *   Brightness: `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 3.49 = 18.49`. This is fainter than 17.0.\n    *   **Verdict: Not Detectable.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThree stars are detectable: Canopus, Star (c), and Star (e).\n\n<<<A>>>"
