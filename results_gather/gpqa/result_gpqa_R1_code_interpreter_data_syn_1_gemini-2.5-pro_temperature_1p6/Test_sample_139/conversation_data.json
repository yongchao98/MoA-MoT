    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the clues to identify Substance X and other unknowns (Y, W, G, B).**\n\n*   **Clue 1: Substance X contains a heavier isotope.** This suggests isotopes like Deuterium (D or ²H), ¹³C, etc. Deuterium is a common choice for labeled reagents.\n*   **Clue 2 & 3: X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of protons and neutrons.**\n    *   Let's analyze potential gases (W):\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   CO: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Yes)\n    *   The violent reaction and the presence of a heavy isotope strongly suggest a deuterated hydride reacting with a protic solvent. The release of D₂ gas is highly plausible.\n*   **Clue 7: Substance X and its very close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.** This points towards common laboratory reagents. A powerful reducing agent like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) fits this description. Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavy isotope would be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. Let's hypothesize that **X = LiAlD₄**.\n*   **Step 2: Test the hypothesis (X = LiAlD₄) against the remaining clues.**\n    *   Let's re-examine the reaction: X + Y → W + G. If X is LiAlD₄, what is Y? A violent reaction occurs with protic solvents like water. Let's test Y = H₂O and Y = D₂O (heavy water).\n        *   If Y = H₂O: LiAlD₄ + 4 H₂O → LiOH + Al(OH)₃ + 4 HD. The gas produced is HD (hydrogen deuteride). HD has 2 protons and 1 neutron. This does not match the condition for W (protons = neutrons).\n        *   If Y = D₂O: LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂. The gas produced is **W = D₂**. D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which matches the clue. Therefore, liquid Y is likely heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   **Clue 4: A precipitate G forms.** In the reaction above, LiOD is soluble in D₂O, but Aluminium Deuteroxide, **G = Al(OD)₃**, is insoluble and would form a precipitate, just like its analog Al(OH)₃. This fits.\n    *   **Clue 5: G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.**\n        *   Heating the precipitate G: 2 Al(OD)₃(s) → Al₂O₃(s) + 3 D₂O(g).\n        *   The substance released is **B = D₂O**.\n        *   The melting point of D₂O (heavy water) is 3.82 °C. To convert to Kelvin: 3.82 + 273.15 = 276.97 K. This is very close to 277 K. This fits perfectly.\n    *   **Clue 6: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.**\n        *   X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent. A keto acid contains a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). LiAlD₄ reduces both.\n        *   Ketone → Alcohol (>CH-OH)\n        *   Carboxylic Acid → Alcohol (-CH₂-OH)\n        *   For any keto acid, the original two oxygen atoms in the carboxyl group (-COOH) are reduced, and the one oxygen in the ketone group (>C=O) is also reduced, but they are retained in the final product as hydroxyl (-OH) groups. For example, reducing pyruvic acid (CH₃-CO-COOH) yields propane-1,2-diol (CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains **2 atoms of oxygen**. This clue is satisfied.\n\n**Step 3: Confirm the identity of X and perform the final calculation.**\n\n*   All clues point to **Substance X = LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride).\n*   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H, as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   Comparing their atomic numbers (or average atomic masses):\n    *   H: Z=1, Mass ≈ 1 u\n    *   Li: Z=3, Mass ≈ 7 u\n    *   Al: Z=13, Mass ≈ 27 u\n*   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen. The **heaviest element** is Aluminium.\n*   The question requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements present in the molecule. We will use the integer mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved (D = ²H and the most common Al is ²⁷Al), which aligns with the integer answer choices.\n    *   Mass of Deuterium (D or ²H) ≈ 2 amu.\n    *   Mass of Aluminium (²⁷Al) ≈ 27 amu.\n*   In one molecule of LiAlD₄, there are:\n    *   4 atoms of Deuterium.\n    *   1 atom of Aluminium.\n*   Calculation:\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium) = 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium) = 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n    *   Cumulative (sum) of these masses = 8 + 27 = 35 amu.\n\n```python\n# The substance X is identified as LiAlD4.\n# The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as Deuterium, D).\n# The heaviest element is Aluminium (Al).\n# The problem asks for the sum of the atomic masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n\n# Mass number of Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen) is 2.\n# Mass number of Aluminium (Al) is 27.\n# The formula is LiAlD4.\n\n# Number of Deuterium atoms in the formula.\nnum_D_atoms = 4\n# Number of Aluminium atoms in the formula.\nnum_Al_atoms = 1\n\n# Mass numbers for calculation.\nmass_D = 2\nmass_Al = 27\n\n# Calculate the total mass of Deuterium atoms.\ntotal_mass_D = num_D_atoms * mass_D\n\n# Calculate the total mass of Aluminium atoms.\ntotal_mass_Al = num_Al_atoms * mass_Al\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass as requested.\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_D + total_mass_Al\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n\nThe calculation yields 35. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",

Let's hypothesize that **X = LiAlD₄**.\n*   **Clue 2 & 3: X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of protons and neutrons.**\n    *   Let's test our hypothesis. X = LiAlD₄. A violent reaction occurs with protic solvents like water. The reaction must produce a gas W with an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   Possible gas W molecules:\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): A molecule contains 2 protons (1 per D atom) and 2 neutrons (1 per D atom). Protons = Neutrons. This is a plausible candidate.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂: A molecule contains 14 protons (7 per N atom) and 14 neutrons (7 per N atom). This is possible, but less likely given the context of a deuterated hydride.\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O: A molecule contains 14 protons (6+8) and 14 neutrons (6+8). Again, less likely from the inferred reactants.\n    *   The release of D₂ is the most chemically sound option. This would happen if LiAlD₄ reacts with a source of deuterium. Let's assume the liquid **Y is heavy water (D₂O)**. The reaction would be:\n        `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`\n    *   This reaction is indeed violent and produces gas **W = D₂**, which satisfies the proton/neutron condition.\n*   **Clue 4: A precipitate G forms.** In the reaction above, `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`, Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) is soluble, but Aluminium deuteroxide (**G = Al(OD)₃**) is the deuterated analog of aluminum hydroxide, which is a known precipitate. This fits perfectly.\n*   **Clue 5: G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.**\n    *   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) causes decomposition: `2 Al(OD)₃(s) → Al₂O₃(s) + 3 D₂O(g)`.\n    *   The substance released is **B = D₂O** (heavy water).\n    *   The melting point of D₂O is 3.82 °C. Let's convert this to Kelvin: `273.15 + 3.82 = 276.97 K`. This value is indeed \"very close to 277 K\". This strongly confirms our identifications.\n*   **Clue 6: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.**\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a powerful reducing agent that will reduce both groups to alcohols.\n    *   Ketone group is reduced to a secondary alcohol (>CH-OH).\n    *   Carboxylic acid group is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂-OH).\n    *   Example: The reduction of pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH, 3 oxygen atoms) with LiAlD₄ yields propane-1,2-diol (CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH), which contains **2 oxygen atoms** in the two hydroxyl groups. This clue is also satisfied.\n\n**Step 2: Conclude the identity of X and perform the final calculation.**\n\n*   Based on the comprehensive analysis of all clues, Substance **X is LiAlD₄**.\n*   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within X.\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   By atomic number and mass, Hydrogen is the lightest element, and Aluminium is the heaviest.\n*   The problem requires summing the masses of *all atoms* of these two elements. We will use the integer mass numbers for the calculation, as is standard for this type of problem and implied by the integer answer choices.\n    *   Mass of the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H) = 2 amu.\n    *   Mass of the most common isotope of Aluminium (²⁷Al) = 27 amu.\n*   In one formula unit of LiAlD₄, we have:\n    *   4 atoms of Deuterium (the lightest element).\n    *   1 atom of Aluminium (the heaviest element).\n*   Calculation:\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (Deuterium) = 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium) = 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n    *   The cumulative (summed) mass is 8 + 27 = 35 amu.\n\nI will use a python script to verify this simple calculation.\n\n```python\n# The substance X has been identified as Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD4).\n# The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n\n# Identify the lightest and heaviest elements based on their atomic mass.\n# H (D): mass number ~2\n# Li: mass number ~7\n# Al: mass number ~27\n# Lightest element: Hydrogen (as Deuterium)\n# Heaviest element: Aluminium\n\n# The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of these two elements in the formula.\n\n# Mass number of Deuterium (D)\nmass_D = 2\n# Mass number of Aluminium (Al)\nmass_Al = 27\n\n# Number of atoms of each element in the formula LiAlD4\nnum_D = 4\nnum_Al = 1\n\n# Calculate the total mass contribution from the lightest element (Deuterium)\ntotal_mass_lightest_element = num_D * mass_D\n\n# Calculate the total mass contribution from the heaviest element (Aluminium)\ntotal_mass_heaviest_element = num_Al * mass_Al\n\n# Calculate the final cumulative mass\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_lightest_element + total_mass_heaviest_element\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```",
