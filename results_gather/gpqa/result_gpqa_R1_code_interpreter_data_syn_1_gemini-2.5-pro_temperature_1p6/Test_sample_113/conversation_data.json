    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for selecting the suitable reagents for each reaction:\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction starts with a ketone (butan-2-one) and adds a cyanide group (-CN) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) across the carbonyl C=O double bond. The product is a cyanohydrin. This is a classic example of nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl compound.\n2.  **Analyze the reagents:**\n    *   **Butan-2-one:** This is the electrophile, with the carbonyl carbon being susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n    *   **NaCN (Sodium Cyanide):** This provides the cyanide ion (⁻CN), which is a strong nucleophile.\n    *   **Reagent A:** The nucleophilic attack of ⁻CN on the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one forms an alkoxide intermediate:\n        CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃ + ⁻CN → CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃\n    *   To form the final product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃), this alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated (i.e., it needs to accept a proton, H⁺).\n3.  **Determine Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons. The options for A are NaHSO₃ and H₃O⁺.\n    *   **NaHSO₃ (Sodium bisulfite):** This is typically used to form bisulfite adducts, a different reaction. It is not the standard proton source for cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   **H₃O⁺ (Hydronium ion):** This represents a general aqueous acid. An acid is required to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. The reaction is often performed by adding a mineral acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) to a mixture of the ketone and NaCN, which protonates the intermediate to yield the cyanohydrin. Therefore, H₃O⁺ is the correct choice for A.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), while the rest of the molecule remains unchanged. This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n2.  **Analyze the reagents:**\n    *   **H₂O (Water):** Water is required for the hydrolysis.\n    *   **Reagent B:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires a catalyst. It can be performed under either strongly acidic or strongly basic conditions.\n3.  **Determine Reagent B:** The options for B are HCl and CH₃COOH.\n    *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic Acid):** This is a weak acid. While it might protonate the nitrile to some extent, it is generally not a strong enough catalyst to drive the hydrolysis reaction to completion efficiently.\n    *   **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid):** This is a strong mineral acid. Strong acids are standard and effective catalysts for nitrile hydrolysis. The reaction proceeds through protonation of the nitrile, nucleophilic attack by water, and subsequent hydrolysis of the intermediate amide to the carboxylic acid. Therefore, HCl is the most suitable reagent for B.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n*   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n\nMatching these findings with the given options:\nA) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH\nB) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl\nC) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl\nD) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH\n\nThe correct combination is found in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
