    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid is typically found between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **A fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a common fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxylic acid group itself:\n        *   Mass of -COOH = (1 × Mass of C) + (2 × Mass of O) + (1 × Mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   The fragment [COOH]⁺ is a very common and diagnostically significant fragment in the mass spectra of carboxylic acids. This provides strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined data, we have deduced that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: A) C₆H₁₂O₂ and C) C₆H₁₀O₂.\n    *   To distinguish between them, we can use the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n        *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n        *   Our molecule has one C=C double bond (1 DoU) and one C=O double bond (1 DoU), for a total of **2 degrees of unsaturation**.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This does not match our required DoU of 2.\n        *   **For C) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This perfectly matches the DoU required for a molecule containing one C=C bond and one C=O bond.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nAll spectroscopic evidence points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that contains two oxygen atoms and has the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both an alkene (C=C) and a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(C, H):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a formula C(x)H(y)O(z).\"\"\"\n    return int(C + 1 - (H / 2))\n\n# Degrees of Unsaturation needed based on spectroscopy:\n# 1 for C=C (alkene) + 1 for C=O (carbonyl) = 2\ndou_required = 2\nprint(f\"Required Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) based on spectra: {dou_required}\\n\")\n\n# Calculate DoU for each option\nprint(\"Calculating DoU for each option:\")\nprint(f\"A) C6H12O2: DoU = {calculate_dou(6, 12)}\")\nprint(f\"B) C6H12O:  DoU = {calculate_dou(6, 12)}\")\nprint(f\"C) C6H10O2: DoU = {calculate_dou(6, 10)}\")\nprint(f\"D) C6H10O:  DoU = {calculate_dou(6, 10)}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nAdditional Checks:\")\n# Check number of oxygen atoms.

    "Based on the interpretation of the spectroscopic data and the results from the executed code, here is the final conclusion:\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A broad peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹ combined with a strong peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹ is definitive evidence of a **carboxylic acid** functional group (-COOH). This group contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   A strong peak at ~1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an **alkene** (a C=C double bond).\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The presence of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the existence of the **alkene** group, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The fragment at m/z = 45 corresponds to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment (12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). This strongly confirms the presence of the **carboxylic acid** group.\n\n4.  **Putting It All Together:**\n    *   The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. It must contain **two oxygen atoms** and have **two degrees of unsaturation** (one for the C=O in the acid and one for the C=C in the alkene).\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options (as confirmed by the code output):**\n    *   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** Has 2 oxygens (✓), but the Degree of Unsaturation is 1 (✗). This would be a saturated carboxylic acid.\n    *   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** Only has 1 oxygen (✗). Cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **C) C₆H₁₀O₂:** Has 2 oxygens (✓) and the Degree of Unsaturation is 2 (✓). This fits all the spectroscopic evidence.\n    *   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** Only has 1 oxygen (✗). Cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\nThe only chemical formula that fits all the data is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>"
