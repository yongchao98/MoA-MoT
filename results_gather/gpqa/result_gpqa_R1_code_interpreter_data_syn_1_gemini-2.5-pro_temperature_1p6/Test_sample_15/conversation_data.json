    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the optical activity of each compound. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key is to look for chiral centers and the absence of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule has a C=C double bond. The atoms of the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C of methyl, C of ethyl) all lie in the same plane.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This planar arrangement creates a plane of symmetry that is the plane of the molecule itself.\n    *   **Chirality:** Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers (the bridgehead carbons). This designation refers to a single, specific enantiomer of a chiral compound. A meso compound (an achiral compound with chiral centers) would not be named this way.\n    *   **Chirality:** Since a specific enantiomer is named, the compound must be chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is a single enantiomer, so it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has the general structure X-CH(Y)-CH(Y)-X. When the configurations of the two identical chiral centers are opposite (one R, one S), the molecule possesses internal symmetry. In a specific conformation, it has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3. It also has a center of inversion.\n    *   **Chirality:** A compound with chiral centers but which is achiral overall due to internal symmetry is called a meso compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a meso compound, which is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a diastereomer of the compound above. It has two chiral centers, C2 and C3.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The configurations of the two identical chiral centers are the same (both R). This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   **Chirality:** It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, which is non-superimposable. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is a single enantiomer and is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group.\n    *   **Chirality:** Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH=CH- (ring path 1), and -CH2-CH2- (ring path 2). Since these four groups are different, C1 is a chiral center. The `(R)` in the name specifies a single enantiomer. The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is a single enantiomer and is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation (an older system) indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all cis).\n    *   **Symmetry:** This highly symmetric molecule possesses multiple symmetry elements. In its stable all-equatorial chair conformation, there is a C3 axis of rotation and three vertical planes of symmetry (σv). Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH bond and the opposing C-H bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are prochiral, not chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** Based on IUPAC nomenclature rules, the name corresponds to the structure `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. This is also known as isobutyl cyclopentyl ketone.\n    *   **Symmetry:** We need to check for chirality. There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The `CH(CH3)2` carbon is bonded to two identical methyl groups. The rest of the molecule is also symmetric. The isobutyl group has a plane of symmetry, and the cyclopentyl ketone part also has a plane of symmetry. These planes can be aligned through free rotation around the single bonds.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: **Inactive**\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-...dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Inactive** (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: **Inactive**\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: **Inactive**\n\nCounting the number of optically active compounds, we find there are 3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
