    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial conditions:**\n    *   We start with an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. \"Equimolar\" means moles(A) = moles(B) = n.\n    *   The total weight of the mixture is 7.20 g. So, n * M_A + n * M_B = 7.20 g, where M_A and M_B are the molar masses of the salts.\n\n2.  **Analyze the decomposition reaction and gas processing:**\n    *   The salts are heated and decompose completely into a mixture of gases. The fact that only gases are formed suggests the salts are likely composed of non-metals, such as ammonium salts.\n    *   The gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes, and we analyze the changes in each.\n\n3.  **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a strong dehydrating agent and absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n4.  **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater)**\n    *   This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, or NO₂.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were present in the gas mixture.\n\n5.  **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, and the tube's weight increases by 0.80 g. This increase is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since the gas passed through the Ca(OH)₂ solution unchanged, it must be a neutral oxygen-containing gas. The most common one in this context is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n    *   Based on the stoichiometry of N₂O, the moles of N₂O that reacted are equal to the moles of oxygen atoms. Thus, moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This reaction also produces 0.05 moles of nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n6.  **Final Gas C:**\n    *   The remaining gas, C, has a volume of 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   Gas C is what remains after passing through all tubes. It must be inert. Nitrogen (N₂) fits this description.\n    *   This 0.1 mol of N₂ (Gas C) is the sum of any N₂ produced directly from the initial decomposition and the N₂ produced in tube №3 from the reduction of N₂O.\n    *   Total N₂ = N₂(direct) + N₂(from N₂O)\n    *   0.1 mol = N₂(direct) + 0.05 mol\n    *   Solving for N₂(direct), we find that 0.05 mol of N₂ was produced directly in the decomposition.\n\n7.  **Identify the Salts (A and B):**\n    *   Summary of decomposition products:\n        *   0.2 mol H₂O\n        *   0.05 mol N₂O\n        *   0.05 mol N₂\n    *   The elements involved are H, N, and O. This points towards ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. Let's consider the decomposition of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n        *   **Reaction 1:** NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n        *   **Reaction 2:** NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\n    *   These reactions produce the exact set of gases we identified. Let's see if an equimolar mixture matches the quantities.\n    *   Let salt A be NH₄NO₂ and salt B be NH₄NO₃. We had `n` moles of each.\n    *   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂, we get `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃, we get `n` moles of N₂O and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   Total products from the mixture: `n` moles N₂, `n` moles N₂O, and `4n` moles H₂O.\n    *   Comparing with our findings:\n        *   Moles N₂ = `n` = 0.05 mol\n        *   Moles N₂O = `n` = 0.05 mol\n        *   Moles H₂O = `4n` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.2 mol\n    *   The results match perfectly. So, we started with 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n8.  **Verify the Total Mass:**\n    *   Let's run a calculation to verify the initial mass from our identified salts.\n\n```python\n# Molar mass of NH4NO2 (Ammonium Nitrite)\nM_A = 14.01 * 2 + 1.008 * 4 + 16.00 * 2  # M(N)*2 + M(H)*4 + M(O)*2\n# Molar mass of NH4NO3 (Ammonium Nitrate)\nM_B = 14.01 * 2 + 1.008 * 4 + 16.00 * 3  # M(N)*2 + M(H)*4 + M(O)*3\n# Moles of each salt\nn = 0.05\n# Total mass = n * M_A + n * M_B\ntotal_mass = n * (M_A + M_B)\nprint(f'{total_mass=}')\n```\n<execute_output>\ntotal_mass=7.2048\n</execute_output>\nThe calculated total mass is 7.2048 g, which matches the given 7.20 g. Our identification of salts A and B is correct.\n\n9.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   The final step is to find the total number of atoms in the formulas of salt A and salt B.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products of Decomposition:**\n    The gas mixture is passed through three different reagents, and we can identify the components based on the reactions:\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is due to water.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, or NO₂. Since the weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed in the decomposition.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases. The formation of CuO means the gas contained oxygen. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen atoms.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   The gas that reacted must be neutral (passed through Tube №2 unchanged) and contain oxygen. The most likely candidate is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\n        *   According to the formula N₂O, one mole of the gas contains one mole of oxygen atoms. Therefore, 0.05 moles of N₂O must have reacted.\n        *   This reaction also produced 0.05 moles of N₂ gas.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** The final volume of gas is 2.24 L at STP. This corresponds to:\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n        *   This gas, having passed through all reactive tubes, must be inert. This is nitrogen (N₂).\n        *   The total amount of N₂ collected is 0.1 mol. This total includes the N₂ produced from the reaction in Tube №3 (0.05 mol) and any N₂ produced directly from the initial salt decomposition.\n        *   Moles of N₂ from decomposition = Total N₂ - N₂ from N₂O reaction = 0.1 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n2.  **Identify the Salts A and B:**\n    Let's summarize the products from the initial decomposition:\n    *   0.2 mol H₂O\n    *   0.05 mol N₂O\n    *   0.05 mol N₂\n\n    The elements involved are Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O). This suggests the salts are ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyacids. Let's consider the thermal decomposition of two such salts:\n    *   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\n\n    These two reactions produce the exact set of gases we have identified. Since the initial mixture was equimolar, let's assume we started with `n` moles of each salt.\n    *   Decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ produces `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   Decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ produces `n` moles of N₂O and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   The total products would be `n` moles of N₂, `n` moles of N₂O, and `4n` moles of H₂O.\n\n    Comparing this with our calculated moles:\n    *   Moles of N₂ = `n` = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of N₂O = `n` = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = `4n` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.2 mol\n\n    The results are perfectly consistent. Thus, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of salt A (NH₄NO₂) and 0.05 mol of salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n\n3.  **Verify the Total Mass:**\n    Let's check if the mass of 0.05 mol of each salt equals the given total mass of 7.20 g.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = (14.01 * 2) + (1.008 * 4) + (16.00 * 2) = 64.05 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = (14.01 * 2) + (1.008 * 4) + (16.00 * 3) = 80.05 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.05 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.05 g/mol)\n    *   Total mass = 3.2025 g + 4.0025 g = 7.205 g.\n    This matches the given mass of 7.20 g.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    The question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salt A and salt B.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n    **Total atoms in both salts = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\n<<<B>>>"
