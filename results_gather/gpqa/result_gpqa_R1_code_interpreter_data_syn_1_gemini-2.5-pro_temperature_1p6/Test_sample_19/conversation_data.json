    "The user is asking to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics.\n\nHere is the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the term \"Impulse Approximation\":**\n    *   **Impulse:** In physics, an impulse is a large force acting for a very short time. This suggests that the interaction with the nucleon is very rapid.\n    *   **Approximation:** It's not an exact description but a simplification of the complex reality of a many-body system.\n    *   **Core idea:** The approximation treats a reaction with a nucleus as a collection of reactions with individual, quasi-free nucleons. The fundamental idea is that the interaction with a single nucleon happens so quickly that the rest of the nucleus doesn't have time to react or interfere.\n\n2.  **Analyze each assumption in the context of this core idea:**\n\n    *   **Assumption 1: \"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n        *   This is the very foundation of the impulse approximation. If the probe (e.g., an electron, a neutrino) could interact with multiple nucleons at once (these are called \"meson-exchange currents\" or \"two-body currents\"), then the picture of a simple interaction with a single, isolated nucleon breaks down. Therefore, this assumption is essential. It isolates the event to a one-body process within the nucleus.\n\n    *   **Assumption 2: \"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n        *   This addresses what happens before and after the primary interaction. If the nucleus were not transparent, the incoming probe might scatter before hitting the target nucleon (initial-state interactions), or the struck nucleon might scatter off its neighbors on its way out of the nucleus (final-state interactions, FSI). FSI would change the energy and momentum of the ejected nucleon, so it would no longer behave like a free particle escaping the interaction. To approximate the nucleon as \"free,\" we must assume it doesn't re-interact. Therefore, this assumption is essential for the simplest form of the impulse approximation (often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation, or PWIA).\n\n    *   **Assumption 3: \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n        *   This assumption concerns the *internal structure* of the nucleon itself, describing it with a particular model (the non-relativistic quark model). The impulse approximation, however, is about the nucleon's behavior *within the nuclear medium*. It treats the nucleon as the fundamental particle of the interaction. One can apply the impulse approximation regardless of whether the nucleon is considered a point particle, a relativistic system of quarks and gluons (described by parton distribution functions), or a non-relativistic system of quarks. This assumption is at a different level of theory (hadron structure vs. nuclear dynamics) and is not a necessary component of the impulse approximation itself.\n\n    *   **Assumption 4: \"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n        *   A nucleon inside a nucleus is bound by the strong nuclear force. This means it has a binding energy (it's \"off-shell\"). The impulse approximation assumes the interaction is so energetic and rapid (the \"impulse\") that the binding energy is negligible compared to the energy transferred. The nucleon is effectively \"knocked out\" before the slower-acting binding forces from neighboring nucleons can have an effect *during* the brief interaction. This is a crucial part of treating the nucleon as \"free\" at the interaction vertex.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the results:**\n    *   Assumption 1 is required to define the interaction as a one-on-one event.\n    *   Assumption 2 is required to treat the nucleon's trajectory after the event as free.\n    *   Assumption 4 is required to treat the nucleon's state during the event as free.\n    *   Assumption 3 is not required; it's an unrelated modeling choice for the nucleon's internal structure.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
