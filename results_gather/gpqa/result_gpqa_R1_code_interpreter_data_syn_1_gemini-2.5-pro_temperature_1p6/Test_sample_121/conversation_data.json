    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride (Ac2O) with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents points towards an alpha-halogenation of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group. The reaction brominates this carbon.\n*   CH3COOH + Br2 --(pyridine, Ac2O, heat)--> Br-CH2-COOH\n*   **Product 1 is bromoacetic acid.**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH --(H+)--> BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + H2O\n*   **Product 2 is ethyl bromoacetate.**\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile, and the bromine atom is a good leaving group. This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction.\n*   BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN --> NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 + NaBr\n*   **Product 3 is ethyl cyanoacetate.**\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOEt), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step process involving deprotonation and alkylation, similar to a malonic ester synthesis.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the alpha-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. The hydrogens on this carbon are acidic because they are alpha to both a cyano group and an ester carbonyl group.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH --> [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br --> NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since *excess* NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic hydrogen on the alpha-carbon of the newly formed intermediate.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH --> [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The carbanion in this intermediate attacks the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This forms a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4 is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.**\n\n**Structure of Product 4:**\n```\n      COOCH2CH3\n      |\n    C(CN)\n   /   \\\nH2C--CH2\n|    |\nH2C--CH2\n \\   /\n  CH2\n```\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry and stereochemistry.\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This rapid interconversion creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the carbon with the CN and COOEt groups) and C4 (the opposite carbon). Because of this symmetry, the molecule is achiral on the NMR timescale.\n    *   This plane of symmetry makes the two sides of the ring equivalent. Therefore, C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5. C1 and C4 are unique.\n\n2.  **Counting the Signals:** We must consider diastereotopicity.\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        *   **-CH3:** The three methyl protons are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce one signal (a triplet). **(1 signal)**\n        *   **-OCH2-:** The two methylene protons are adjacent to the rest of the molecule, which is achiral. We can test if they are equivalent by replacing one with deuterium (D). Replacing one H gives one enantiomer, and replacing the other H gives the other enantiomer. Protons that are interchangeable by forming enantiomers are called **enantiotopic**. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment. Thus, they produce one signal (a quartet). **(1 signal)**\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   **C2 and C6:** These two -CH2- groups are equivalent by symmetry. However, within the CH2 group at C2, the two protons (one axial, one equatorial in any given chair form) are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation. They are **diastereotopic** and thus chemically distinct. The plane of symmetry relates the two diastereotopic protons on C2 to the corresponding protons on C6. This results in two distinct signals for these four protons total (one signal for the two \"axial-like\" protons, one for the two \"equatorial-like\" protons). **(2 signals)**\n        *   **C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. These two -CH2- groups are equivalent by symmetry, but the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. This results in two distinct signals for these four protons. **(2 signals)**\n        *   **C4:** This -CH2- group is unique. The two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic (their relationship to the substituents on C1 is different). Therefore, they are chemically distinct and will give two separate signals. **(2 signals)**\n\n3.  **Total Count:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH3) + 1 (OCH2) = 2 signals\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n    *   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**"
