    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to determine the enthalpy of formation of the given compound.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's analyze the structure to count the number of Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n*   **(CH3)2C=**: This group contains 1 central carbon atom and 2 methyl (CH3) groups. Total: 3 C, 6 H.\n*   **=CH-**: This group contains 1 C and 1 H.\n*   **-CH2-**: This group contains 1 C and 2 H.\n*   **-CH(CH3)-**: This group contains 1 carbon in the main chain, 1 hydrogen on it, and one attached methyl group (1 C, 3 H). Total: 2 C, 4 H.\n*   **-CH2-**: This group contains 1 C and 2 H.\n*   **-CH=**: This group contains 1 C and 1 H.\n*   **=C(CH3)2**: This group contains 1 central carbon atom and 2 methyl (CH3) groups. Total: 3 C, 6 H.\n\nSumming these up:\n*   Total Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **12 C**\n*   Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 H**\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Bonds in the Molecule**\n\nBased on the structure, we can count the number of each type of covalent bond:\n\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C double bonds**: There are two double bonds in the structure: (CH3)2**C=C**H- and -C**H=C**(CH3)2. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds**: We need to count all single bonds between carbon atoms.\n    *   Bonds within the main chain: There are 4 single bonds linking the carbons between the double-bonded segments (C=**C-C-C-C-C**=C).\n    *   Bonds to methyl groups:\n        *   The (CH3)2C= group has 2 C-C bonds to the methyl groups.\n        *   The -CH(CH3)- group has 1 C-C bond to the methyl group.\n        *   The =C(CH3)2 group has 2 C-C bonds to the methyl groups.\n    *   Total C-C single bonds = 4 (chain) + 2 + 1 + 2 (methyls) = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Summary of bonds:**\n*   C-H bonds: 22\n*   C=C bonds: 2\n*   C-C bonds: 9\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy Change**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) can be calculated using the following formula involving bond energies and enthalpies of atomization:\n\nΔH_f = (Σ Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Σ Bond energies of the product)\n\n**Step 3a: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of reactants.**\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard state is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nTo form gaseous atoms from the reactants, we need to:\n*   Convert 12 moles of solid carbon to gaseous carbon: 12 × ΔH_at(C)\n*   Break 11 moles of H2 molecules into gaseous hydrogen atoms: 11 × BE(H-H)\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization of reactants = (12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 mol × 100 kJ/mol)\n= 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 3b: Calculate the total bond energy of the product.**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the C12H22 molecule.\nTotal Bond Energy = (9 × BE_C-C) + (2 × BE_C=C) + (22 × BE_C-H)\n= (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\n= 1800 kJ + 600 kJ + 8800 kJ = **11200 kJ**\n\n**Step 3c: Calculate the enthalpy of formation.**\nΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of product)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Convert to the Correct Units**\n\nThe options are given in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. Let's convert our result to kJ/g to check against the options.\n\n*   Molar Mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.446 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\nThe following Python code automates the calculation to verify the result.\n```python\n# Given values from the problem\nenthalpy_atomization_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_HH = 100         # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CC_single = 200  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CC_double = 300  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CH = 400         # kJ/mol\n\n# Atom counts for the molecule C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Number of moles of H2 in the formation reaction\nnum_H2 = num_H / 2\n\n# Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of reactants (12 C(s) + 11 H2(g))\nenthalpy_atomization_reactants = (num_C * enthalpy_atomization_C) + (num_H2 * bond_energy_HH)\n\n# Bond counts in the product molecule C12H22\nnum_CC_single = 9\nnum_CC_double = 2\nnum_CH = 22\n\n# Calculate the total bond energy of the product molecule\ntotal_bond_energy_product = (num_CC_single * bond_energy_CC_single) + \\\n                            (num_CC_double * bond_energy_CC_double) + \\\n                            (num_CH * bond_energy_CH)\n\n# Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\ndH_f_per_mol = enthalpy_atomization_reactants - total_bond_energy_product\n\n# Calculate the molar mass of C12H22 (using integer masses C=12, H=1)\nmolar_mass = (num_C * 12) + (num_H * 1)\n\n# Convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g\ndH_f_per_gram = dH_f_per_mol / molar_mass\n\nprint(f\"The enthalpy of formation is {dH_f_per_mol} kJ/mol.\")\nprint(f\"The enthalpy of formation is {dH_f_per_gram:.2f} kJ/g.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. The enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.\n\nThe formation reaction is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies and enthalpies of atomization with the following formula:\n\nΔH_f = (Σ Enthalpies of atomization of reactants) - (Σ Bond energies of the product)\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and count all bonds.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:**\n    The structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n    Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 (in chain) + 1 (in CH3) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from (CH3)2) = **12 C**.\n    Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 H**.\n    So, the molecular formula is C12H22.\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds. Count = **2**.\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms. Count = **22**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** We need to count the single bonds between carbons.\n        *   (CH3)2C=: 2 C-C bonds\n        *   =C-C-: 1 C-C bond\n        *   -C-C-: 1 C-C bond\n        *   -C(CH3)-: 2 C-C bonds (one in the chain, one to the methyl group)\n        *   -C-C-: 1 C-C bond\n        *   -C=C(CH3)2: 2 C-C bonds\n        *   Total C-C single bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of reactants.**\nThe reactants are 12 moles of solid carbon (C(s)) and 11 moles of hydrogen gas (H2(g)).\n*   Energy to atomize carbon = 12 mol × ΔH_at(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   Energy to atomize hydrogen = 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n*   Total enthalpy of atomization = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total bond energy of the product (C12H22).**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ.\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ.\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ.\n*   Total bond energy of the product = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f).**\nΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of product)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the result with the given options.**\nThe options are provided in kJ/mol and kJ/g. We need to convert our result to kJ/g.\n*   Molar mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12.01 g/mol) + (22 × 1.008 g/mol) ≈ 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   ΔH_f in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.45 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option B. The small difference is due to rounding or the use of integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) in the calculation.\n\n*   Option A (11200 kJ/mol) is the total bond energy of the product, not the enthalpy of formation.\n*   Option C (67.4 kJ/mol) is incorrect.\n*   Option D (1900 kJ/g) is incorrect; the unit should be kJ/mol.\n\nThus, the correct answer is 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<B>>>"
