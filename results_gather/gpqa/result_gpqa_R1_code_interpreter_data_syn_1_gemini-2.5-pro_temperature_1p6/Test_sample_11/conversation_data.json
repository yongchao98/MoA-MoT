    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Process:**\n    The problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion ($Pi^+$) into a positive muon ($mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($nu$). The reaction is:\n    $Pi^+ -> mu^+ + nu$\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   The pion ($Pi^+$) is stationary. This is a key piece of information.\n    *   Rest mass of $Pi^+$ ($m_{pi}$) = 139.6 MeV/c$^2$. This is equivalent to its rest energy, $m_{pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV.\n    *   Rest mass of $mu^+$ ($m_{mu}$) = 105.7 MeV/c$^2$. This is equivalent to its rest energy, $m_{mu}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV.\n    *   The neutrino ($nu$) is typically considered massless in such problems unless specified otherwise. So, $m_{nu} = 0$.\n\n3.  **Apply Fundamental Conservation Laws:**\n    This is a classic relativistic decay problem that can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n        *   Before the decay, the pion is stationary, so the total initial momentum is zero ($p_{initial} = 0$).\n        *   After the decay, the total final momentum must also be zero ($p_{final} = 0$).\n        *   The final momentum is the vector sum of the muon's momentum ($p_{mu}$) and the neutrino's momentum ($p_{nu}$).\n        *   $p_{mu} + p_{nu} = 0$, which implies $p_{mu} = -p_{nu}$.\n        *   This means the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude $p$, so $|p_{mu}| = |p_{nu}| = p$.\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:**\n        *   The total energy before the decay is just the rest energy of the stationary pion: $E_{initial} = m_{pi}c^2$.\n        *   The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon ($E_{mu}$) and the neutrino ($E_{nu}$): $E_{final} = E_{mu} + E_{nu}$.\n        *   Therefore, $m_{pi}c^2 = E_{mu} + E_{nu}$.\n\n4.  **Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    The total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) of a particle are related by:\n    $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$\n\n    *   For the muon ($mu^+$):\n        $E_{mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the neutrino ($nu$), since we assume its mass is zero ($m_{nu} = 0$):\n        $E_{nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0} = pc$\n\n5.  **Set Up and Solve the Equations:**\n    We now have a system of equations. We can substitute the expressions for $E_{mu}$ and $E_{nu}$ into the energy conservation equation:\n    $m_{pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n    Our goal is to find the kinetic energies, $KE_{mu}$ and $KE_{nu}$. Let's first solve for the momentum, $pc$.\n    1.  Rearrange the equation: $m_{pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2}$\n    2.  Square both sides: $(m_{pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2$\n    3.  Expand the left side: $(m_{pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2$\n    4.  The $(pc)^2$ term cancels out on both sides: $(m_{pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{mu}c^2)^2$\n    5.  Solve for $pc$: $pc = \\frac{(m_{pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{pi}c^2)}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energies:**\n\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{nu}$):**\n        The kinetic energy of a massless particle is equal to its total energy.\n        $KE_{nu} = E_{nu} = pc$.\n        So, we can use the formula derived above for $pc$.\n        $KE_{nu} = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6}$\n\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{mu}$):**\n        We can find this using the conservation of energy equation.\n        $m_{pi}c^2 = E_{mu} + E_{nu} = (KE_{mu} + m_{mu}c^2) + KE_{nu}$\n        Rearranging for $KE_{mu}$:\n        $KE_{mu} = m_{pi}c^2 - m_{mu}c^2 - KE_{nu}$\n\n7.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    To get precise values, a script is helpful.\n\n```python\n# Rest masses in MeV/c^2 (equivalent to rest energies in MeV)\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # MeV\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu) using the derived formula.\n# KE_nu = (m_pi_c2^2 - m_mu_c2^2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\nke_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu) from energy conservation.\n# KE_mu = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2 - KE_nu\nke_mu = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2 - ke_nu\n\n# The problem asks for KE of product particles: muon (mu+) and neutrino (nu)\n# We present the results in the order: KE of muon, KE of neutrino\nprint(f\"KE of mu(+): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of nu: {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nKE of mu(+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of nu: 29.78 MeV\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated kinetic energies are approximately:\n    *   $KE_{mu} \\approx 4.12$ MeV\n    *   $KE_{nu} \\approx 29.78$ MeV, which rounds to 29.8 MeV.\n\n    Now, let's check the given options:\n    A) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n    B) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n    C) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n    D) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\n    The calculated values (4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV) match option A perfectly. The order in the option matches the order in the reaction ($mu^+$, then $nu$).\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Based on the conservation of energy and momentum for the decay of a stationary particle, the kinetic energies of the two product particles were calculated.\n\nThe decay process is:\n$Pi^+ -> mu^+ + nu$\n\nGiven:\n*   Rest energy of $Pi^+$ ($m_{\\pi}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest energy of $mu^+$ ($m_{\\mu}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV\n*   The $Pi^+$ is stationary.\n\nFrom the conservation laws, we derived the formulas for the kinetic energies:\n1.  **Kinetic Energy of the neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):**\n    $KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2 m_{\\pi}c^2}$\n\n2.  **Kinetic Energy of the muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):**\n    $KE_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2 - KE_{\\nu}$\n\nThe Python script executed these calculations:\n```\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\nke_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\nke_mu = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2 - ke_nu\n```\nThe output of the script was:\n*   KE of mu(+): 4.12 MeV\n*   KE of nu: 29.78 MeV\n\nRounding the neutrino's kinetic energy to one decimal place gives 29.8 MeV.
