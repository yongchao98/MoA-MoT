    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant chemical equilibrium.**\n    The problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n\n    The formation reaction is:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n\n    The corresponding formation constant ($K_f$, also given as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    The dissociation reaction we are interested in is:\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    We start with a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, $[CaY]^{2-}$. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates at equilibrium. According to the stoichiometry of the reaction, for every mole of $[CaY]^{2-}$ that dissociates, one mole of $Ca^{2+}$ and one mole of $Y^{4-}$ are formed.\n\n    | Species | Initial (I) | Change (C) | Equilibrium (E) |\n    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n    | $[CaY]^{2-}$ | 0.02 M | -x | 0.02 - x |\n    | $Ca^{2+}$ | 0 M | +x | x |\n    | $Y^{4-}$ | 0 M | +x | x |\n\n3.  **Apply the equilibrium constant expression.**\n    Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n4.  **Simplify and solve for x.**\n    The formation constant $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$ is very large. This indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the left (favoring the complex), and therefore the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M).\n    This allows us to make the approximation: $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we can rearrange the equation to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the final concentration.**\n    To find x, which represents the concentration of calcium ions $[Ca^{2+}]$, we take the square root:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n\n    To perform the calculation easily, this can be written as:\n    $x = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}} = \\sqrt{40} \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n    Since $\\sqrt{36} = 6$ and $\\sqrt{49} = 7$, $\\sqrt{40}$ is approximately 6.3.\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n    So, the concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option A.\n\nThe use of a script can provide a more precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# We need to solve the quadratic equation derived from the equilibrium expression:\n# K_f = (initial_complex_conc - x) / x^2\n# K_f * x^2 = initial_complex_conc - x\n# K_f * x^2 + x - initial_complex_conc = 0\n# This is a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0\n# where a = K_f, b = 1, c = -initial_complex_conc\n\na = K_f\nb = 1\nc = -initial_complex_conc\n\n# Using the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)\n# Since x (concentration) must be positive, we only use the '+' root.\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\nx = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, in a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n**1. Dissociation Reaction and Equilibrium Constant:**\nThe complex $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$ (represented as $[CaY]^{2-}$) dissociates according to the following equilibrium:\n$[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\nThe given formation constant ($K_f$) for the complex is:\n$K_f = K_{Ca-EDTA} = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n**2. Setting up the Equilibrium Concentrations:**\nLet 'x' be the concentration of $[CaY]^{2-}$ that dissociates. At equilibrium:\n*   $[Ca^{2+}] = x$\n*   $[Y^{4-}] = x$\n*   $[[CaY]^{2-}] = 0.02 - x$\n\n**3. Applying the Equilibrium Expression:**\nSubstitute these concentrations into the formation constant equation:\n$5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{x \\cdot x} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n**4. Solving for x:**\nBecause the formation constant $K_f$ is very large, the dissociation 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex. Thus, we can make the approximation:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n$5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\nRearranging to solve for $x^2$:\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\nSolving for x, which is the concentration of calcium ions $[Ca^{2+}]$:\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}} = \\sqrt{40} \\times 10^{-7} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nThe calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.
