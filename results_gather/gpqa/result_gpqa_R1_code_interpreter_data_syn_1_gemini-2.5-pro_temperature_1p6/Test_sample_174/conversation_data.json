    "An oscillating charge distribution, as described, is a source of electromagnetic radiation. Let's analyze the properties of this radiation.\n\n**1. Modeling the Radiating Source**\n\nThe problem states we have an oscillating charge distribution that is spheroid in shape, with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. The oscillation is implied to be along this axis. For wavelengths (λ) much larger than the size of the spheroid, this system can be accurately modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The dipole moment, **p**, oscillates along the z-axis: **p**(t) = p₀ cos(ωt) **ẑ**.\n\n**2. Angular Distribution of Radiated Power**\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) from an oscillating electric dipole aligned with the z-axis is given by the formula:\n\ndP/dΩ = f(λ, θ) = C * sin²(θ)\n\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n*   C is a constant of proportionality that depends on the frequency (and thus wavelength λ) and the amplitude of the dipole moment (p₀), but not on the angle θ.\nThe function f(λ, θ) represents this radiated power per unit solid angle.\n\n**3. Calculating the Fraction of Maximum Power**\n\n*   **Maximum Power (A):** The radiated power is maximum when the term sin²(θ) is maximum. The maximum value of sin²(θ) is 1, which occurs when θ = 90° (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    A = (dP/dΩ)_max = f(λ, 90°) = C * sin²(90°) = C * (1)² = C.\n    So, the maximum power radiated, A, is equal to the constant C.\n\n*   **Power at θ = 30°:** We need to find the power radiated at an angle of 30° to the z-axis.\n    (dP/dΩ) at 30° = f(λ, 30°) = C * sin²(30°).\n\n*   **Fraction of Maximum Power:** The fraction of A radiated at 30° is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power A.\n    Fraction = [f(λ, 30°)] / A = [C * sin²(30°)] / C = sin²(30°).\n\n    We know that sin(30°) = 1/2.\n    Therefore, the fraction is (1/2)² = 1/4.\n\nThis result eliminates options A and B.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Calculate the value of sin^2(30 degrees)\ntheta_degrees = 30\n# Convert degrees to radians for numpy's sin function\ntheta_radians = np.deg2rad(theta_degrees)\n# Calculate sin^2(theta)\nfraction = np.sin(theta_radians)**2\n\nprint(f\"The fraction sin^2(30) is: {fraction}\")\n```\n\n**4. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe radiated power from an electric dipole is proportional to the square of the acceleration of the charge. For an oscillation with angular frequency ω, the acceleration is proportional to ω². The radiated electric field E is proportional to the acceleration, so E ∝ ω². The power, which is proportional to the square of the electric field (P ∝ E²), is therefore proportional to (ω²)² = ω⁴.\n\nP ∝ ω⁴\n\nThe angular frequency ω is related to the wavelength λ by the equation ω = 2πc/λ, where c is the speed of light. Substituting this into the power relation:\n\nP ∝ (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴ = λ⁻⁴\n\nThis means the function f(λ, θ) has a λ⁻⁴ dependence. This is a characteristic feature of electric dipole radiation, also known as Rayleigh scattering.\n\nCombining our two findings:\n*   The fraction of maximum power at θ = 30° is 1/4.\n*   A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the radiated power f is λ⁻⁴.\n\nThese two results correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An oscillating spheroid-shaped charge distribution can be approximated as an oscillating electric dipole, especially when the wavelength of radiation (λ) is much larger than the size of the spheroid. Let's assume the oscillation occurs along the z-axis, which is the axis of symmetry.\n\n**Part 1: Fraction of Radiated Power**\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) by an oscillating electric dipole aligned with the z-axis is given by the Larmor formula for an accelerating charge, which results in:\n\ndP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)\n\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n*   C is a constant that depends on the amplitude and frequency of the oscillation, but not on the angle θ.\n\nThe function `f` mentioned in the problem is this radiated power per unit solid angle, so `f(λ, θ) = C * sin²(θ)`.\n\nThe maximum radiated power, `A`, occurs where the `sin²(θ)` term is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which happens at θ = 90° (in the xy-plane, perpendicular to the oscillation).\n\nA = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * (1)² = C\n\nNow, we need to find the power radiated at an angle θ = 30° and express it as a fraction of the maximum power A.\n\nPower at 30° = C * sin²(30°)\n\nThe fraction of A is:\nFraction = (Power at 30°) / A = (C * sin²(30°)) / C = sin²(30°)\n\nWe know that sin(30°) = 1/2.\nTherefore, the fraction is (1/2)² = 1/4.\n\nThis result narrows down the possible answers to options C and D.\n\n**Part 2: Form of the function f**\n\nThe radiated power from an oscillating dipole is proportional to the square of the acceleration of the charges. For a sinusoidal oscillation with angular frequency ω, the position is `z(t) = z₀cos(ωt)`, the velocity is `v(t) = -z₀ωsin(ωt)`, and the acceleration is `a(t) = -z₀ω²cos(ωt)`.\n\nThe radiated power is proportional to the square of the acceleration, so P ∝ a² ∝ (ω²)² = ω⁴.\n\nThe angular frequency ω is related to the wavelength λ by the formula ω = 2πc/λ, where c is the speed of light.\n\nSubstituting this into our power relation:\nP ∝ (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴ = λ⁻⁴\n\nThis means that the radiated power per unit solid angle, f, is proportional to λ⁻⁴. This type of scattering is known as Rayleigh scattering.\n\nTherefore, a possible form for `f` includes a λ⁻⁴ dependence.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining our two findings:\n1.  The fraction of maximum power at θ = 30° is 1/4.\n2.  A possible form for the wavelength dependence of `f` is λ⁻⁴.\n\nThese results match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
