    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product.**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. Its structure is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne (C≡CH group). Let's denote the cyclohexyl group as 'Cy'. So, the structure is Cy-C≡CH.\n    *   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's dissect this IUPAC name:\n        *   The parent molecule is \"cyclohexanecarbaldehyde\". This is a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde (-CHO) group attached. The ring carbon atom attached to the -CHO group is designated as C1.\n        *   The substituent is \"(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)\". This group's structure is -CH(OH)-Cy.\n        *   The position of the substituent is \"1-\". This means the substituent is attached to the C1 atom of the parent cyclohexane ring.\n        *   So, the structure has a cyclohexane ring where the C1 atom is bonded to four different groups: C2 of the ring, C6 of the ring, a -CHO group, and a -CH(OH)-Cy group. This is a quaternary carbon center.\n\n2.  **Determine the Overall Transformation.**\n    *   We start with Cy-C≡CH (formula C8H12).\n    *   The final product is the result of joining two cyclohexane-containing units. The reaction is a self-aldol condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO).\n    *   Let's verify this. In a base-catalyzed aldol reaction, a base removes an alpha-proton (a proton on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl) from one aldehyde molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule.\n        *   Aldehyde: Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO). The alpha-carbon is C1 of the cyclohexane ring, and it has one alpha-proton.\n        *   Step 1 (Enolate formation): A base removes the alpha-proton from C1 of one Cy-CHO molecule.\n        *   Step 2 (Nucleophilic attack): The resulting enolate (nucleophile) attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second Cy-CHO molecule. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C1 of the first molecule and the carbonyl carbon of the second.\n        *   Step 3 (Protonation): The intermediate alkoxide is protonated (usually by the solvent) to give the final β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n    *   The resulting structure is a cyclohexane ring (from the nucleophile) that has a -CHO group and a -CH(OH)-Cy group attached to its C1 carbon. This perfectly matches the structure derived from the product name.\n    *   Therefore, the overall synthetic strategy must be:\n        1.  Synthesize cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane.\n        2.  Perform a self-aldol condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences.**\n    The core of the problem now is to find the correct sequence to prepare cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO) from ethynylcyclohexane (Cy-C≡CH) and then perform the aldol reaction. This transformation involves cleaving the C≡C bond and adding a single carbon with an aldehyde group. This cannot be done directly. A common strategy is to lengthen the alkyne chain and then cleave it at a specific position using ozonolysis.\n\n    Let's analyze each option:\n\n    *   **A) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH:**\n        *   Step 1 (NaNH2, methanol): NaNH2 is a very strong base and will react with methanol (an acid) to form sodium methoxide. If it reacts with the alkyne first, it will form the acetylide (Cy-C≡C⁻), which will then be protonated by methanol, regenerating the starting material. This step is unproductive.\n\n    *   **B) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O:**\n        *   Step 1 (NaNH2, CH3Cl): This correctly performs an alkylation of the terminal alkyne: Cy-C≡CH → Cy-C≡C-CH3 (1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne).\n        *   Step 2 (H2/Pd): This is a strong reducing agent that would fully hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane: Cy-C≡C-CH3 → Cy-CH2-CH2-CH3 (propylcyclohexane). An alkane is very unreactive and cannot be easily converted to the target. This path is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH:**\n        *   Step 1 (NaNH2, C2H5Cl): Forms 1-cyclohexylbut-1-yne: Cy-C≡C-CH2CH3.\n        *   Step 2 (Li/liq. NH3): Reduces the internal alkyne to a trans-alkene: Cy-CH=CH-CH2CH3.\n        *   Step 3 (O3/H2O): Ozonolysis with an oxidative workup (H2O). This cleaves the double bond but oxidizes the resulting aldehydes to carboxylic acids. The products would be cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (Cy-COOH) and propanoic acid. An aldol reaction cannot be performed on carboxylic acids. Thus, this path is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2:**\n        *   Step 1 (NaNH2, CH3Cl): Forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne: Cy-C≡C-CH3. This is correct.\n        *   Step 2 (H2/Pd-CaCO3): This is Lindlar's catalyst, which reduces the internal alkyne to a cis-alkene: Cy-CH=CH-CH3. The stereochemistry is not critical for the next step. This is correct.\n        *   Step 3 (O3/(CH3)2S): Reductive ozonolysis. This cleaves the double bond to form aldehydes. The products are cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO) and acetaldehyde (CH3CHO). This is the correct way to make the required intermediate.\n        *   Step 4 (Ba(OH)2): This strong base will catalyze an aldol reaction. In the mixture of aldehydes, four products are possible. However, acetaldehyde is very volatile (b.p. 20°C) and can be easily removed by running the reaction at a slightly elevated temperature. This leaves cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to react with itself (self-condensation) to form the desired final product, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    Sequence D provides a chemically sound and logical pathway from the starting material to the final product. Each step employs standard and appropriate reagents for the intended transformation. The other options contain fatal flaws in their proposed steps.\n\n<<<D>>>"
