    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define Parallax and Distance:**\n    The parallax of a star, `plx`, is inversely proportional to its distance, `d`.\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    This means that `d = 1/plx`. For simplicity, let's denote parallax as `p`. So, `p = 1/d` and `d = 1/p`.\n\n2.  **Define Uniform Distribution:**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, `ρ` (the number of stars per unit volume), is constant throughout space.\n    `ρ = constant`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Number of Stars within a Given Distance:**\n    Let's find the total number of stars, `N`, within a sphere of radius `d`.\n    The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3) * π * d³`.\n    Since the density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars `N` within this volume is:\n    `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3) * π * d³`\n\n4.  **Relate the Number of Stars to Parallax:**\n    We want to express the number of stars as a function of parallax `p` instead of distance `d`. We can substitute `d = 1/p` into the equation for `N(d)`.\n    Let `N_c(p)` be the cumulative number of stars with a parallax greater than or equal to `p`. A parallax `≥ p` corresponds to a distance `d ≤ 1/p`. Therefore, `N_c(p)` is the number of stars within a radius `d = 1/p`.\n    `N_c(p) = ρ * (4/3) * π * (1/p)³ = (4πρ/3) * p⁻³`\n\n5.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax:**\n    The question asks for how the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* changes with parallax. This quantity is the distribution function (or number density with respect to parallax), which we can find by differentiating the cumulative number `N_c(p)` with respect to `p`. Let's call this distribution `n(p)`.\n    `n(p) = |dN_c(p) / dp|`\n\n    We take the absolute value because the number of stars must be a positive quantity, and `N_c(p)` decreases as `p` increases.\n\n6.  **Perform the Differentiation:**\n    `dN_c(p) / dp = d/dp [ (4πρ/3) * p⁻³ ]`\n    Using the power rule for differentiation (`d/dx(x^n) = n*x^(n-1)`), we get:\n    `dN_c(p) / dp = (4πρ/3) * (-3 * p⁻⁴) = -4πρ * p⁻⁴`\n\n7.  **Determine the Proportionality:**\n    Taking the absolute value gives the distribution `n(p)`:\n    `n(p) = |-4πρ * p⁻⁴| = 4πρ * p⁻⁴`\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `p⁻⁴`.\n    `n(p) ∝ p⁻⁴` or `n(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<A>>>"
