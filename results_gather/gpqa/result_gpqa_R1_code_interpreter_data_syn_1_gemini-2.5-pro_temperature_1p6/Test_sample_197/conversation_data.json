    "The user wants to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n1.  **Identify all cobalt-containing species:**\n    The problem provides stability constants `β1` through `β4`, which correspond to the formation of complexes with one to four thiocyanate ligands. The species in solution are:\n    *   `Co^2+` (free ion)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]^+`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]^-`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n\n2.  **Define the total cobalt concentration:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\n3.  **Use stability constants to express complex concentrations:**\n    The overall stability constants (`βn`) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion `[Co^2+]` and the free ligand `[SCN^-]`:\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\n4.  **Express total cobalt concentration in terms of `[Co^2+]`:**\n    Substitute the expressions from step 3 into the equation from step 2:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN^-]^4`\n    Factor out `[Co^2+]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the fraction of the `[Co(SCN)2]` species:**\n    The percentage of a specific species is its concentration divided by the total concentration, multiplied by 100. We are interested in `[Co(SCN)2]`. The fraction, `α2`, is:\n    `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n    Substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)2]]` and `c(Co)`:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4))`\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n6.  **Plug in the given values and calculate:**\n    *   `[SCN^-] = 0.1 M`\n    *   `β1 = 9`\n    *   `β2 = 40`\n    *   `β3 = 63`\n    *   `β4 = 16`\n    The total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10^-2 M` is not needed for calculating the percentage distribution, as it cancels out.\n\nLet's use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given values for the stability constants and ligand concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# The term for the species of interest, [Co(SCN)2], in the distribution equation\nnumerator = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\n\n# The sum of all terms for all species (the denominator of the distribution equation)\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * scn_conc) + (beta2 * scn_conc**2) + (beta3 * scn_conc**3) + (beta4 * scn_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)2]\nfraction = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = fraction * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n>>>\n16.91618032648228\n<<<\nThe calculation shows that the fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, is approximately 0.16916, which corresponds to 16.916%.

    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, we need to find the fraction of this species relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species and then express it as a percentage.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify all cobalt-containing species:**\n    In a solution containing Co²⁺ and SCN⁻ ions, a series of complexes will form. The species present are:\n    *   Free Co²⁺ ion\n    *   Monothiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n    *   Dithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)2]`\n    *   Trithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)3]⁻`\n    *   Tetrathiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)4]²⁻`\n\n2.  **Define the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of the concentrations of all the species listed above:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)4]²⁻]`\n\n3.  **Use stability constants (β) to express concentrations:**\n    The overall stability constants `βn` are defined by the equilibrium: `Co²⁺ + n SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)`.\n    The expression for each `βn` is: `βn = [[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)] / ([Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]^n)`.\n    We can rearrange these to express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free Co²⁺ and free SCN⁻ concentrations:\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n4.  **Express `c(Co)` in terms of `[Co²⁺]` and `[SCN⁻]`:**\n    Substitute the expressions from step 3 into the equation from step 2:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n    Factoring out `[Co²⁺]` gives:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the fraction of the `[Co(SCN)2]` species:**\n    The percentage we want is `([[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)) * 100`. Let's first find the fraction, denoted as `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n    Substituting the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)2]]` and `c(Co)`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, meaning the distribution of species only depends on the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, not the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`.\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n6.  **Substitute the given numerical values and calculate:**\n    *   `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`\n    *   `β₁ = 9`\n    *   `β₂ = 40`\n    *   `β₃ = 63`\n    *   `β₄ = 16`\n\n    Let's calculate the value of the numerator and the denominator. A Python script is efficient for this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1 # [SCN-] in M\n\n# Numerator of the fraction is the term for the desired species, [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\n\n# Denominator is the sum of terms for all species\n# The terms are: 1 (for Co2+), β1[SCN-], β2[SCN-]^2, β3[SCN-]^3, β4[SCN-]^4\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * scn_conc) + (beta2 * scn_conc**2) + (beta3 * scn_conc**3) + (beta4 * scn_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)2]\nfraction = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = fraction * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\nThe calculation performed by the code gives the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex. The output `16.916...%` is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, is calculated as the concentration of this species divided by the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species, multiplied by 100.\n\nLet L represent the thiocyanate ligand, SCN⁻. The fraction of the `[CoL₂]` species (`α₂`) in the mixture is given by the formula:\n\n`α₂ = (β₂[L]²) / (1 + β₁[L] + β₂[L]² + β₃[L]³ + β₄[L]⁴)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `[L]` is the concentration of the thiocyanate ligand, `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`.\n*   `β₁`, `β₂`, `β₃`, and `β₄` are the overall stability constants.\n\nGiven values:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\nLet's calculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   `β₁[L]` = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   `β₂[L]²` = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   `β₃[L]³` = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   `β₄[L]⁴` = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe denominator is the sum of these terms plus 1 (for the free Co²⁺ ion):\n`Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nThe numerator is the term for the `[Co(SCN)2]` species:\n`Numerator = β₂[L]² = 0.4`\n\nNow, calculate the fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:\n`Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
