    "This question asks which of the listed physical theories does not inherently suffer from infinities at high energies (ultraviolet divergences) that necessitate the mathematical procedure of regularization.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n1.  **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**: This is the quantum field theory of light and matter. When calculating physical quantities, such as the self-energy of an electron or the strength of its interaction with a magnetic field, one performs calculations involving \"virtual particles\" in loops. These loop integrals often diverge when considering contributions from particles with arbitrarily high energy (or, equivalently, interactions at arbitrarily short distances). To handle these infinities, a procedure called regularization (e.g., introducing a momentum cutoff or using dimensional regularization) is first used to make the integrals temporarily finite. Then, a process called renormalization is used to absorb these infinities into the definitions of physical constants like mass and charge, resulting in finite, predictive answers that match experiments with incredible accuracy. Therefore, QED *requires* regularization.\n\n2.  **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**: This is the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force, which governs quarks and gluons. Like QED, QCD is a quantum field theory, and its loop calculations also lead to ultraviolet divergences. These infinities are also handled by the combined process of regularization and renormalization. Therefore, QCD *requires* regularization.\n\n3.  **Classical Electrodynamics**: This theory, described by Maxwell's equations, runs into its own high-energy problem. If one treats an electron as a true point charge, the energy stored in its own electric field (its self-energy) is infinite. This is because the energy density of the electric field is proportional to E², and the electric field E is proportional to 1/r², so the total energy integral diverges as the radius r approaches zero. This is a classical divergence at short distances (high energies). To resolve this, one has to introduce a cutoff, for example, by postulating that the electron is not a point but a small sphere with a finite \"classical electron radius\". This introduction of a finite size is a form of regularization. Therefore, classical electrodynamics, in its point-particle formulation, *requires* a form of regularization to avoid infinities.\n\n4.  **Superstring Theory**: This is a theoretical framework that attempts to unify all fundamental forces of nature, including gravity. A key feature and motivation for string theory is that it is believed to be free of ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences. Unlike the other theories which are based on point particles, the fundamental entities in string theory are tiny, one-dimensional, vibrating strings. The interactions between these strings are not point-like but are \"smeared out\" over a small region of spacetime. This smearing effect naturally smooths out the short-distance interactions and tames the high-energy behavior of loop diagrams, leading to finite results for scattering amplitudes. For this reason, superstring theory is thought to be a UV-finite theory that *never requires* the artificial procedure of regularization.\n\n**Conclusion**: QED, QCD, and Classical Electrodynamics all encounter infinities at high energies/short distances that must be dealt with by regularization. Superstring Theory is specifically constructed to avoid this problem.\n\n<<<A>>>"
