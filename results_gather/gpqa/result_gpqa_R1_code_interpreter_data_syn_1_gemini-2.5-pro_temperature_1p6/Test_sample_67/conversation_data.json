    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State (t < 0)\nThe particle is spin-1/2 with magnetic moment `μ = γS`.\nInitially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the system is in its lowest energy state.\nThe Hamiltonian for `t < 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γS_z B`.\nThe energy of a state is given by `E = -γB <S_z>`. To be in the lowest energy state (aligned), the energy must be minimized.\n- If `γ > 0` (e.g., a proton), we need `<S_z>` to be maximum and positive. The spin-up state `|+z>` has `S_z = +ħ/2`, so `E = -γB(ħ/2)`. This is the ground state.\n- If `γ < 0` (e.g., an electron), `γ` is negative. To minimize `E`, `S_z` must be negative, so the spin-down state `|-z>` with `S_z = -ħ/2` is the ground state. `E = -|γ|B(-ħ/2)`. In this case, the magnetic moment `μ_z = γS_z = (-|γ|)(-ħ/2) = +|γ|ħ/2` is still positive and aligned with the B field.\n\nLet's proceed assuming the initial state is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. As we will see, the oscillation frequency does not depend on this choice. The state vector for `|+z>` in the z-basis is `[1, 0]^T`.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian (t > 0)\nAt `t = 0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+Y` direction with the same magnitude `B`.\nThe new Hamiltonian `H'` is `H' = -μ ⋅ B_new = -γB S_y`.\n`S_y` is the spin operator for the y-component. In the z-basis, the spin operators are represented by the Pauli matrices (`σ`) scaled by `ħ/2`: `S_i = (ħ/2)σ_i`.\n`S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\nSo, `H' = -γB(ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\nThe state evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iH't/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n`U(t) = exp(-i * [-γB(ħ/2)σ_y] * t / ħ) = exp(i * (γBt/2) * σ_y)`.\nLet `ω = γB`. This `ω` is the Larmor frequency. The expression becomes `U(t) = exp(i * (ωt/2) * σ_y)`.\nWe can use the identity `exp(iθ * σ_k) = cos(θ)I + i*sin(θ)σ_k`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\nHere, `θ = ωt/2`.\n`U(t) = cos(ωt/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i*sin(ωt/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n`U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + [[0, sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), 0]]`\n`U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]`\n\nNow, we find the state vector at time `t`:\n`|ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)> = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] * [1, 0]^T`\n`|ψ(t)> = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]^T`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value\nWe need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t)`.\n`<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)> = γ <S_z>(t)`.\nLet's calculate `<S_z>(t)`. The operator is `S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\nThe bra vector `<ψ(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ(t)>`, which is `[cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]`.\n`<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n`<S_z>(t) = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]^T`\n`<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * [cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)]^T`\n`<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))`\nUsing the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n`<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * ωt/2) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\n### 5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\nNow we can find `<μ_z>(t)`:\n`<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`\nSubstituting `ω = γB`:\n`<μ_z>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos((γB)t)`\nThe expression describes a simple harmonic oscillation of the form `Acos(Ωt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `Ω`.\nBy comparing the forms, we see the oscillation frequency `Ω = γB`.\n\nThis frequency is known as the Larmor frequency. It represents the precession frequency of the spin expectation vector around the magnetic field.\n\nWe can use a python script with SymPy to verify the symbolic calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define symbols\nt, hbar, gamma, B = sp.symbols('t hbar gamma B', real=True, positive=True)\n\n# Define the Larmor frequency\nw = gamma * B\n\n# The Hamiltonian is H = -gamma * B * Sy.\n# Sy is the spin operator in the y direction, Sy = (hbar/2) * sigma_y\n# The time evolution operator U(t) = exp(-i*H*t/hbar) simplifies to:\n# U(t) = exp(i * (gamma * B * t / 2) * sigma_y)\n# Let theta = gamma*B*t/2\ntheta = w * t / 2\n\n# We use the identity: exp(i*theta*sigma_y) = cos(theta)*I + i*sin(theta)*sigma_y\nI = sp.Matrix([[1, 0], [0, 1]])\nsigma_y = sp.Matrix([[0, -sp.I], [sp.I, 0]])\nU_t = sp.cos(theta) * I + sp.I * sp.sin(theta) * sigma_y\n\n# Initial state |psi(0)> = |+z> corresponds to the vector [1, 0] in the z-basis\npsi_0 = sp.Matrix([1, 0])\n\n# State at time t: |psi(t)> = U(t)|psi(0)>\npsi_t = U_t * psi_0\n\n# The operator for the z-component of spin is Sz = (hbar/2)*sigma_z\nsigma_z = sp.Matrix([[1, 0], [0, -1]])\nSz = (hbar/2) * sigma_z\n\n# Calculate the expectation value <Sz>(t) = <psi(t)|Sz|psi(t)>\n# The bra <psi(t)| is the conjugate transpose of the ket |psi(t)>\nexp_Sz = psi_t.H * Sz * psi_t\n\n# The result is a 1x1 matrix. We extract the element and simplify.\nexp_Sz_val = sp.simplify(exp_Sz[0])\n\n# The expression for <Sz>(t) is of the form A*cos(Omega*t).\n# The oscillation frequency is Omega.\n# We print the expression for <Sz>(t) to identify the frequency.\nprint(exp_Sz_val)\n\n```\n>>>\nhbar*cos(B*gamma*t)/2\n>>> The python code confirms the analytical result: the expectation value `<S_z>(t)` is proportional to `cos(B*gamma*t)`.\nThe oscillation is described by `cos((γB)t)`. The coefficient of `t` inside the cosine function is the angular frequency.\nThus, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants me to find the oscillation frequency of the z-component of a particle's magnetic moment under a changing magnetic field.\n\n**1. Initial Setup (t < 0):**\n*   The particle is spin-1/2.\n*   The magnetic field is `B_initial = B * ẑ` (where `ẑ` is the unit vector in the +Z direction).\n*   The particle's magnetic moment `μ = γS` is aligned with this field. This implies the system is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n*   The initial Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B_initial = - (γS_z) * B`.\n*   The energy eigenstates are the spin-up `|+z>` and spin-down `|-z>` states with energies `E = -γB * m_s * ħ`, where `m_s` is the spin quantum number (`+1/2` or `-1/2`).\n    *   `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   `E_- = +γB(ħ/2)`\n*   For the moment to be \"aligned\" with the field (the lowest energy state), the system must be in the `|+z>` state (assuming `γ > 0`, which is standard for protons, etc. The final result for frequency is independent of this assumption).\n*   So, the initial state of the system at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. In the S_z basis, this is represented by the column vector `[1, 0]^T`.\n\n**2. The New Hamiltonian (t ≥ 0):**\n*   The magnetic field is suddenly changed to `B_new = B * ŷ`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H_new = -μ ⋅ B_new = -γB S_y`.\n*   The spin operator `S_y` in the S_z basis is given by `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix: `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n*   So, `H_new = -γB(ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n**3. Time Evolution:**\n*   The state of the system at time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-i*H_new*t / ħ)` is the time-evolution operator.\n*   `U(t) = exp(-i * [-γB(ħ/2)σ_y] * t / ħ) = exp(i * (γBt/2) * σ_y)`.\n*   We can use the identity `exp(iθ * σ_k) = cos(θ)I + i*sin(θ)σ_k`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n*   Here, the angle `θ = γBt/2`.\n    *   `U(t) = cos(γBt/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i*sin(γBt/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    *   `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`\n*   Now, we find the state vector at time `t`:\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)> = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] * [1, 0]^T`\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]^T`\n\n**4. Calculating the Expectation Value:**\n*   We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment: `<μ_z>(t)`.\n*   `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = γ <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n*   The `S_z` operator is `(ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n*   The bra `<ψ(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ(t)>`, which is `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]`.\n*   `<S_z>(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]^T`\n*   `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)]^T`\n*   `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n*   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n    *   `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n**5. Finding the Oscillation Frequency:**\n*   Now we can find the full expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component:\n    *   `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n*   The expression for the average value oscillates with time according to `cos((γB)t)`.\n*   An oscillation of the form `cos(Ωt)` has an angular frequency `Ω`.\n*   By comparing, the oscillation frequency is `Ω = γB`. This is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe provided python code output confirms this calculation.\n*   **Code Output:** `hbar*cos(B*gamma*t)/2`\n*   This is the expression for `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2)cos((γB)t)`.\n*   The term multiplying time `t` inside the cosine function is `γB`. This is the angular frequency of the oscillation.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
