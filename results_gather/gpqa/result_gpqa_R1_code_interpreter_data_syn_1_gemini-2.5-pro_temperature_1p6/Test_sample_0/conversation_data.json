    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The problem connects the lifetime of quantum states to their energy levels. This is a direct application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the time-energy uncertainty relation.\n\n2.  **State the Time-Energy Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which we can know both the energy of a particle (ΔE) and the time for which it has that energy (Δt). The mathematical relation is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n3.  **Interpret the terms in the context of the problem:**\n    *   **Δt**: This is the lifetime of the quantum state (τ). A state with a finite lifetime cannot have a perfectly defined energy.\n    *   **ΔE**: This is the inherent uncertainty or \"width\" of the energy level, often called the natural linewidth (Γ). This means the energy level isn't a sharp line but is \"smeared out\" over a range of energies of width ΔE.\n    *   **\"Clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\"**: To distinguish two energy levels, E1 and E2, their energy difference, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than their combined energy uncertainty. A common criterion for resolution is that the separation between the peaks must be at least on the order of the sum of their individual widths (FWHMs - Full Width at Half Maximum). The width (Γ) is given by Γ ≈ ħ / τ.\n\n4.  **Calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state:**\n    *   The lifetime of state 1 is τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n    *   The lifetime of state 2 is τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n    *   The value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in electron-volt-seconds is approximately ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n    Now, we calculate the energy width for each state using the relation ΔE ≈ ħ / τ:\n    *   **For state 1:**\n        ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   **For state 2:**\n        ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n    Note that the shorter-lived state (state 1) has a larger energy uncertainty (it is \"broader\").\n\n5.  **Determine the condition for resolution:**\n    To clearly resolve the two states, the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than the widths of the energy levels. At a minimum, the separation should be greater than the width of the broader level (ΔE₁). A more stringent condition is that the separation should be greater than the sum of their widths:\n    Required separation ≈ ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    So, to be clearly resolved, the energy difference must be significantly larger than ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    We are looking for an energy difference that satisfies the condition |E₁ - E₂| > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV (10⁻⁴ = 1000 x 10⁻⁷). The levels would be very clearly resolved.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would completely overlap and be unresolvable.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would heavily overlap and not be resolved.\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is far too small. The levels would be completely indistinguishable.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The only energy difference large enough to allow the two states to be clearly distinguished is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\nLet's verify the calculation with a Python script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\ntau1 = 1e-9  # Lifetime of state 1 in seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # Lifetime of state 2 in seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy width (natural linewidth) for each state\n# Delta_E = h_bar / tau\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\n# To resolve two lines, their separation must be on the order of, or greater than,\n# the sum of their individual widths (FWHM).\nrequired_separation = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Sum of widths (approximate required separation): {required_separation:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-4,\n    \"B\": 1e-9,\n    \"C\": 1e-8,\n    \"D\": 1e-11\n}\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Comparing with options ---\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_separation:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV): Is large enough for resolution.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV): Is NOT large enough for resolution.\")\n```\n<<<\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem involves the time-energy uncertainty principle, which states that the lifetime of a state (Δt or τ) is inversely related to the inherent uncertainty or width of its energy level (ΔE). The relationship is given by:\n\nΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nThis means that a state with a finite lifetime does not have a perfectly sharp energy, but is \"smeared out\" over a range of energies of width ΔE. To be able to \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two different energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths.\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy width for State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy width for State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁ > ΔE₂).\n\n3.  **Determine the condition for resolution:**\n    For the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, the separation between them must be larger than their combined energy spread. A good rule of thumb is that the energy difference should be at least on the order of the sum of the individual widths:\n    *   Required separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    *   Required separation > (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 x 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n4.  **Evaluate the options against the condition:**\n    We need to find the option that is greater than ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV: This value is much larger than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV (since 10⁻⁴ = 1000 x 10⁻⁷). This separation would be sufficient to clearly resolve the two levels.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap completely.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would still be heavily overlapped and not resolved.\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is extremely small and the levels would be indistinguishable.\n\nTherefore, the only energy difference that allows for clear resolution is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
