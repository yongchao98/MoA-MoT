    "Here is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThe problem involves relativistic speeds, so we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula to find the relative speed between the two astronauts. Let's denote the velocities of the two astronauts as $v_1$ and $v_2$ in a stationary reference frame.\n\n*   $v_1$ (astronaut of mass 3m) = 0.5c\n*   $v_2$ (astronaut of mass 2m) = 0.6c\n\nThe formula for the relative velocity ($v_{rel}$) of object 2 with respect to object 1 is:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a particle moving at relativistic speed is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts, as measured from the stationary frame.\n$E_{total} = E_{astro1} + E_{astro2}$\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):**\n*   $m_1 = 2m$\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1$:\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Calculate the energy $E_1$:\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):**\n*   $m_2 = 3m$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2$:\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Calculate the energy $E_2$:\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m)c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy of the system:**\n*   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n*   $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2 \\approx (2.5 + 3.4641) mc^2$\n*   $E_{total} \\approx 5.9641 mc^2$\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\nLet's use a Python script to verify the numerical calculations.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants (we can set c=1, m=1 for simplicity in calculation)\nc = 1\nm = 1\n\n# Astronaut 1 (let's call it A)\nm_a = 2 * m\nv_a = 0.6 * c\n\n# Astronaut 2 (let's call it B)\nm_b = 3 * m\nv_b = 0.5 * c\n\n# --- Part 1: Relative Speed ---\n# Formula: v_rel = (v_a - v_b) / (1 - (v_a * v_b) / c**2)\nv_rel_numerator = v_a - v_b\nv_rel_denominator = 1 - (v_a * v_b) / c**2\nv_rel = v_rel_numerator / v_rel_denominator\n\nprint(f\"Relative speed in units of c: {v_rel:.3f}c\")\n\n\n# --- Part 2: Total Energy ---\n# Formula: E = gamma * m * c**2\n# Gamma: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v**2 / c**2)\n\n# Energy of Astronaut A\ngamma_a = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v_a/c)**2)\nenergy_a = gamma_a * m_a * c**2\n\n# Energy of Astronaut B\ngamma_b = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v_b/c)**2)\nenergy_b = gamma_b * m_b * c**2\n\n# Total Energy\ntotal_energy = energy_a + energy_b\n\nprint(f\"Total energy in units of mc^2: {total_energy:.3f} mc^2\")\n\n```\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed: **0.14c**\n*   Total energy: **5.96mc²**\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc²\nB) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc²\nC) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc²\nD) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc²\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem requires calculating the relative speed and the total energy of a system of two astronauts with different masses and relativistic speeds.\n\n**Part 1: Calculating the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nIn special relativity, velocities do not simply add or subtract. We must use the relativistic velocity addition formula (or in this case, subtraction) to find the relative speed between the two astronauts.\n\nLet's denote the velocity of the first astronaut (mass 2m) as $v_1 = 0.6c$ and the velocity of the second astronaut (mass 3m) as $v_2 = 0.5c$. Both are in the same direction (positive x-direction).\n\nThe formula for the relative velocity of astronaut 1 with respect to astronaut 2 is:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculating the Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a single particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the formula $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the two individual astronauts, as measured from the stationary reference frame.\n\n*   **Energy of the first astronaut (mass $m_1 = 2m$, speed $v_1 = 0.6c$)**\n\nFirst, calculate its Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1$:\n$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n\nNow, calculate its energy, $E_1$:\n$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Energy of the second astronaut (mass $m_2 = 3m$, speed $v_2 = 0.5c$)**\n\nFirst, calculate its Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$:\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n\nNow, calculate its energy, $E_2$:\n$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m)c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Total Energy of the System**\n\nThe total energy is the sum $E = E_1 + E_2$:\n$E_{total} = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.4641) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx 5.9641 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c** and the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
