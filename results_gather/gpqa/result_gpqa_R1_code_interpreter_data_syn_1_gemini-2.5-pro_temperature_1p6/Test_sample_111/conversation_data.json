    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Normalize the State Vector\nThe state `|alpha>` is given as being proportional to `(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`.\nLet `|alpha> = N * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`, where N is the normalization constant.\nFor a quantum state to be physically meaningful, its norm must be 1, meaning `<alpha|alpha> = 1`.\n\nThe bra corresponding to `|alpha>` is `<alpha| = N* * [(1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down|]`. We can choose N to be real.\n\n`<alpha|alpha> = N² * <(1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down| | (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> >`\nUsing the orthonormality of the basis vectors (`<up|up> = 1`, `<down|down> = 1`, `<up|down> = <down|up> = 0`), the inner product simplifies to:\n`1 = N² * [ (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i) ]`\n`1 = N² * [ |1+i|² + |2-i|² ]`\n`1 = N² * [ (1² + 1²) + (2² + (-1)²) ]`\n`1 = N² * [ (1+1) + (4+1) ]`\n`1 = N² * [ 2 + 5 ]`\n`1 = 7N²`\nSo, `N = 1 / sqrt(7)`.\n\nThe normalized state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\nIn the standard basis where `|up> = [1, 0]^T` and `|down> = [0, 1]^T`, the state vector is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n\n### 2. Define the Operator and Find its Eigensystem\nThe operator A is defined by its matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j` and `Aii = 0`. In the `{|up>, |down>}` basis, this gives the matrix:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis is proportional to the Pauli-X matrix, `A = (hbar/2) * σ_x`.\n\nTo find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A, we first need to find these eigenstates and their corresponding eigenvalues. We solve the eigenvalue equation `A|v> = λ|v>`.\n`det(A - λI) = 0`\n`det([[-λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = 0`\n`λ² - (hbar/2)² = 0`\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding eigenvectors:\n*   For `λ₁ = +hbar/2`:\n    `(A - λ₁I)v₁ = 0` gives `[[-hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -hbar/2]] [a, b]^T = 0`.\n    This implies `-a + b = 0`, so `a = b`. The normalized eigenvector is `|v₁> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n*   For `λ₂ = -hbar/2`:\n    `(A - λ₂I)v₂ = 0` gives `[[hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, hbar/2]] [a, b]^T = 0`.\n    This implies `a + b = 0`, so `a = -b`. The normalized eigenvector is `|v₂> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probabilities\nThe probability `P(λ_i)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ_i` is given by the squared magnitude of the projection of `|alpha>` onto the corresponding eigenstate `|v_i>`, i.e., `P(λ_i) = |<v_i|alpha>|²`.\n\n*   **Probability of measuring `λ₁ = +hbar/2`**:\n    `<v₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [<up| + <down|] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n    `<v₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [1 * (1+i) + 1 * (2-i)]`\n    `<v₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [1 + i + 2 - i] = 3 / sqrt(14)`\n    `P(λ₁) = |3 / sqrt(14)|² = 9 / 14 ≈ 0.6429`\n\n*   **Probability of measuring `λ₂ = -hbar/2`**:\n    `<v₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [<up| - <down|] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n    `<v₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [1 * (1+i) - 1 * (2-i)]`\n    `<v₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [1 + i - 2 + i] = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)`\n    `P(λ₂) = |(-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)|² = ((-1)² + 2²) / 14 = (1 + 4) / 14 = 5 / 14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\n(Check: `P(λ₁) + P(λ₂) = 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1`).\nThe probabilities are approximately **0.64** and **0.36**.\n\n### 4. Find the Average Value\nThe average value (or expectation value) of the operator A is given by `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`. An equivalent way to calculate it is using the eigenvalues and probabilities: `<A> = Σ P(λ_i) * λ_i`.\n\nUsing the second method:\n`<A> = P(λ₁) * λ₁ + P(λ₂) * λ₂`\n`<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (9/14 - 5/14)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (4/14)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7)`\n`<A> = hbar / 7`\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is `hbar / 7`. This matches option B.\n\nFinal check with Python to ensure no calculation errors.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# State vector components\nc1 = 1 + 1j\nc2 = 2 - 1j\nalpha_unnormalized = np.array([c1, c2])\n\n# Normalize\nnorm = np.linalg.norm(alpha_unnormalized)\nalpha = alpha_unnormalized / norm\n\n# Operator A\nhbar = 1 # Set hbar=1 for calculation, add back later\nA = (hbar / 2) * np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])\n\n# Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A\neigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(A)\n\n# Eigenvector for +hbar/2 is (1/sqrt(2))*[1, 1]\n# Eigenvector for -hbar/2 is (1/sqrt(2))*[1, -1]\nv1 = (1/np.sqrt(2)) * np.array([1, 1])\nv2 = (1/np.sqrt(2)) * np.array([1, -1])\n\n# Probabilities\nprob1 = np.abs(np.vdot(v1, alpha))**2\nprob2 = np.abs(np.vdot(v2, alpha))**2\n\n# Average value\navg_A = np.vdot(alpha, A @ alpha)\n\nprint(f\"Probability for eigenvalue +hbar/2: {prob1:.2f} (exact: {9/14:.4f})\")\nprint(f\"Probability for eigenvalue -hbar/2: {prob2:.2f} (exact: {5/14:.4f})\")\nprint(f\"Average value is hbar * {avg_A.real:.4f} (exact: hbar * {1/7:.4f})\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
