    "This question asks for the correct reaction sequence to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene in high yield. Let's analyze the structure of the target molecule and work backward (retrosynthesis) to determine a plausible synthetic route.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nThis is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe relationship between substituents is 1,2,3. Specifically, -OEt is ortho to -tBu, -tBu is ortho to -NO2, and -OEt is meta to -NO2. This crowded 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially with a bulky tert-butyl group, requires a carefully planned synthesis.\n\n**Retrosynthetic Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Final Step:** The ethoxy group (-OEt) is most likely introduced at the end by a Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol. This involves treating the phenol with a base (like NaOH) followed by an ethyl halide (like EtBr).\n    *   **Precursor:** 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n    *   **Reaction:** `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`.\n    This corresponds to step `vii) NaOH/EtBr` found in options A, C, and D.\n\n2.  **Introducing the Hydroxyl Group:** A phenol is often made from an aniline via diazotization followed by hydrolysis. The aniline is treated with nitrous acid (`NaNO2/HCl`) to form a diazonium salt, which is then heated in water (`H3O+, H2O/Heat`) to yield the phenol.\n    *   **Precursor:** 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline (or IUPAC name: 3-nitro-2-(tert-butyl)aniline). This means an amino group (-NH2) at position 1, a t-butyl group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3.\n    *   **Reactions:** `(v) NaNO2/HCl` followed by `(vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`. This sequence is present in option D.\n\n3.  **Introducing the Nitro Group (at C3):** How to make 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline? It can be formed by the nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline.\n    *   **Precursor:** 2-tert-butylaniline.\n    *   **Reaction:** Nitration (`iv) HNO3/H2SO4`). Let's analyze the directing effects. In a simple nitration (using a protecting group for the amine), the directing effects would not favor the required isomer. However, nitration of anilines in strong acid (like `HNO3/H2SO4`) proceeds via the anilinium ion (-NH3+). In `2-tert-butylanilinium`, the `-NH3+` group (at C1) is a meta-director, and the `-tBu` group (at C2) is an ortho,para-director.\n        *   `-NH3+` directs to C3 and C5.\n        *   `-tBu` directs to its ortho (C3) and para (C5) positions.\n        *   Both groups direct incoming electrophiles to positions 3 and 5. Although the para position (5) is usually favored due to less steric hindrance, the ortho position (3) is also activated. The formation of the desired 3-nitro isomer is plausible.\n\n4.  **Creating 2-tert-butylaniline:** This aniline can be prepared by the reduction of the corresponding nitro compound.\n    *   **Precursor:** o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene).\n    *   **Reaction:** Reduction using `(iii) Fe/HCl`.\n\n5.  **Creating o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene:** This is a critical step. Direct nitration (`ii) HNO3/H2SO4`) of tert-butylbenzene gives mainly the para isomer due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group. To achieve a high yield of the ortho isomer, a blocking group strategy is necessary.\n    *   **Precursor:** tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   **Strategy:**\n        a.  Sulfonate tert-butylbenzene. The bulky sulfonic acid group (`-SO3H`) will add to the para position, which is sterically most accessible. This blocks the para position. (Requires `SO3/H2SO4`, step `viii`).\n        b.  Nitrate the resulting p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. With the para position blocked, nitration is directed to the ortho position relative to the tert-butyl group. (Requires `HNO3/H2SO4`, step `ii`).\n        c.  Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group. Sulfonation is a reversible reaction, and the `-SO3H` group can be removed by heating with dilute acid. (Requires `dilute H2SO4`, step `ix`).\n    *   This three-step sequence (`viii -> ii -> ix`) provides a high-yield route to o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n\n6.  **Creating tert-butylbenzene:** This is made from benzene via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   **Precursor:** Benzene.\n    *   **Reaction:** `(i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A)** Fails at step (iii), Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline is problematic and low-yield.\n*   **B) & C)** Contain chemically incorrect sequences (e.g., diazotization without an amine, or strange reaction order for a diazonium salt).\n*   **D)** This option contains all the necessary reagents for the plausible high-yield synthesis outlined above. However, the sequence as written is incorrect, with the sulfonation/desulfonation steps (`viii`, `ix`) placed at the very end after the final product is already formed. This is a common type of error in multiple-choice questions. Assuming the question intends to provide the *set* of reagents for a viable synthesis, and the order is scrambled, option D is the only one that provides all the components for a valid, high-yield pathway. The intended sequence should likely be `i -> viii -> ii -> ix -> iii -> iv -> v -> vi -> vii`. Despite the incorrect ordering presented, it is the best possible answer among the choices.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe logical high-yield synthesis requires the specific set of reactions found in option D. The pathway involves creating tert-butylbenzene, using a sulfonation-nitration-desulfonation sequence to install a nitro group ortho to the tert-butyl group, reducing the nitro group to an amine, nitrating the corresponding anilinium ion to install the second nitro group, converting the amine to a phenol via diazotization, and finally performing a Williamson ether synthesis. No other option provides a chemically sound path.\n\n<<<D>>>"
