    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X:\n\n**1. Analyze the Product from the NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's deduce the structure of the product formed in the reaction from the given ¹H-NMR and ¹³C-NMR spectra. The molecular formula of the starting material, Compound X, is C11H12O. Since this is a rearrangement reaction, the product will have the same molecular formula.\n\n*   **¹³C-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   A signal at δ 197.7 ppm is characteristic of a ketone carbonyl carbon (C=O), specifically a conjugated ketone.\n    *   Signals at δ 21.3 and δ 28.4 ppm correspond to two different sp³ carbons, likely methyl groups. Let's call them Me-A and Me-B. The δ 21.3 ppm is typical for a methyl group on an aromatic ring (a tolyl group). The δ 28.4 ppm is consistent with a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (an acetyl group, -COCH₃).\n    *   There are 8 carbons in the alkene/aromatic region (δ 120-150 ppm). The signals at 126.9 (2C) and 129.1 (2C) suggest four equivalent `CH` carbons, and the signals at 127.1 (1C) and 130.3 (1C) suggest two other non-equivalent `CH` carbons. This makes a total of six `CH` groups in the sp² region.\n    *   The signals at δ 141.5 and 144.1 ppm are quaternary sp² carbons.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   Two singlets at δ 2.28 (3H) and δ 2.31 (3H) correspond to two methyl groups that are not adjacent to any protons. This aligns with the `¹³C-NMR` interpretation of an acetyl methyl and a tolyl methyl.\n    *   The signals in the aromatic/alkene region (δ 6.5-8.0 ppm) sum to 6 protons.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H (δ 7.08 and δ 7.71), is a classic signature for a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The remaining two signals at δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d) must be two vinylic protons on a double bond (`-CH=CH-`) coupled to each other. The large difference in their chemical shifts suggests a highly polarized double bond, typical of an α,β-unsaturated system.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    Let's put the pieces together:\n    1.  A ketone group (`-C(=O)-`).\n    2.  A methyl ketone (acetyl group, `-CO-CH₃`). This accounts for the `C=O`, one methyl singlet (e.g., δ 2.28, s, 3H), and the `¹³C` signal at δ 28.4.\n    3.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring with a methyl group (a p-tolyl group). This accounts for the other methyl singlet (e.g., δ 2.31, s, 3H, `¹³C` at 21.3) and the two 2H doublets in the aromatic region.\n    4.  A disubstituted double bond (`-CH=CH-`). This accounts for the two 1H doublets.\n\n    Connecting these fragments, the only logical structure is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**, also known as (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n    Structure: `(p-CH₃-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-CO-CH₃`\n    This structure is consistent with the molecular formula C11H12O and all the NMR data.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Starting Materials**\n\nThe reaction involves heating a compound X (a vinyl epoxide) with DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), a non-nucleophilic base, in a nonpolar solvent. This is characteristic of a base-catalyzed rearrangement of a vinyl epoxide.\n\nThe product contains a p-tolyl group `(p-CH₃-C₆H₄)-`. This group must have been present in the starting material, as the reaction conditions are not suitable for methylation of a phenyl ring. Let's examine the options for Compound X:\n\n*   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** Structure `Ph-CH=C(CH₃)-[oxirane]`. It has a phenyl (Ph) group, not a p-tolyl group. This cannot be Compound X.\n*   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The styryl group is `-CH=CH-Ph`. A 4-methylstyryl group is `-CH=CH-(p-CH₃-C₆H₄)`. Attached to an oxirane ring, the structure is `(p-CH₃-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-CH-O-CH₂`. This compound contains the required p-tolyl group and has the correct molecular formula C11H12O. This is a very strong candidate.\n*   **C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** Structure `Ph-CH=CH-CH-O-CH-CH₃`. It has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. This cannot be Compound X.\n*   **D) 2-styrylepoxide:** A generic name, but a simple styryl epoxide (`Ph-CH=CH-[oxirane]`) would be C10H10O, which is the wrong molecular formula.\n\n**3. Determine the Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe only plausible starting material is **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**. Now we must verify that it can rearrange to the identified product under the given conditions.\n\nThe base-catalyzed vinyl epoxide rearrangement proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Deprotonation:** DABCO abstracts the acidic proton on the epoxide carbon adjacent (alpha) to the vinyl group.\n    `(p-Me-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-C(H)-(oxirane ring) + B  ⇌  (p-Me-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-C(-)-(oxirane ring) + BH⁺`\n2.  **Ring Opening:** The resulting carbanion promotes an elimination-like ring opening of the epoxide to form an enolate anion.\n    `(p-Me-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-C(-)-CH₂-O  →  (p-Me-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-C(=CH₂)-O⁻`\n3.  **Tautomerization:** The enolate is protonated to form an enol, which rapidly tautomerizes to the more stable ketone product.\n    `(p-Me-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-C(=CH₂)-O⁻ + BH⁺ → (p-Me-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-C(OH)=CH₂ + B`\n    `(p-Me-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-C(OH)=CH₂ (enol)  ⇌  (p-Me-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-CO-CH₃ (ketone)`\n\nThis mechanism directly converts starting material B into the product that was deduced from the NMR spectra.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the conservation of the p-tolyl group from reactant to product and a plausible chemical mechanism, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<B>>>"
