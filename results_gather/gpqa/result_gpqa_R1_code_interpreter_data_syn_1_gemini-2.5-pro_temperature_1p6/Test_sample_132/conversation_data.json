    "Here is my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   I need to find the final concentration of orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-.\n    *   The solution contains two salts: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n    *   I am given the masses and molar masses of the salts.\n    *   I am given the acid dissociation constants (Ka values) for phosphoric acid (H3PO4). The species in the solution are related to the second and third dissociations.\n\n2.  **Identify the Chemical Species:**\n    *   KH2PO4 is a salt that dissociates completely in water to give K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate ion).\n    *   Na2HPO4·2H2O is a salt that dissociates completely in water to give 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate ion). The water of hydration just becomes part of the solvent.\n    *   Therefore, the solution is primarily a mixture of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-. This is a classic buffer system. H2PO4- is the weak acid, and HPO4^2- is its conjugate base.\n\n3.  **Plan the Calculation Steps:**\n    *   **Step A:** Calculate the number of moles of each salt added to the solution. This will give me the moles of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-.\n        *   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar Mass\n        *   Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   **Step B:** Calculate the initial molar concentrations of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-.\n        *   Concentration = Moles / Volume (in Liters)\n    *   **Step C:** Determine the relevant equilibria. The two main equilibria involving our species are:\n        *   Equilibrium 1 (Buffer equilibrium): H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻ (governed by Ka2)\n        *   Equilibrium 2 (Formation of PO4³⁻): HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻ (governed by Ka3)\n    *   **Step D:** Use the buffer equilibrium (Equilibrium 1) to calculate the concentration of H⁺ ions in the solution. Since we have a buffer, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is applicable, but it's more direct to use the Ka2 expression:\n        *   Ka2 = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻]\n        *   Rearranging gives: [H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻])\n        *   I will use the initial concentrations calculated in Step B, as the change due to dissociation is negligible for a buffer.\n    *   **Step E:** Use the [H⁺] calculated in Step D and the equilibrium for the formation of orthophosphate (Equilibrium 2) to find [PO4³⁻].\n        *   Ka3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n        *   Rearranging to solve for the unknown: [PO4³⁻] = Ka3 * ([HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺])\n        *   Again, I'll use the initial concentration of HPO4²⁻ as its consumption to form PO4³⁻ is very small (since Ka3 is very small, 1.8x10⁻¹²).\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation Plan:**\n    *   I will use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately and avoid rounding errors in intermediate steps.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step A: Define constants and calculate moles\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.200  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Moles of H2PO4- from KH2PO4\nmoles_H2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\n\n# Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4.2H2O\nmoles_HPO4 = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Step B: Calculate initial concentrations\nconc_H2PO4 = moles_H2PO4 / volume_L\nconc_HPO4 = moles_HPO4 / volume_L\n\n# Step D: Calculate [H+] using the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\n# We use the calculated initial concentrations as they are good approximations for a buffer.\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4 / conc_HPO4)\n\n# Step E: Calculate [PO4^3-] using the third dissociation equilibrium (Ka3)\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n# We use the initial concentration of HPO4^2- and the calculated [H+].\nconc_PO4_3_minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4 / H_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3_minus:.3e}\")\n```\n executing code...\n\n```output\n6.236e-07\n```\n5.  **Finalize the Answer:**\n    *   The Python code output is `6.236e-07`.\n    *   This can be written as 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n    *   Comparing this result to the given options:\n        *   A) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n        *   B) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n        *   C) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n        *   D) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n    *   The calculated value (6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M) is extremely close to option B (6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M). The small difference is due to rounding in the option itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires a multi-step calculation to determine the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻). Here's a breakdown of the reasoning and calculations:\n\n### **1. Identify the Species and Initial Concentrations**\n\n*   The solution is made by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O) in water.\n*   These salts dissociate completely in water:\n    *   KH₂PO₄ → K⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O → 2 Na⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ + 2 H₂O\n*   The primary species of interest are H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate) and HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate), which form a buffer system.\n\nFirst, we calculate the moles of each salt, which corresponds to the moles of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.\n\n*   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ from KH₂PO₄:\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\nNext, we calculate their initial concentrations in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution.\n\n*   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n### **2. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]**\n\nThe solution is a buffer governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄), described by Ka₂.\n\n*   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   Equilibrium constant expression: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]. For a buffer solution, the initial concentrations are a very good approximation of the equilibrium concentrations.\n\n*   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n*   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n*   [H⁺] ≈ 8.10 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n### **3. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]**\n\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻, which is governed by Ka₃.\n\n*   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   Equilibrium constant expression: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe rearrange this expression to solve for our target ion, [PO₄³⁻].\n\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / (8.10 x 10⁻⁸ M))\n*   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nTo ensure precision, let's perform the entire calculation using a single script.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.200  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles of each species\nmoles_H2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4 = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations of the buffer components\nconc_H2PO4 = moles_H2PO4 / volume_L\nconc_HPO4 = moles_HPO4 / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration using the Ka2 equilibrium\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4 / conc_HPO4)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate concentration using the Ka3 equilibrium\nconc_PO4_3_minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4 / H_plus_conc)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3_minus:.3e}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The code executed successfully, producing a result of `6.236e-07`.\n\n### Reasoning Confirmation\n\n1.  **Initial Species and Concentrations:** The initial calculations correctly determined the molar concentrations of the buffer components: [H₂PO₄⁻] and [HPO₄²⁻].\n2.  **Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:** The buffer system H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ sets the hydrogen ion concentration in the solution, governed by the Ka₂ value. The calculation `[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])` is the correct approach.\n3.  **Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:** The concentration of PO₄³⁻ is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium, which is dependent on the [H⁺] established by the buffer. The calculation `[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])` correctly uses the previously calculated values to find the final answer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M. Comparing this to the provided options:\n\n*   A) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n*   B) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n*   C) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n*   D) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe result 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M rounds to **6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M**. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
