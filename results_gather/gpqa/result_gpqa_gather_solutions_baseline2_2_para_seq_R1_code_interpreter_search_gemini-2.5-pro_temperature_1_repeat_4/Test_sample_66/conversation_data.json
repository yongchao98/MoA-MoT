The initial state is given in the coupled basis: $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This state is an eigenstate of the total z-component of the angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. This means the quantum number for the total z-component of angular momentum, $m$, is exactly -1.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement Outcome (Final State):** A measurement is performed on the individual z-components of the angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of obtaining the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for both. This corresponds to a final state where the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ for the first electron and $m_2 = -1$ for the second electron.\n\n3.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system.\n    *   For the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We see a conflict. The initial state has a total z-component quantum number of $m=-1$, while the desired final state would have a total z-component quantum number of $m_1 + m_2 = -2$. Since $-1 \\neq -2$, this violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. A state with a total $m$ cannot be composed of components whose $m_i$ values do not sum to the total $m$.\n\n    Formally, the probability is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient connecting the initial and final states, $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. Because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied, this Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n\n    Therefore, the probability of observing this outcome is 0.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, taking into account the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:** The system consists of two electrons whose angular momenta are coupled. The state is given in the coupled basis as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   This state is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operator, $L^2$, with quantum number $l=2$.\n    *   Crucially, it is also an eigenstate of the operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum, $L_z$. The corresponding quantum number is $m=-1$, meaning a measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum on this state will always yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Final State:** The measurement is performed on the individual z-components of the angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We are asked for the probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state is described in the uncoupled basis as $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** This is the key physical principle needed to solve the problem. The total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. As operators, this is expressed as $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired final state is consistent with the initial state according to this conservation rule.\n    *   The total magnetic quantum number of the **initial state** is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired **final state**, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We see a conflict: the initial state has a total z-component quantum number of $m=-1$, while the desired measured state has a total z-component quantum number of $m_{total} = -2$.\n    Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the conservation law is violated. This means that the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is orthogonal to the final state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$. In terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, the projection of the initial state onto the final state, $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, is zero because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met.\n\nThe probability of observing an outcome that is physically impossible due to the violation of a conservation law is zero.\n\nAll provided candidate answers correctly arrive at this conclusion in their reasoning, although some select the wrong final letter. The physics is unambiguous.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial Quantum State**\n*   The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n*   The system is described in the *coupled basis*, where the total angular momentum is specified. The state is $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n*   From this, we know the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n*   Crucially, the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum is $m = -1$. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n**2. Understand the Measurement and the Desired Outcome**\n*   A measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n*   The desired outcome is that the eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$ AND the eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$.\n*   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for an $L_z$ component corresponds to a magnetic quantum number of $-1$.\n*   So, the desired final state is one where the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\n**3. Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum (The Selection Rule)**\n*   A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual parts.\n*   This means the operator relationship is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n*   Consequently, for any possible outcome of the measurement, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1$ and $m_2$) must equal the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the initial state.\n*   The selection rule is: **$m = m_1 + m_2$**.\n\n**4. Check if the Desired Outcome is Possible**\n*   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n*   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n*   Let's check the sum for this outcome: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n**5. Compare and Conclude**\n*   The initial state requires the sum of the measured z-components to be $m=-1$.\n*   The desired outcome has a sum of z-components equal to $-2$.\n*   Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the desired outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n*   An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible.\n*   Therefore, the probability of observing this outcome is 0.\n\nThis reasoning is consistently presented in the logic of all candidate answers. The discrepancies in the final letter choices in some candidates appear to be transcription errors, as their own reasoning points directly to zero. The correct answer is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **System:** We have a system of two electrons.\n*   **Individual States:** Each electron is in a 'p orbital', which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$.\n*   **System State:** The two electrons are in a combined, or *coupled*, angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   This notation tells us the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system is $l=2$.\n    *   Critically, the quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator, and any measurement of this total quantity will always yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n*   **The Measurement:** A joint measurement is performed on the z-components of the *individual* angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n*   **The Question:** We need to find the probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the individual quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the individual quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n**2. Core Physical Principle**\n\nThe central concept required to solve this problem is the addition of angular momenta. A fundamental law in this context is that the operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum is the simple sum of the operators for the individual z-components:\n$L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\nThis relationship between the operators implies a strict conservation rule for their corresponding quantum numbers when a measurement is performed:\n$m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\nThis means that for a system in a state with a total z-component quantum number $m$, any possible measurement outcome for the individual components ($m_{l1}$, $m_{l2}$) must sum to $m$.\n\n**3. Applying the Principle to the Problem**\n\nLet's check if the desired outcome is physically possible given the initial state.\n\n*   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the system has a definite total magnetic quantum number, **$m = -1$**.\n*   From the desired measurement outcome, we have the individual magnetic quantum numbers **$m_{l1} = -1$** and **$m_{l2} = -1$**.\n*   Let's find the sum for this specific outcome: $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nNow, we compare the total quantum number of the initial state with the sum for the desired final state:\n*   Initial State's Total m: **-1**\n*   Final State's Total m: **-2**\n\nSince $-1 \\neq -2$, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n**4. Conclusion on Probability**\n\nIn quantum mechanics, if a potential measurement outcome violates a fundamental conservation law dictated by the initial state, that outcome is impossible. The probability of an impossible event is 0.\n\nFormally, the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ and the state corresponding to the measurement outcome $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$ are both eigenstates of the total $L_z$ operator, but with different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$, respectively). Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator with different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of transitioning from one to the other upon measurement is the square of their inner product, which is zero.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers:\n\n**1. Understand the System's Initial State**\nThe system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$.\nThe system is in a *coupled* state, represented by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n*   $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n*   $m=-1$ is the total magnetic quantum number. This number represents the eigenvalue of the z-component of the *total* angular momentum operator, $L_z$. So, a measurement of $L_z$ on this state will always yield the value $-1\\hbar$.\n\n**2. Understand the Measurement and Desired Final State**\nA joint measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of the angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\nThe question asks for the probability of obtaining the following results:\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to a final state for electron 1 with magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to a final state for electron 2 with magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\nThis desired outcome corresponds to the system being found in the *uncoupled* state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n**3. Apply the Fundamental Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum**\nThis is the crucial step and is correctly identified in the reasoning of all candidate answers. The total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual z-components, $L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship between the operators imposes a strict selection rule on their corresponding quantum numbers:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\nThis rule means that a coupled state with total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only be composed of uncoupled states for which the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) is equal to $m$. Any transition or measurement where this condition is not met is impossible.\n\n**4. Check if the Measurement Outcome is Possible**\n*   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n*   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n*   Let's check the sum for the desired outcome: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nNow, we compare the total $m$ of the initial state with the required sum from the final state:\n$-1 \\neq -2$\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated. The measurement outcome is inconsistent with the initial state of the system because it violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An initial state with a total $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$ cannot be measured to have a final state with a total $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-2\\hbar$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of this measurement outcome is exactly **0**.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 1/2\nD) 2/3\n\nThe correct option is B. While most of the candidate answers arrive at the correct reasoning (that the probability is 0), only answers 1, 12, and 14 correctly map this to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State**: The system of two electrons is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   This state is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum squared operator, $L^2$, and the z-component of the total angular momentum operator, $L_z$.\n    *   The crucial piece of information is that the quantum number for the z-component of the total angular momentum is $m = -1$. This means that if we measure the total $L_z$, the result is guaranteed to be the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement**: A measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, which are represented by the operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n\n3.  **Understand the Desired Outcome**: We want to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ to be $-\\hbar$ AND the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum**: In quantum mechanics, the operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a fundamental selection rule for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n    This rule states that the coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ is a superposition of uncoupled states $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle$ *only if* the individual magnetic quantum numbers sum to the total magnetic quantum number. If this condition is not met, the uncoupled state is not a part of the superposition, and the probability of measuring it is zero.\n\n5.  **Check if the Condition is Met**:\n    *   For the initial state, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, we have $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the sum: $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   We compare the sum of the desired individual quantum numbers with the total quantum number of the initial state: $-2 \\neq -1$.\n    *   Since the condition $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is violated, the desired outcome is physically impossible. A system known to have a total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$ cannot be measured to have a total of $-2\\hbar$.\n    *   The probability of a physically impossible event is 0.\n\nAlmost all candidate answers present this correct line of reasoning. The discrepancy lies in their final choice of letter. The correct physical reasoning unanimously points to a probability of 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State**: The system is in the coupled state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The key piece of information here is that the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$. This means the system is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Measurement Outcome**: We are asked for the probability of a specific measurement outcome.\n    *   The measurement of $L_{1z}$ yields the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. This means the individual magnetic quantum number for the first electron is found to be $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The measurement of $L_{2z}$ yields the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. This means the individual magnetic quantum number for the second electron is found to be $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum**: A fundamental principle of angular momentum addition is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This gives a strict selection rule for the quantum numbers: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: Let's see if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state according to the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The required sum of the outcome quantum numbers ($-2$) does not match the system's definite total quantum number ($-1$). Since the z-component of angular momentum must be conserved, it is physically impossible for a system with a total $m=-1$ to be measured in a state where the components sum to $-2$.\n\n6.  **Probability**: The probability of a physically impossible event is 0. This is also seen more formally using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which give the projection of the initial state onto the final state. The coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is non-zero only if $m=m_1+m_2$. In this case, since the condition is not met, the coefficient is zero, and its square (the probability) is also zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 0. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers:\n\n**1. Identification of the Core Physical Principle**\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the central concept: the addition of angular momentum in quantum mechanics. Specifically, they focus on the relationship between the total z-component of angular momentum and the individual z-components of the constituent particles.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Initial State**\nThe system is given to be in the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n*   $l_1 = 1, l_2 = 1$: Each electron is in a p-orbital.\n*   $l = 2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n*   $m = -1$: The magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum.\nThis means the system is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. Any measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum *must* yield this value.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Desired Measurement Outcome**\nThe question asks for the joint probability of measuring:\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ to be $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to a magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to a magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\nIf this outcome were to occur, the total z-component of angular momentum for the measured state would have a quantum number of $m_{total} = m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n**4. Application of the Conservation Law (Selection Rule)**\nA fundamental law of angular momentum addition is that the z-component is conserved. The quantum numbers must follow the selection rule:\n$m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n*   The initial state requires the sum of z-components to be $m = -1$.\n*   The desired measurement outcome would result in a sum of z-components of $m_{total} = -2$.\n\nSince $-1 \\neq -2$, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n**5. Conclusion on Probability**\nAn event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible. The probability of an impossible event is 0.\n\n*   This is formally expressed using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which describe the projection of the coupled state onto the uncoupled states. The coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle$ is non-zero only if $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$. In this case, since $-1 \\neq -1 + (-1)$, the coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero, and its square (the probability) is also zero.\n*   Alternatively, the initial state $|2, -1\\rangle$ and the final state corresponding to the measurement $|-1, -1\\rangle$ are eigenstates of the same operator $L_z$ but with different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$ respectively). Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal, meaning their inner product is zero. The probability, being the square of this inner product, is zero.\n\n**Final Decision**\nAll provided reasoning from the candidate answers, when correctly analyzed, leads to the same conclusion: the probability is 0. The correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **System:** We have a system of two electrons.\n*   **Individual States:** Each electron is in a p-orbital, which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$.\n*   **Initial System State:** The system as a whole is in a *coupled* angular momentum state, given by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This state has a definite total angular momentum quantum number ($l=2$) and a definite quantum number for the z-component of the total angular momentum ($m=-1$). This means the total z-component of angular momentum for the system is exactly $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n*   **The Measurement:** A joint measurement of the z-components of the *individual* angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n*   **The Desired Outcome:** We want to find the probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The measurement of $L_{1z}$ yields the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The measurement of $L_{2z}$ yields the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\n**2. Identify the Core Physical Principle**\n\nThe central principle governing this problem is the addition of angular momenta, specifically the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n*   The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n*   This relationship between operators leads to a strict selection rule for their corresponding quantum numbers: for any state that can be physically realized, the total magnetic quantum number must be the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers.\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n**3. Apply the Principle to the Problem**\n\n*   **From the initial state,** we know the system has a well-defined total magnetic quantum number: $m = -1$.\n*   **For the desired measurement outcome,** we have individual magnetic quantum numbers: $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n*   **Let's check if this outcome is consistent with the initial state.** We calculate the sum of the individual quantum numbers for the desired outcome:\n    Sum = $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n*   **Compare the values.** The initial state has a total z-component quantum number of $m=-1$, while the desired outcome state corresponds to a total z-component of -2. Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the conservation rule is violated.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe desired measurement outcome corresponds to a state that is physically impossible to obtain from the given initial state because it would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. In the language of quantum mechanics, the initial state is an eigenstate of the $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$, and the desired final state is an eigenstate of the same operator with eigenvalue $-2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. Therefore, the inner product (projection) between these states is zero. The probability, which is the square of this inner product, is consequently zero.\n\nAlmost every candidate agent correctly identifies this reasoning. The discrepancies lie only in their final letter choice. Based on the universally agreed-upon physical reasoning, the probability is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n**Analysis of the Problem and Candidate Answers**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle:** The problem deals with the addition of angular momenta in quantum mechanics. The most crucial principle to apply here is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n    *   The total z-component of angular momentum, represented by the operator $L_z$, is the sum of the individual components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   This operator relationship leads to a simple algebraic relationship between their corresponding magnetic quantum numbers: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   This relationship acts as a **selection rule**: a coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ can only be composed of uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ where the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) equals the total magnetic quantum number ($m$). A measurement of the individual components on the coupled state will only ever yield results ($m_1, m_2$) that satisfy this sum rule.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State:**\n    *   The system is in the coupled state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   The total magnetic quantum number for the system is given as $m = -1$. This means the system has a definite z-component of total angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Desired Measurement Outcome:**\n    *   The question asks for the probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ to be $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   This corresponds to finding the individual magnetic quantum numbers to be $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Selection Rule:**\n    *   For the desired outcome, let's calculate the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Now, we compare this sum to the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state: Is $m_1 + m_2 = m$?\n    *   Is $-2 = -1$? No, it is not.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The initial state and the final state are eigenstates of the total $L_z$ operator but with different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$ respectively), making them orthogonal.\n    *   The inner product between the initial state and the state corresponding to the desired measurement outcome is zero. This inner product is known as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$, which is zero due to the selection rule violation.\n    *   The probability of an event is the square of the magnitude of its quantum mechanical amplitude. Since the amplitude (the inner product) is 0, the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\n6.  **Evaluation of Candidate Answers:**\n    All 15 candidate answers present a correct line of reasoning, reaching the conclusion that the probability is 0. However, many of them incorrectly select the final answer letter. Answers 3, 10, and 13 correctly state the reasoning and choose the corresponding answer 'A'. The logic across all provided solutions is sound and consistent.\n\nBased on this analysis, the probability is unequivocally zero.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem explores a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics: the addition of angular momentum. We are given the initial state of a two-electron system and asked for the probability of a specific measurement outcome for the individual electrons.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State:**\n    The system is in the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   This state is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operator, $L^2$, with quantum number $l=2$.\n    *   Crucially, it is also an eigenstate of the operator for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum, $L_z$, with quantum number $m=-1$. This means that if you were to measure the total z-component of angular momentum, you would always get the value $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Desired Measurement Outcome:**\n    The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-component of angular momentum for each electron and finding:\n    *   For electron 1, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to a magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   For electron 2, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to a magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state is an uncoupled state, described by $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    The z-component of the total angular momentum is simply the sum of the individual z-components. The operator relationship is:\n    $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n    This implies a strict conservation rule for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    *   From the initial state, we know the system has a total magnetic quantum number of $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   We compare the initial state's total quantum number ($m = -1$) with the required sum from the final state ($m_1 + m_2 = -2$).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. It is physically impossible to start in a state with a total z-component quantum number of $m=-1$ and end up in a configuration where the sum of the parts is $m_1+m_2 = -2$.\n    Therefore, the projection of the initial state onto the final state is zero. The probability, which is the square of this projection (the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $|\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$), is exactly zero.\n\nBased on this clear and universally agreed-upon reasoning present in all the candidate analyses, the probability is 0.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n**Step-by-step analysis of the problem:**\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state of the system:** The system consists of two electrons whose angular momenta are coupled. The state is given in the coupled basis as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ (since they are in p-orbitals).\n    *   The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n    *   The magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum's z-component is $m=-1$. This is a crucial piece of information. It means the system is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the final state corresponding to the measurement:** The question asks for the joint probability of a specific measurement outcome.\n    *   Measurement of the first electron's z-component of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$, yields $-\\hbar$. This means its magnetic quantum number is $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   Measurement of the second electron's z-component of angular momentum, $L_{2z}$, yields $-\\hbar$. This means its magnetic quantum number is $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   This measurement corresponds to projecting the initial state onto the uncoupled basis state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the principle of conservation of angular momentum:** The operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. A direct consequence of this is that their corresponding quantum numbers must also sum:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    This is a strict selection rule. Any combination of individual measurement outcomes ($m_1, m_2$) that does not sum to the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the initial state is a physically impossible outcome.\n\n4.  **Check if the desired outcome is physically possible:**\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired measurement outcome, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check their sum: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The sum of the measured components ($m_1+m_2 = -2$) is not equal to the total magnetic quantum number of the system's initial state ($m=-1$). This violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. Therefore, the probability of this specific measurement outcome is zero.\n\n**Analysis of the Candidate Answers:**\nAll 15 candidate answers provide a correct and consistent line of reasoning based on the conservation of angular momentum (or the equivalent formalisms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and orthogonality of eigenstates). They all conclude that the probability is 0. However, some of them incorrectly map this result to the final multiple-choice letter. The correct mapping is that a probability of 0 corresponds to option D.\n\nThe correct final answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system consists of two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The crucial piece of information here is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This means the system is an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum operator, $L_z$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement Outcome:** A measurement is made of the individual z-components of angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of obtaining an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for both. This corresponds to the measurement projecting the system onto a state where the individual magnetic quantum numbers are **$m_1 = -1$** and **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Principle of Angular Momentum Addition:** The z-component of the total angular momentum is the simple sum of the individual z-components. The operator relationship is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict conservation rule for their corresponding quantum numbers: **$m = m_1 + m_2$**. This rule is also known as the selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system according to this rule.\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number: $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Draw the Conclusion:** The total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) does not equal the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers for the desired outcome ($-2$).\n    *   $-1 \\neq -2$\n    *   This violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. Therefore, the measurement outcome is physically impossible for the given initial state.\n\n6.  **Determine the Probability:** The probability of an impossible event is exactly 0.\n\nAlmost all the candidate answers present this correct line of reasoning, even though some of them arrive at an incorrect final letter. The physics is unambiguous.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State:** The system consists of two electrons whose angular momentum is described in the coupled basis. The initial state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   This tells us the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$.\n    *   It also tells us the total orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the system are $l=2$ and $m=-1$.\n    *   The crucial piece of information is $m=-1$. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum operator, $L_z$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Measurement Outcome:** The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   A measurement of the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to finding the first electron in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   A measurement of the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to finding the second electron in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   So, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** In quantum mechanics, the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. The operator relationship is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This implies a strict selection rule for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\n4.  **Check the Condition:** Let's see if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system.\n    *   The initial state has a total magnetic quantum number of $m = -1$.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome corresponds to individual magnetic quantum numbers of $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   The sum of these individual quantum numbers is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We must have the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state equal to the sum of the individual quantum numbers of the final state. However, we find that $-1 \\neq -2$.\n\n    This means the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. It is physically impossible to start with a system having a total $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$ and find it in a state with a total $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-2\\hbar$.

The core of the problem lies in the rules for adding angular momentum in quantum mechanics. Let's break down the unanimous reasoning.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:** The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   This state is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operator $L^2$ and the total z-component operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   The crucial piece of information is the total magnetic quantum number, $m = -1$. This means that if we measure the total z-component of angular momentum, the result is *always* $-1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome where:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which means the first electron is found with magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which means the second electron is found with magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental law in the coupling of angular momentum is that the z-component is conserved. The total z-component quantum number ($m$) must be equal to the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers ($m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$) that make up the state.\n    *   **Selection Rule:** $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\n4.  **Check if the Desired Outcome is Possible:** We apply the selection rule to the problem:\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual quantum numbers would be $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We find a contradiction: the initial state has a total $m = -1$, but the desired outcome requires the total to be $m = -2$. Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. Such an outcome is physically impossible.\n\n**The Probability:**\nThe probability of a physically impossible event is 0. This can be stated more formally: the probability of the measurement is given by the square of the relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. Because the selection rule $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is violated, this coefficient is exactly zero. Therefore, the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\n**Final decision:** The overwhelming majority of the candidate solutions present flawless reasoning that leads to the conclusion that the probability is 0. Several agents made an error in transcribing this result into the final letter choice. Based on the correct physical principles, the answer must be 0.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate solutions.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n*   **System:** A two-electron system.\n*   **Initial State:** The system is in a specific *coupled* angular momentum state, denoted as `|l₁, l₂, l, m⟩ = |1, 1, 2, -1⟩`. The important information from this notation is:\n    *   `l₁ = 1` and `l₂ = 1`: The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons.\n    *   `l = 2`: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the combined system.\n    *   `m = -1`: The magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum.\n*   **Measurement:** A joint measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of the angular momenta, `L₁z` and `L₂z`.\n*   **Desired Outcome:** We need to find the probability of getting an eigenvalue of `-ħ` for **both** `L₁z` and `L₂z`. An eigenvalue of `-ħ` corresponds to a magnetic quantum number of `-1`. Therefore, the desired final state has individual quantum numbers `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\n**2. Identification of the Core Physical Principle**\nAll candidate answers correctly identify that the solution relies on the principle of addition of angular momentum in quantum mechanics. The central tenet for this problem is the **conservation of the z-component of angular momentum**.\n\n*   The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum (`L_z`) is the simple sum of the individual operators: `L_z = L₁z + L₂z`.\n*   This relationship between the operators imposes a strict **selection rule** on their corresponding quantum numbers: `m = m₁ + m₂`.\n*   This rule means that a coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number `m` can only be formed from, or be measured to be in, uncoupled states where the sum `m₁ + m₂` equals `m`.\n\n**3. Application of the Principle and Key Analysis Points**\nLet's apply the selection rule, which is the most critical step:\n\n*   **Point 1: Identify the definite total 'm' from the initial state.** The initial state `|1, 1, 2, -1⟩` is an eigenstate of the total `L_z` operator. This means it has a definite, non-probabilistic total magnetic quantum number `m = -1`.\n*   **Point 2: Identify the total 'm' required for the final state.** The desired measurement outcome is `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`. The sum of these individual components is `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n*   **Point 3: Compare the initial and final total 'm'.** The initial state requires the sum of z-components to be `-1`, but the desired outcome has a sum of `-2`.\n*   **Point 4: Draw a conclusion based on the comparison.** Since `-1 ≠ -2`, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n**4. Determining the Probability**\nAn event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible. In quantum mechanics, the probability of a physically impossible event is exactly **0**.\n\nFormally, the probability is the squared magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `⟨l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂ | l, m⟩`. This coefficient is non-zero only if `m = m₁ + m₂`. Since this condition is violated, the coefficient `⟨1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1⟩` is zero, and thus the probability is also zero.\n\nAll provided candidate answers reach this same conclusion through their reasoning, even though several fail to map this correct result to the corresponding multiple-choice letter.

The initial state is given in the coupled basis: $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This state is an eigenstate of the total z-component of the angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. This means the quantum number for the total z-component of angular momentum, $m$, is exactly -1.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement Outcome (Final State):** A measurement is performed on the individual z-components of the angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of obtaining the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for both. This corresponds to a final state where the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ for the first electron and $m_2 = -1$ for the second electron.\n\n3.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system.\n    *   For the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We see a conflict. The initial state has a total z-component quantum number of $m=-1$, while the desired final state would have a total z-component quantum number of $m_1 + m_2 = -2$. Since $-1 \\neq -2$, this violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.

Understand the Initial Quantum State**\n*   The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n*   The system is described in the *coupled basis*, where the total angular momentum is specified. The state is $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n*   From this, we know the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n*   Crucially, the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum is $m = -1$. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n**2. Understand the Measurement and the Desired Outcome**\n*   A measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n*   The desired outcome is that the eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$ AND the eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$.\n*   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for an $L_z$ component corresponds to a magnetic quantum number of $-1$.\n*   So, the desired final state is one where the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\n**3. Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum (The Selection Rule)**\n*   A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual parts.\n*   This means the operator relationship is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n*   Consequently, for any possible outcome of the measurement, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1$ and $m_2$) must equal the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the initial state.\n*   The selection rule is: **$m = m_1 + m_2$**.\n\n**4. Check if the Desired Outcome is Possible**\n*   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n*   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n*   Let's check the sum for this outcome: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n**5. Compare and Conclude**\n*   The initial state requires the sum of the measured z-components to be $m=-1$.\n*   The desired outcome has a sum of z-components equal to $-2$.\n*   Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the desired outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n*   An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible.\n*   Therefore, the probability of observing this outcome is 0.\n\nThis reasoning is consistently presented in the logic of all candidate answers. The discrepancies in the final letter choices in some candidates appear to be transcription errors, as their own reasoning points directly to zero. The correct answer is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **System:** We have a system of two electrons.\n*   **Individual States:** Each electron is in a 'p orbital', which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$.\n*   **System State:** The two electrons are in a combined, or *coupled*, angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   This notation tells us the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system is $l=2$.\n    *   Critically, the quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator, and any measurement of this total quantity will always yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n*   **The Measurement:** A joint measurement is performed on the z-components of the *individual* angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n*   **The Question:** We need to find the probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the individual quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the individual quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n**2. Core Physical Principle**\n\nThe central concept required to solve this problem is the addition of angular momenta. A fundamental law in this context is that the operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum is the simple sum of the operators for the individual z-components:\n$L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\nThis relationship between the operators implies a strict conservation rule for their corresponding quantum numbers when a measurement is performed:\n$m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\nThis means that for a system in a state with a total z-component quantum number $m$, any possible measurement outcome for the individual components ($m_{l1}$, $m_{l2}$) must sum to $m$.\n\n**3. Applying the Principle to the Problem**\n\nLet's check if the desired outcome is physically possible given the initial state.\n\n*   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the system has a definite total magnetic quantum number, **$m = -1$**.\n*   From the desired measurement outcome, we have the individual magnetic quantum numbers **$m_{l1} = -1$** and **$m_{l2} = -1$**.\n*   Let's find the sum for this specific outcome: $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nNow, we compare the total quantum number of the initial state with the sum for the desired final state:\n*   Initial State's Total m: **-1**\n*   Final State's Total m: **-2**\n\nSince $-1 \\neq -2$, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n**4. Conclusion on Probability**\n\nIn quantum mechanics, if a potential measurement outcome violates a fundamental conservation law dictated by the initial state, that outcome is impossible. The probability of an impossible event is 0.\n\nFormally, the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ and the state corresponding to the measurement outcome $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$ are both eigenstates of the total $L_z$ operator, but with different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$, respectively). Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator with different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of transitioning from one to the other upon measurement is the square of their inner product, which is zero.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers:\n\n**1. Understand the System's Initial State**\nThe system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$.\nThe system is in a *coupled* state, represented by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n*   $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n*   $m=-1$ is the total magnetic quantum number. This number represents the eigenvalue of the z-component of the *total* angular momentum operator, $L_z$. So, a measurement of $L_z$ on this state will always yield the value $-1\\hbar$.\n\n**2. Understand the Measurement and Desired Final State**\nA joint measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of the angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\nThe question asks for the probability of obtaining the following results:\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to a final state for electron 1 with magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to a final state for electron 2 with magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\nThis desired outcome corresponds to the system being found in the *uncoupled* state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n**3. Apply the Fundamental Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum**\nThis is the crucial step and is correctly identified in the reasoning of all candidate answers. The total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual z-components, $L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship between the operators imposes a strict selection rule on their corresponding quantum numbers:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\nThis rule means that a coupled state with total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only be composed of uncoupled states for which the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) is equal to $m$. Any transition or measurement where this condition is not met is impossible.\n\n**4. Check if the Measurement Outcome is Possible**\n*   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n*   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n*   Let's check the sum for the desired outcome: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nNow, we compare the total $m$ of the initial state with the required sum from the final state:\n$-1 \\neq -2$\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated. The measurement outcome is inconsistent with the initial state of the system because it violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An initial state with a total $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$ cannot be measured to have a final state with a total $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-2\\hbar$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of this measurement outcome is exactly **0**.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 1/2\nD) 2/3\n\nThe correct option is B.

This means that if we measure the total $L_z$, the result is guaranteed to be the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement**: A measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, which are represented by the operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n\n3.  **Understand the Desired Outcome**: We want to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ to be $-\\hbar$ AND the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum**: In quantum mechanics, the operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a fundamental selection rule for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n    This rule states that the coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ is a superposition of uncoupled states $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle$ *only if* the individual magnetic quantum numbers sum to the total magnetic quantum number. If this condition is not met, the uncoupled state is not a part of the superposition, and the probability of measuring it is zero.\n\n5.  **Check if the Condition is Met**:\n    *   For the initial state, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, we have $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the sum: $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   We compare the sum of the desired individual quantum numbers with the total quantum number of the initial state: $-2 \\neq -1$.\n    *   Since the condition $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is violated, the desired outcome is physically impossible. A system known to have a total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$ cannot be measured to have a total of $-2\\hbar$.\n    *   The probability of a physically impossible event is 0.\n\nAlmost all candidate answers present this correct line of reasoning. The discrepancy lies in their final choice of letter. The correct physical reasoning unanimously points to a probability of 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State**: The system is in the coupled state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The key piece of information here is that the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$. This means the system is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Measurement Outcome**: We are asked for the probability of a specific measurement outcome.\n    *   The measurement of $L_{1z}$ yields the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. This means the individual magnetic quantum number for the first electron is found to be $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The measurement of $L_{2z}$ yields the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. This means the individual magnetic quantum number for the second electron is found to be $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum**: A fundamental principle of angular momentum addition is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This gives a strict selection rule for the quantum numbers: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: Let's see if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state according to the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The required sum of the outcome quantum numbers ($-2$) does not match the system's definite total quantum number ($-1$). Since the z-component of angular momentum must be conserved, it is physically impossible for a system with a total $m=-1$ to be measured in a state where the components sum to $-2$.\n\n6.  **Probability**: The probability of a physically impossible event is 0. This is also seen more formally using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which give the projection of the initial state onto the final state. The coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is non-zero only if $m=m_1+m_2$. In this case, since the condition is not met, the coefficient is zero, and its square (the probability) is also zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 0.

Any measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum *must* yield this value.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Desired Measurement Outcome**\nThe question asks for the joint probability of measuring:\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ to be $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to a magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to a magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\nIf this outcome were to occur, the total z-component of angular momentum for the measured state would have a quantum number of $m_{total} = m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n**4. Application of the Conservation Law (Selection Rule)**\nA fundamental law of angular momentum addition is that the z-component is conserved. The quantum numbers must follow the selection rule:\n$m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n*   The initial state requires the sum of z-components to be $m = -1$.\n*   The desired measurement outcome would result in a sum of z-components of $m_{total} = -2$.\n\nSince $-1 \\neq -2$, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n**5. Conclusion on Probability**\nAn event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible. The probability of an impossible event is 0.\n\n*   This is formally expressed using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which describe the projection of the coupled state onto the uncoupled states. The coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle$ is non-zero only if $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$. In this case, since $-1 \\neq -1 + (-1)$, the coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero, and its square (the probability) is also zero.\n*   Alternatively, the initial state $|2, -1\\rangle$ and the final state corresponding to the measurement $|-1, -1\\rangle$ are eigenstates of the same operator $L_z$ but with different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$ respectively). Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal, meaning their inner product is zero. The probability, being the square of this inner product, is zero.\n\n**Final Decision**\nAll provided reasoning from the candidate answers, when correctly analyzed, leads to the same conclusion: the probability is 0.

The operator relationship is:\n    $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n    This implies a strict conservation rule for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    *   From the initial state, we know the system has a total magnetic quantum number of $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   We compare the initial state's total quantum number ($m = -1$) with the required sum from the final state ($m_1 + m_2 = -2$).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. It is physically impossible to start in a state with a total z-component quantum number of $m=-1$ and end up in a configuration where the sum of the parts is $m_1+m_2 = -2$.\n    Therefore, the projection of the initial state onto the final state is zero.

The state is given in the coupled basis as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ (since they are in p-orbitals).\n    *   The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n    *   The magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum's z-component is $m=-1$. This is a crucial piece of information. It means the system is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the final state corresponding to the measurement:** The question asks for the joint probability of a specific measurement outcome.\n    *   Measurement of the first electron's z-component of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$, yields $-\\hbar$. This means its magnetic quantum number is $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   Measurement of the second electron's z-component of angular momentum, $L_{2z}$, yields $-\\hbar$. This means its magnetic quantum number is $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   This measurement corresponds to projecting the initial state onto the uncoupled basis state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the principle of conservation of angular momentum:** The operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. A direct consequence of this is that their corresponding quantum numbers must also sum:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    This is a strict selection rule. Any combination of individual measurement outcomes ($m_1, m_2$) that does not sum to the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the initial state is a physically impossible outcome.\n\n4.  **Check if the desired outcome is physically possible:**\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired measurement outcome, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check their sum: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The sum of the measured components ($m_1+m_2 = -2$) is not equal to the total magnetic quantum number of the system's initial state ($m=-1$). This violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. Therefore, the probability of this specific measurement outcome is zero.\n\n**Analysis of the Candidate Answers:**\nAll 15 candidate answers provide a correct and consistent line of reasoning based on the conservation of angular momentum (or the equivalent formalisms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and orthogonality of eigenstates). They all conclude that the probability is 0. However, some of them incorrectly map this result to the final multiple-choice letter. The correct mapping is that a probability of 0 corresponds to option D.\n\nThe correct final answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system consists of two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The crucial piece of information here is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This means the system is an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum operator, $L_z$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement Outcome:** A measurement is made of the individual z-components of angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of obtaining an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for both. This corresponds to the measurement projecting the system onto a state where the individual magnetic quantum numbers are **$m_1 = -1$** and **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Principle of Angular Momentum Addition:** The z-component of the total angular momentum is the simple sum of the individual z-components. The operator relationship is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict conservation rule for their corresponding quantum numbers: **$m = m_1 + m_2$**. This rule is also known as the selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system according to this rule.\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number: $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Draw the Conclusion:** The total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) does not equal the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers for the desired outcome ($-2$).\n    *   $-1 \\neq -2$\n    *   This violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. Therefore, the measurement outcome is physically impossible for the given initial state.\n\n6.  **Determine the Probability:** The probability of an impossible event is exactly 0.\n\nAlmost all the candidate answers present this correct line of reasoning, even though some of them arrive at an incorrect final letter. The physics is unambiguous.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State:** The system consists of two electrons whose angular momentum is described in the coupled basis. The initial state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   This tells us the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$.\n    *   It also tells us the total orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the system are $l=2$ and $m=-1$.\n    *   The crucial piece of information is $m=-1$. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum operator, $L_z$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Measurement Outcome:** The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   A measurement of the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to finding the first electron in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   A measurement of the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to finding the second electron in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   So, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** In quantum mechanics, the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. The operator relationship is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This implies a strict selection rule for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\n4.  **Check the Condition:** Let's see if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system.\n    *   The initial state has a total magnetic quantum number of $m = -1$.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome corresponds to individual magnetic quantum numbers of $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   The sum of these individual quantum numbers is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We must have the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state equal to the sum of the individual quantum numbers of the final state. However, we find that $-1 \\neq -2$.\n\n    This means the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. It is physically impossible to start with a system having a total $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$ and find it in a state with a total $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-2\\hbar$. Therefore, the probability of this measurement outcome is exactly 0.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:**\n    A) 1\n    B) 1/2\n    C) 0\n    D) 2/3\n\nThe calculated probability is 0, which corresponds to option C. All the provided candidate answers reach this same physical conclusion in their reasoning, even if some of them map it to the wrong letter choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Analysis of the Provided Solutions and Derivation of the Correct Answer**\n\nAll candidate answers, despite their differing final letter choices, utilize the same correct physical principle to analyze the problem. The core of the problem lies in the rules for adding angular momentum in quantum mechanics. Let's break down the unanimous reasoning.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:** The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   This state is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operator $L^2$ and the total z-component operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   The crucial piece of information is the total magnetic quantum number, $m = -1$. This means that if we measure the total z-component of angular momentum, the result is *always* $-1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome where:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which means the first electron is found with magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which means the second electron is found with magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental law in the coupling of angular momentum is that the z-component is conserved. The total z-component quantum number ($m$) must be equal to the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers ($m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$) that make up the state.\n    *   **Selection Rule:** $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\n4.  **Check if the Desired Outcome is Possible:** We apply the selection rule to the problem:\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual quantum numbers would be $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We find a contradiction: the initial state has a total $m = -1$, but the desired outcome requires the total to be $m = -2$. Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. Such an outcome is physically impossible.\n\n**The Probability:**\nThe probability of a physically impossible event is 0. This can be stated more formally: the probability of the measurement is given by the square of the relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. Because the selection rule $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is violated, this coefficient is exactly zero. Therefore, the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\n**Final decision:** The overwhelming majority of the candidate solutions present flawless reasoning that leads to the conclusion that the probability is 0. Several agents made an error in transcribing this result into the final letter choice. Based on the correct physical principles, the answer must be 0.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
