Identify the Initial State (t < 0)\n*   **System:** We have a spin-1/2 particle, whose spin angular momentum is described by the operator **S**. Its magnetic moment is **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   **Initial Conditions:** The particle is in a uniform magnetic field **B** = B**k̂** (pointing along the +Z axis). The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with this field.\n*   **Hamiltonian and Energy:** The interaction Hamiltonian is H = -**μ** ⋅ **B** = -γS_z B. The energy eigenstates are the eigenstates of S_z: spin-up `|+z⟩` (with S_z eigenvalue +ħ/2) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (with S_z eigenvalue -ħ/2). The corresponding energy levels are E_up = -γB(ħ/2) and E_down = +γB(ħ/2).\n*   **Lowest Energy State:** \"Aligned\" means the system is in its lowest possible energy state. Assuming γ and B are positive constants (a standard convention), the lower energy is E_up.\n*   **Conclusion for Initial State:** The state of the particle at time t=0 is the spin-up state along the Z-axis, denoted as `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian (t > 0)\n*   **The Change:** At t=0, the magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched to point along the +Y direction with the same magnitude, **B'** = B**ĵ**. The \"sudden\" approximation means the state of the system `|ψ⟩` does not change at the instant t=0.\n*   **New Hamiltonian:** For all time t > 0, the system's evolution is governed by the new Hamiltonian: H' = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γB S_y.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Time Evolution of the Expectation Value\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency of the *average* (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, we need to find the frequency of `⟨S_z(t)⟩`.\n\n#### Method 1: Larmor Precession (Intuitive, Semi-Classical)\nThe most direct way to solve this is by recognizing it as Larmor precession.\n1.  **Initial Spin:** At t=0, the spin expectation value points along the Z-axis: `⟨S(0)⟩ = ⟨+z|S|+z⟩ = (ħ/2)k̂`.\n2.  **Precession:** In the new magnetic field **B'** = B**ĵ**, the spin vector `⟨S⟩` will experience a torque, causing it to precess around the Y-axis.\n3.  **Frequency:** The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`. For a magnetic field of magnitude B, the Larmor frequency is given by:\n    `ω_L = γB`.\n4.  **Oscillation:** As the spin vector rotates in the XZ-plane around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z(t)⟩`, will oscillate sinusoidally. The frequency of this oscillation is the same as the precession frequency. Therefore, `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`. The oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n#### Method 2: Full Quantum Mechanical Calculation\nThis method provides a rigorous confirmation of the result from Larmor precession.\n1.  **State Evolution:** The state at time t is `|ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-iH't/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩ = e^(iγBt S_y / ħ)|+z⟩`.\n2.  **Expectation Value:** The expectation value of S_z at time t is `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`. Substituting the evolved state: `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨+z| e^(-iγBt S_y / ħ) S_z e^(iγBt S_y / ħ) |+z⟩`.\n3.  **Heisenberg Picture:** This expression is easier to evaluate in the Heisenberg picture, where the operators evolve in time: `S_z(t) = e^(iH't/ħ) S_z e^(-iH't/ħ)`. The evolution of `S_z` under the Hamiltonian `H' = -γBS_y` corresponds to a rotation of the S_z operator around the Y-axis by an angle `θ = γBt`. The rotated operator is `S_z(t) = S_z cos(γBt) - S_x sin(γBt)`.\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Now we take the expectation value of `S_z(t)` in the initial (time-independent) state `|+z⟩`:\n    `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨+z| (S_z cos(γBt) - S_x sin(γBt)) |+z⟩`\n    `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = cos(γBt)⟨+z|S_z|+z⟩ - sin(γBt)⟨+z|S_x|+z⟩`\n    We know that `⟨+z|S_z|+z⟩ = ħ/2` and `⟨+z|S_x|+z⟩ = 0`.\n    Therefore, `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n5.  **Frequency of μ_z:** The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`. The expression oscillates with the form `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth methods unambiguously show that the oscillation frequency is `γB`. Looking at the provided options from the candidate answers, we see the following choices are available:\n*   A) gamma*B/2\n*   B) gamma*B\n*   C) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n*   D) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nOur derived result, `γB`, corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n**Analysis of the Step-by-Step Reasoning from Candidate Answers**\n\n1.  **Initial State Identification:**\n    All candidate answers correctly identify the initial state of the system. When a magnetic moment `μ` is \"aligned\" with a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction, it means the system is in its lowest energy state. The Hamiltonian is `H = -μ · B = -γB S_z`. For a spin-1/2 particle, the energy eigenstates are spin-up (`|+z⟩`) and spin-down (`|-z⟩`). The lowest energy corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z⟩`. Therefore, at t=0, the state is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian for Time Evolution:**\n    All answers correctly identify that after the field is switched to the +Y direction, the new Hamiltonian governing the system's evolution is `H' = -μ · B' = -γB S_y`.\n\n3.  **Methods of Solution and Consensus on the Result:**\n    The candidate answers use several valid methods to find the oscillation frequency, all of which converge on the same result.\n    *   **Larmor Precession (Semi-Classical/Heisenberg Picture):** Many answers (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11) correctly argue that the expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` precesses around the new magnetic field (`Y`-axis) with the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`. Since the initial spin points along the `Z`-axis, its projection onto the `Z`-axis oscillates as `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨S_z(0)⟩cos(ω_L t)`. The frequency of this oscillation is thus `γB`.\n    *   **Schrödinger Picture (Full Quantum Calculation):** Many answers (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14) calculate the time evolution of the state vector: `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iH't/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩`. They correctly compute the time-evolved state and then calculate the expectation value `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)⟩`. The result consistently comes out to `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ ∝ cos(γBt)`, which explicitly shows an oscillation with frequency `γB`.\n    *   **Bohr Frequency (Energy Eigenstate Method):** A few answers (e.g., 2, 9, 15) use an elegant method where the initial state `|+z⟩` is expressed as a superposition of the new energy eigenstates (which are the eigenstates of `S_y`). The oscillation frequency is then given by the energy difference `ΔE` between these states, via the Bohr frequency relation `ω = ΔE/ħ`. The energy difference is found to be `ΔE = γBħ`, which gives the oscillation frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n4.  **Careful Points & Conclusion:**\n    *   The core physics of the problem is Larmor precession.\n    *   All correct physical and mathematical derivations consistently lead to the result that the oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n    *   Some of the candidate answers have chosen a final letter (e.g., A, C) that does not match their own correct derivation, indicating a mistake in the final selection step. However, the reasoning within virtually all answers is sound and points to `γB`.\n\nBased on the unanimous consensus of the correct physical reasoning across all methods, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers.\n\n### 1. Identify the Core Physics\nThe problem describes a classic scenario in quantum mechanics known as **Larmor precession**. A magnetic moment (`μ`) placed in a magnetic field (`B`) experiences a torque, causing it to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The angular frequency of this precession is called the **Larmor frequency**, `ω_L`.\n\n### 2. Determine the Initial and Final States\n*   **Initial State (t < 0):** The particle's magnetic moment (`μ = γS`) is \"aligned\" with a magnetic field in the `+Z` direction. This means the system is in its lowest energy state. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -γB * S_z`. The lowest energy state is the spin-up state `|+z⟩`, which is an eigenstate of `S_z`. At this point, the expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` points steadily along the +Z axis.\n*   **Sudden Change (t = 0):** The magnetic field is switched to the `+Y` direction (`B_new = B * ŷ`). The new Hamiltonian is `H_new = -γB * S_y`.\n*   **Evolution (t > 0):** The initial spin vector `⟨S⟩` is no longer aligned with the new magnetic field. It will begin to precess around the new field direction (the Y-axis).\n\n### 3. Calculate the Oscillation Frequency\nThere are several standard methods to calculate the frequency, all of which were demonstrated by the candidate answers.\n\n**Method A: Larmor Precession (Classical Analogy / Heisenberg Picture)**\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of the spin `⟨S⟩` is governed by the torque equation:\n`d⟨S⟩/dt = γ * ⟨S⟩ × B_new`\n\nThis equation describes the vector `⟨S⟩` precessing around the `B_new` vector (along the Y-axis) with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. As the spin vector precesses in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z⟩`, will oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the precession frequency.\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of `⟨S_z⟩` (and thus of `⟨μ_z⟩ = γ⟨S_z⟩`) is `γB`.\n\n**Method B: Full Quantum Mechanical Calculation (Schrödinger Picture)**\n1.  **Start with the initial state:** `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n2.  **Evolve the state with the new Hamiltonian** `H = -γB S_y`:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩ = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z⟩`.\n3.  **Calculate the expectation value** `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`. This calculation, performed correctly by nearly all agents, yields:\n    `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n4.  **Identify the frequency.** The expression `cos(ωt)` has an angular frequency of `ω`. By comparing this to the result `cos(γBt)`, we see the angular frequency of oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\n**Method C: Bohr Frequency Condition**\n1.  The initial state `|+z⟩` is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian (`|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`).\n2.  The energies of these new eigenstates are `E_±y = ∓γBħ/2`.\n3.  The energy difference between the populated states is `ΔE = E_{-y} - E_{+y} = γBħ`.\n4.  The system oscillates between these states at the Bohr frequency `ω = ΔE/ħ = (γBħ)/ħ = γB`.\n\n### 4. Consensus and Conclusion\nAll valid physical reasoning and correct mathematical derivations across the candidate answers lead to the same result: the oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`. Several agents arrived at the correct derivation but selected the wrong multiple-choice letter, indicating a clerical error rather than a conceptual one. The overwhelming consensus from the derivations is unambiguous.\n\nBased on the question's options:\nA) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct answer is `gamma*B`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n**1. Step-by-Step Analysis of the Physics**\n\n*   **Initial State (t < 0):** The particle's magnetic moment (`μ`) is aligned with a magnetic field (`B`) in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ · B = -γS_zB`. The state of lowest energy (\"aligned with the field\") corresponds to the spin-up state along the Z-axis. So, at t=0, the state of the particle is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n*   **New Dynamics (t ≥ 0):** The magnetic field is abruptly switched to the +Y direction. The new Hamiltonian is `H_new = -μ · B = -γS_yB`. The system, which starts in the state `|+z⟩`, will now evolve according to this new Hamiltonian.\n\n*   **Time Evolution & Precession:** The initial state `|+z⟩` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H_new`. Therefore, the system will be in a non-stationary state, and the expectation values of observables that do not commute with `H_new` (like `S_z` and `S_x`) will evolve in time. This evolution is known as Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector, `⟨S⟩`, which is initially pointing along the +Z axis, will start to precess around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis).\n\n*   **Calculating the Frequency:** There are three common ways to calculate the frequency of this precession, all of which are used by the various agents and lead to the same result.\n\n    *   **Method 1: The Larmor Frequency.** Conceptually, the precession frequency of a magnetic moment `μ = γS` in a magnetic field `B` is given directly by the Larmor frequency, `ω = γ|B|`. Since the z-component of the spin is simply one projection of this precessing vector, it must oscillate at the same frequency. This is the most direct conceptual approach and gives the answer `γB`.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Heisenberg/Ehrenfest Equations of Motion.** By calculating the time evolution of the expectation value of the `S_z` operator, `d⟨S_z⟩/dt`, one gets a set of coupled differential equations for `⟨S_z⟩` and `⟨S_x⟩`. Solving this system yields a second-order differential equation for `⟨S_z⟩`:\n        `d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = -(γB)²⟨S_z⟩`.\n        This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `x'' = -ω²x`, from which we can directly identify the angular frequency of oscillation as `ω = γB`. This method is robust and used correctly by many agents.\n\n    *   **Method 3: Schrödinger Picture.** One can calculate the time-evolved state vector `|ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩`. The result is:\n        `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩`.\n        Then, one calculates the expectation value `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`. This gives:\n        `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`.\n        Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, this simplifies to:\n        `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n        The z-component of the spin (and thus the magnetic moment) oscillates as `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω = γB`. A common mistake is to see the `γBt/2` in the spinor and assume that is the oscillation frequency, but the observable quantity oscillates at twice that frequency.\n\n**2. Analysis of Candidate Answers**\n\n*   All 15 candidate answers correctly perform the physical derivation, arriving at the same result: the oscillation frequency is `γB`. This demonstrates a strong consensus on the physics.\n*   The discrepancies in the final selected letters (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`) are due to some agents re-ordering the options in their local reasoning process.\n*   The original question's options are:\n    A) `gamma*B`\n    B) `sqrt(2)*gamma*B`\n    C) `gamma*B/2`\n    D) `gamma*B/sqrt(2)`\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe unanimous conclusion from the physical analysis of all provided answers is that the oscillation frequency is `γB`. Matching this result to the question's list of options, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis is a classic quantum mechanics problem involving Larmor precession. All the provided answers, despite choosing different letters due to a randomization of options, arrive at the same correct physical conclusion. Here is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   **System:** A spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin angular momentum operator.\n*   **Initial Conditions:** The particle is in a uniform magnetic field `B_initial = B ẑ` (along the +Z direction). The phrase \"aligned with the magnetic field\" signifies that the particle is in its lowest possible energy state.\n*   **Initial Hamiltonian:** The energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is given by the Hamiltonian `H = -μ ⋅ B`. Therefore, the initial Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -γS ⋅ (B ẑ) = -γB S_z`.\n*   **Finding the Lowest Energy State:** The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue +ħ/2) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue -ħ/2). The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = +γB(ħ/2)`. Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is the spin-up state `|+z⟩`.\n*   **Conclusion:** The initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`. The expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` initially points along the +Z axis.\n\n### 2. Identifying the New Hamiltonian (t > 0)\n\n*   **The Change:** At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to point along the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new field is `B_new = B ŷ`.\n*   **The \"Sudden\" Approximation:** In quantum mechanics, a \"sudden\" change means the process is too fast for the state vector to change during the transition. Therefore, at the instant right after the switch (`t=0+`), the particle's state is still `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n*   **New Hamiltonian:** For all `t > 0`, the system's evolution is governed by the new Hamiltonian: `H = -μ ⋅ B_new = -γS ⋅ (B ŷ) = -γB S_y`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe initial state `|+z⟩` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H` (which depends on `S_y`), so the state will evolve in time. We want to find the oscillation frequency of `⟨μ_z(t)⟩`. This can be done in several ways.\n\n#### Method 1: Larmor Precession (Intuitive Approach)\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` follows the classical torque equation: `d⟨S⟩/dt = γ⟨S⟩ × B`.\n*   Initially, `⟨S⟩` points along the Z-axis.\n*   The new `B` field points along the Y-axis.\n*   The torque `γ⟨S⟩ × B` is initially along the `-X` direction (`Z × Y = -X`).\nThis torque causes the spin vector `⟨S⟩` to precess around the Y-axis. The frequency of this precession is a well-known result called the **Larmor frequency**, `ω_L = |γB|`.\nAs the spin vector rotates in the XZ-plane, its projection onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z⟩`, will oscillate with this same frequency. Since `⟨μ_z⟩` is just `γ⟨S_z⟩`, it also oscillates with the frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n#### Method 2: Heisenberg Equation of Motion (Formal Approach)\n\nWe can find the time evolution of the `S_z` operator.\n1.  `d<S_z>/dt = (1/iħ) <[S_z, H]> = (-γB/iħ) <[S_z, S_y]>`\n2.  Using the spin commutation relation `[S_y, S_z] = iħS_x`, we get `[S_z, S_y] = -iħS_x`.\n3.  Substituting this in gives: `d<S_z>/dt = (-γB/iħ) (-iħ<S_x>) = γB <S_x>`.\n4.  Similarly, we find `d<S_x>/dt = -γB <S_z>`.\n5.  Differentiating the first result and substituting the second gives:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB d<S_x>/dt = γB (-γB <S_z>) = -(γB)² <S_z>`\n6.  This is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`, with the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n#### Method 3: Full Time Evolution (Most Detailed)\n\nAs many of the provided answers show, we can evolve the state vector `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(iγBt S_y / ħ) |+z⟩` and then explicitly calculate `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)⟩`. This calculation yields:\n`⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`\nBy inspecting this result, we see that it is a cosine function of time. The general form is `A cos(ωt)`. Comparing the forms, the angular frequency `ω` is `γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll valid physical methods consistently show that the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. This is the Larmor frequency.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nThe correct answer is `gamma*B`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Physics Problem**: The core of the problem involves a spin-1/2 particle initially in its lowest energy state (spin-up, aligned with a magnetic field along +Z). This field is then suddenly switched to the +Y direction. We need to find the oscillation frequency of the z-component of its magnetic moment, `⟨μz⟩`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physical Principle**: This scenario is a classic example of **Larmor precession**. A magnetic moment `μ` (or its associated spin `S`) in a magnetic field `B` experiences a torque that causes its expectation value `⟨S⟩` to precess around the direction of `B`. The angular frequency of this precession is called the **Larmor frequency**, `ω_L`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Larmor Frequency**: The Larmor frequency is given by the formula `ω_L = |γB|`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `B` is the magnitude of the magnetic field. In this problem, the new magnetic field has magnitude `B`, so the precession frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Motion**:\n    *   The initial spin expectation value `⟨S(0)⟩` points along the +Z axis.\n    *   The new magnetic field `B` points along the +Y axis.\n    *   Therefore, the spin vector `⟨S⟩` will precess around the Y-axis.\n    *   As this vector rotates in the XZ-plane, its projection onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z(t)⟩`, will oscillate.\n    *   The frequency of this oscillation is identical to the precession frequency. Thus, the oscillation frequency of `⟨S_z(t)⟩`—and by extension, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩` since `μ_z = γS_z`—is `ω = γB`.\n\n5.  **Review the Candidate Answers' Reasoning**:\n    *   A vast majority of the provided answers (Answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) correctly identify the physics.\n    *   They employ several valid methods to prove the result:\n        *   **Heisenberg Picture**: Solving the operator equations of motion `d<S_k>/dt = (1/iħ) <[S_k, H]>`, which yields a simple harmonic oscillator equation for `⟨S_z⟩` with frequency `ω = γB` (e.g., Answers 5, 10).\n        *   **Schrödinger Picture**: Expressing the initial state `|+z⟩` in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian (`-γBS_y`), applying the time evolution operator, and calculating `⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`. This results in a term proportional to `cos(γBt)` (e.g., Answers 2, 4, 8, 12, 14).\n        *   **Bohr Frequency**: Noting that the initial state is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. The oscillation frequency is then `ω = ΔE/ħ`, which again yields `ω = γB` (e.g., Answers 2, 9, 15).\n        *   **Larmor Precession Concept**: Directly applying the concept of Larmor precession (e.g., Answers 1, 7, 13).\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Conclude**: All correct physical derivations unanimously conclude that the oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`. The disagreements in the final letter choices (e.g., `<<<A>>>`, `<<<B>>>`, `<<<C>>>`, `<<<D>>>`) seem to arise from inconsistent ordering of the options presented to each candidate.

Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Physical Situation**\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):** The spin-1/2 particle is in a magnetic field `B` pointing in the `+Z` direction. The phrase \"aligned with a magnetic field\" means the particle is in its lowest energy eigenstate. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ · B = -γB S_z`. The energy levels are `E = -γB m_s ħ`, where `m_s` can be `+1/2` or `-1/2`. The lowest energy state corresponds to spin-up along the z-axis, `|+z⟩`, which is the eigenstate of `S_z` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`. So, at `t=0`, the state is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n2.  **Sudden Change (t = 0):** The Z-field is turned off and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the `+Y` direction. The \"sudden\" approximation in quantum mechanics implies that the state of the system does not change at the instant of the switch. The system's evolution for `t > 0` is now governed by the new Hamiltonian: `H = -μ · B' = -γB S_y`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution (t > 0):** The initial state `|+z⟩` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H = -γB S_y`. Therefore, the state will evolve in time, leading to an oscillation in the expectation values of observables that do not commute with `H`, such as `S_z`.\n\n### **Method 1: Larmor Precession**\n\nThis is the most direct physical picture. An initial spin vector `⟨S⟩` placed in a magnetic field `B'` will precess (rotate) around the direction of `B'` with an angular frequency `ω` known as the **Larmor frequency**.\n\n*   The Larmor frequency is given by `ω = |γB'|`. In this problem, the magnitude of the new field is `B`, so `ω = γB`.\n*   Initially, the spin points along the Z-axis: `⟨S(0)⟩` is in the `+z` direction.\n*   The new field `B'` is along the Y-axis.\n*   The spin vector `⟨S(t)⟩` will precess around the Y-axis. As it rotates in the XZ-plane, its projection onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z(t)⟩`, will oscillate between its maximum and minimum values.\n*   The frequency of this oscillation is the frequency of the precession itself, which is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n*   Since `⟨μ_z⟩ = γ⟨S_z⟩`, it oscillates with the same frequency.\n\n### **Method 2: Quantum Mechanical Calculation**\n\nWe can solve this rigorously using the equations of motion for the expectation values (Ehrenfest's theorem, which is equivalent to the Heisenberg picture for this case).\n\n1.  The time evolution of the expectation value of `S_z` is given by:\n    `d<S_z>/dt = (1/iħ) <[S_z, H]> = (1/iħ) <[S_z, -γB S_y]> = (-γB/iħ) <[S_z, S_y]>`\n    Using the spin commutation relation `[S_y, S_z] = iħS_x`, we get `[S_z, S_y] = -iħS_x`.\n    `d<S_z>/dt = (-γB/iħ) (-iħ<S_x>) = γB<S_x>`\n\n2.  This result depends on `<S_x>`, so we find its equation of motion as well:\n    `d<S_x>/dt = (1/iħ) <[S_x, H]> = (-γB/iħ) <[S_x, S_y]>`\n    Using the commutation relation `[S_x, S_y] = iħS_z`:\n    `d<S_x>/dt = (-γB/iħ) (iħ<S_z>) = -γB<S_z>`\n\n3.  We now have a system of two coupled differential equations. Differentiate the first equation with respect to time:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB d<S_x>/dt`\n    Substitute the second equation into this:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB (-γB<S_z>) = -(γB)² <S_z>`\n\n4.  This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`. By comparison, the angular frequency of oscillation `ω` is `γB`.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBoth the physical picture of Larmor precession and the rigorous quantum mechanical calculation show that the oscillation frequency is `γB`. Examining the provided candidate answers:\n\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B\nD) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe correct answer is `γB`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   **System Setup:** A spin-1/2 particle has a magnetic moment `μ` proportional to its spin `S`, given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   **Initial Field:** A magnetic field `B` is applied in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian (energy operator) is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γS ⋅ (0, 0, B) = -γBS_z`.\n*   **Initial State:** The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This implies the particle is in its lowest possible energy state.\n    *   The eigenstates of the `S_z` operator are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming `γ` is positive, the lowest energy is `E_up`, which corresponds to the `|+z⟩` state.\n    *   Therefore, the state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the System Dynamics (t > 0)\n\n*   **Sudden Change:** At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is applied in the +Y direction. The state vector `|ψ⟩` does not have time to change during this instantaneous switch, so at `t=0+` the state is still `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n*   **New Hamiltonian:** For all `t > 0`, the system evolves according to the new Hamiltonian `H' = -μ ⋅ B = -γS ⋅ (0, B, 0) = -γBS_y`.\n\n### 3. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\n\nWe need to find the frequency at which the expectation value `⟨μ_z(t)⟩` oscillates. Since `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩`, this is equivalent to finding the oscillation frequency of `⟨S_z(t)⟩`. All the provided correct solutions use one of three main methods to find this.\n\n#### Method 1: Larmor Precession (Semi-Classical Approach)\nThis is the most direct physical picture.\n*   The time evolution of the spin expectation value `⟨S⟩` follows the classical torque equation: `d⟨S⟩/dt = ⟨μ⟩ × B' = γ(⟨S⟩ × B')`.\n*   This equation describes the precession of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` around the new magnetic field `B'` (which is along the Y-axis).\n*   The angular frequency of this precession is the **Larmor frequency**, given by `ω = γB`.\n*   The initial spin vector `⟨S(0)⟩` points along the Z-axis. As it precesses around the Y-axis, it rotates in the XZ plane. Its projection onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z(t)⟩`, will therefore oscillate sinusoidally with the Larmor frequency.\n*   **Conclusion:** The oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n#### Method 2: Full Quantum Calculation (Schrödinger Picture)\n*   The state evolves as `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iH't/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩ = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ)|+z⟩`.\n*   Using matrix representations (`S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`), one can find the evolution operator `U(t)` and apply it to the initial state vector `|+z⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ`.\n*   This yields the state at time `t`: `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩`.\n*   Calculating the expectation value `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩` gives:\n    `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)[cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n*   Using the double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, this simplifies to:\n    `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n*   The z-component of the magnetic moment is `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`. This function oscillates with angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n#### Method 3: Bohr Frequency (Energy Eigenstates)\n*   The initial state `|+z⟩` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H' = -γBS_y`. It is a superposition of the eigenstates of `H'`, which are `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`.\n    *   `|+z⟩ = (1/√2) (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)`\n*   The system is in a superposition of two energy levels. The energy eigenvalues corresponding to `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩` are `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_- = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   An observable in a superposition of two energy states will oscillate with the Bohr frequency, `ω = ΔE/ħ`.\n*   `ΔE = E_- - E_+ = γBħ`.\n*   `ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\nAll valid physical reasoning points to the same result. The average of the z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. This is the Larmor frequency.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial State Analysis:** The problem describes a spin-1/2 particle whose magnetic moment `μ` is \"aligned\" with a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. The interaction Hamiltonian is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γS ⋅ B = -γBS_z`. \"Aligned\" implies the particle is in its lowest energy state. The eigenvalues of `-γBS_z` are `-γB(ħ/2)` (for the spin-up state `|+z>`) and `+γB(ħ/2)` (for the spin-down state `|-z>`). The lowest energy state is therefore `|+z>`, assuming `γ` is positive. So, at time `t=0`, the state of the system is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian and Dynamics:** At `t=0`, the field is suddenly switched to the `+Y` direction. The new Hamiltonian is `H' = -γBS_y`. Since the initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H'`, the state will evolve in time. This time evolution is known as Larmor precession.\n\n3.  **Core Physical Principle: Larmor Precession:** A magnetic moment (or the expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩`) in a magnetic field `B` experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the field. The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, given by `ω_L = |γB|`. In this case, the initial spin vector `⟨S⟩` points along the Z-axis, and the new magnetic field `B'` is along the Y-axis. The spin vector will therefore precess in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis.\n\n4.  **Deriving the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   As the `⟨S⟩` vector precesses in the X-Z plane, its projection onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z⟩`, will vary sinusoidally.\n    *   The angle of the `⟨S⟩` vector with respect to the Z-axis at time `t` will be `θ(t) = ω_L * t`.\n    *   The z-component will therefore be `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨S_z(0)⟩ * cos(ω_L * t) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The z-component of the magnetic moment is `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   This expression is a cosine function of time with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n5.  **Cross-Verification from Agent Analysis:** A vast majority of the provided answers (at least 13 out of 15) correctly derive this result, `ω = γB`, using various rigorous methods, including:\n    *   The Heisenberg picture (equations of motion for operators).\n    *   The Schrödinger picture (explicit time-evolution of the state vector).\n    *   The Bohr frequency condition (`ω = ΔE/ħ`).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** All correct physical derivations lead to the same conclusion: the oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`. The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers are due to either different option mappings or simple human error.\n\n7.  **Final Answer Selection:** Based on the universally derived physical result `γB` and the provided options:\n    A) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n    B) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n    C) gamma*B/2\n    D) gamma*B\n\n    The correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a standard problem in quantum mechanics concerning the time evolution of a spin-1/2 particle, a phenomenon known as Larmor precession. I will synthesize the arguments from the provided candidate answers to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial State (`t < 0`)**:\n    *   The system is a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment `μ = γS`.\n    *   It is in a magnetic field `B` pointing along the +Z direction (`B_vec = B * z_hat`).\n    *   The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ · B = -γB S_z`.\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned with the field.\" This implies the system is in its lowest energy state.\n    *   The energy eigenstates of `H_initial` are the spin-up `|+z>` (with `S_z` eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (with `S_z` eigenvalue `-ħ/2`) states.\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming the gyromagnetic ratio `γ` is positive, the lowest energy state is `E_up`. Thus, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. All candidate analyses correctly identify this as the starting point.\n\n2.  **Sudden Change and New Dynamics (`t ≥ 0`)**:\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction (`B'_vec = B * y_hat`).\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the system's time evolution is `H = -μ · B' = -γB S_y`.\n\n3.  **Determining the Oscillation Frequency**:\n    All candidate answers correctly identify that the problem is to find the angular frequency of the oscillation of the expectation value `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩`. They employ several valid methods, all leading to the same physical result.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Larmor Precession (Semi-classical)**: The expectation value of the spin vector, `⟨S⟩`, behaves like a classical magnetic moment. It experiences a torque from the new magnetic field (`B'`) which causes it to precess around the direction of `B'` (the Y-axis). The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, given by `ω = γB`. Since the Z-component of `⟨S⟩` is oscillating as the vector precesses, its frequency of oscillation is `γB`. This is shown correctly in answers 1, 3, 7, and 13.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Full Quantum Calculation (Schrödinger Picture)**: This involves calculating the state at a later time `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)>` and then finding the expectation value `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)>`. As shown in great detail in answers 2, 4, 8, 12, 13 and 14, this calculation leads to:\n        `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n        This expression describes an oscillation of the form `A*cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω` is clearly `γB`.\n\n    *   **Method 3: Bohr Frequency**: The initial state `|+z>` can be written as a superposition of the new energy eigenstates (which are the eigenstates of `S_y`, i.e., `|+y>` and `|-y>`). The energy difference between these states is `ΔE = γBħ`. An observable that is not conserved (like `S_z`) will oscillate with the Bohr frequency `ω = ΔE/ħ = γBħ/ħ = γB`. This elegant argument is used in answers 2, 9, and 15.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll physically sound methods of derivation unanimously conclude that the oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n\nNow, we match this result to the given options:\n\n*   A) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n*   B) gamma*B\n*   C) gamma*B/2\n*   D) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe derived frequency `γB` corresponds exactly to option B. While some of the candidate agents correctly derived the physics but made a clerical error in selecting the final letter, the physical reasoning is robust and points to a single answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a standard problem in quantum mechanics concerning Larmor precession. Here's a breakdown of the physics and the step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   A spin-1/2 particle has its magnetic moment `μ` \"aligned\" with a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. The Hamiltonian (energy operator) is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γB S_z`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S_z` is the z-component of the spin operator.\n    *   Being \"aligned\" means the particle is in its lowest energy eigenstate. The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin-up) and `-ħ/2` (spin-down). The corresponding energies are `E = -γB(±ħ/2)`. Assuming `γ` is positive, the lowest energy state is the one with the maximum spin projection, which is the spin-up state `|+z⟩`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`. The expectation value of the spin vector at this moment is purely in the z-direction: `⟨S⟩ = (0, 0, ħ/2)`.\n\n2.  **Sudden Change and New Dynamics (t > 0):**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is instantaneously switched to the `+Y` direction, so the new field is `B_new = B ĵ`.\n    *   The particle's state has no time to change during the switch. For `t > 0`, the state evolves under the new Hamiltonian: `H_new = -μ ⋅ B_new = -γB S_y`.\n    *   The initial state `|+z⟩` is not an eigenstate of `S_y`, so it will evolve over time.\n\n3.  **Larmor Precession:**\n    *   This situation leads to a phenomenon called Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector, `⟨S⟩`, behaves like a classical gyroscope. It will precess around the direction of the new magnetic field (the Y-axis).\n    *   The angular frequency of this precession is known as the **Larmor frequency**, which is given by the formula `ω = γB`.\n\n4.  **Oscillation of the Z-Component:**\n    *   The initial spin expectation vector `⟨S⟩` points along the Z-axis. As it precesses around the Y-axis, its tip traces a circle in the XZ-plane.\n    *   The projection of this rotating vector onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z(t)⟩`, will oscillate as the cosine of the angle of rotation. The angle of rotation at time `t` is `ωt = (γB)t`.\n    *   Thus, `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨S_z(0)⟩ * cos(γBt) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   From this expression, it is clear that the quantity oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll valid methods of analysis (including using the Schrödinger equation with time-evolution operators, or the Heisenberg equations of motion for the spin operators) converge on the same result. The oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency.\n\n*   **Larmor Frequency:** `ω = γB`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma\\*B/sqrt(2)\nB) gamma\\*B\nC) sqrt(2)\\*gamma\\*B\nD) gamma\\*B/2\n\nThe correct choice is B. The vast majority of the provided candidate solutions correctly derived this result through various rigorous methods, even though some made a mistake in selecting the final letter option. The physics is unambiguous.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis is a classic problem in quantum mechanics concerning Larmor precession. I will analyze the problem and the provided answers step by step.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physics Problem\n\n*   **Step 1: Initial State (t < 0)**\n    *   A spin-1/2 particle is in a magnetic field `B` pointing along the +Z axis.\n    *   The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ · B = -γS_z B`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field, meaning it is in its lowest energy eigenstate. The energy levels are `E = -γB m_s ħ`. Assuming the gyromagnetic ratio `γ` and field `B` are positive, the lowest energy corresponds to the largest spin projection, so the particle is in the spin-up state along Z.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n*   **Step 2: New Dynamics (t > 0)**\n    *   The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the system's time evolution is `H = -μ · B = -γS_y B`.\n    *   The initial state `|+z⟩` is not an eigenstate of this new Hamiltonian, so the state will evolve over time.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determining the Oscillation Frequency**\n    The question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is proportional to `⟨S_z(t)⟩`, and will have the same frequency.\n\n    There are multiple standard ways to solve this, as demonstrated by the candidate answers:\n\n    *   **Method A: Larmor Precession:** Classically, a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` precesses around the direction of `B` with an angular frequency `ω_L = γB`. Quantum mechanically, the *expectation value* of the spin `⟨S⟩` follows this same classical motion. Since the initial spin points along Z and the field is now along Y, `⟨S⟩` will precess in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis. The projection of this vector onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z(t)⟩`, will oscillate with the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. This is the most direct conceptual approach.\n\n    *   **Method B: Full Quantum Calculation (Schrödinger Picture):** One calculates the time evolution of the state `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩` and then computes `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`. As correctly shown in many of the candidate answers (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 12, 13, 14), this yields `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`. The oscillation is described by `cos(ωt)` where the angular frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\n    *   **Method C: Bohr Frequency:** The initial state `|+z⟩` is a superposition of the two eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian `H=-γBS_y`. These new eigenstates `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩` have an energy difference `ΔE = E_{-y} - E_{+y} = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`. The system will oscillate between the components of the superposition at the Bohr frequency `ω = ΔE/ħ = (γBħ)/ħ = γB`. This method is correctly applied in answers 2, 9, and 15.\n\n    *   **Method D: Heisenberg Picture:** One can look at the time evolution of the operators. As shown in answers 5 and 10, this leads to a pair of coupled differential equations for the expectation values, which resolve into the simple harmonic oscillator equation `d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = -(γB)²⟨S_z⟩`. This again shows the angular frequency of oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Candidate Answers\n\n*   **Reasoning Consistency:** Almost all candidate answers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) correctly apply one or more of the valid physical methods described above. Their step-by-step reasoning is sound and consistently concludes that the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n*   **Final Answer Inconsistency:** There is significant confusion among the candidates regarding which letter option corresponds to the correct answer `γB`. For example, Answers 6, 14, and 15 derive `γB` but select `<<<A>>>`, which is `gamma*B/sqrt(2)`. This is an internal contradiction. However, the *derivation* in these answers is still correct. The overwhelming consensus of the physical derivations is that the frequency is `γB`.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nAll valid physical and mathematical derivations point to a single result: the oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`. I will base my final decision on this solid conclusion from the physics, disregarding the clear errors in mapping the result to an option letter made by some agents.\n\nBased on the original question's options:\nA) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nThe correct value `γB` corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers and ensuring all key points are addressed.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Initial State (t < 0)**\n\n*   **The System:** We have a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin angular momentum is described by the vector operator **S** = (S_x, S_y, S_z).\n*   **Magnetic Moment:** The particle has a magnetic moment **μ** proportional to its spin, given by **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   **Initial Hamiltonian:** The particle is in a magnetic field **B**_initial = B**ẑ** (pointing along the +Z axis). The energy of the particle is given by the Hamiltonian H_initial = -**μ** ⋅ **B**_initial = -γ**S** ⋅ (B**ẑ**) = -γBS_z.\n*   **Identifying the State:** The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the system is in its lowest possible energy state.\n    *   The eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are the eigenstates of S_z, which are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue `m_s = +ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue `m_s = -ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energy levels are E = -γBm_sħ. Assuming γ and B are positive constants, the energy for the spin-up state is E_up = -γB(ħ/2), and for the spin-down state is E_down = +γB(ħ/2).\n    *   The lowest energy state is the spin-up state, `|+z⟩`.\n*   **Conclusion on Initial State:** At time t=0, the state of the particle is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n### **2. Analyze the System Dynamics (t > 0)**\n\n*   **Sudden Change:** At t=0, the magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched. The field along the Z-axis is removed, and a new field **B**_new = B**ŷ** (same magnitude, but along the +Y axis) is applied. \"Sudden\" means the state vector `|ψ⟩` does not have time to change, so at t=0+, the state is still `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n*   **New Hamiltonian:** For all time t > 0, the system evolves according to the new Hamiltonian, H = -**μ** ⋅ **B**_new = -γ**S** ⋅ (B**ŷ**) = -γBS_y.\n\n### **3. Determine the Oscillation Frequency**\n\nThe initial state `|+z⟩` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H = -γBS_y`. Therefore, the system is in a superposition of the new energy eigenstates, which will cause the expectation values of certain observables (like μ_z) to oscillate. We can find this frequency in several ways.\n\n#### **Method 1: Larmor Precession (Semi-classical View)**\n\nThis is the most direct and physically intuitive approach.\n1.  The expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` follows the classical equation of motion for a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field: d`⟨S⟩`/dt = **μ** × **B** = γ`⟨S⟩` × **B**.\n2.  This equation describes the precession of the vector `⟨S⟩` around the direction of the magnetic field **B** (in this case, the Y-axis).\n3.  The angular frequency of this precession is known as the **Larmor frequency**, `ω_L`. Its magnitude is given by `ω_L = |γB|`.\n4.  At t=0, the spin vector `⟨S(0)⟩` points along the Z-axis. For t>0, this vector begins to precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane.\n5.  As the vector rotates, its projection onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z(t)⟩`, oscillates between its maximum value (+ħ/2) and minimum value (-ħ/2). The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the precession frequency, `ω_L`.\n6.  Therefore, the oscillation frequency of `⟨S_z⟩`, and consequently of `⟨μ_z⟩ = γ⟨S_z⟩`, is `ω = γB`.\n\n#### **Method 2: Full Quantum Calculation (Schrödinger Picture)**\n\n1.  **Time-Evolved State:** The state at time `t` is `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩ = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ)|+z⟩`.\n2.  **Calculate Expectation Value:** We need `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)⟩`. Let `ω = γB`.\n    *   `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩ = ⟨+z| exp(-iωtS_y/ħ) S_z exp(iωtS_y/ħ) |+z⟩`.\n    *   The operator `exp(-iθS_n/ħ)` represents a rotation around the axis **n** by an angle θ. Our calculation shows the evolution of the S_z operator in the Heisenberg picture: `S_z(t) = S_z cos(ωt) - S_x sin(ωt)`.\n    *   Now, we take the expectation value in the initial state `|+z⟩`:\n        `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨+z| (S_z cos(ωt) - S_x sin(ωt)) |+z⟩`\n        `= cos(ωt)⟨+z|S_z|+z⟩ - sin(ωt)⟨+z|S_x|+z⟩`\n    *   We know `⟨+z|S_z|+z⟩ = ħ/2` and `⟨+z|S_x|+z⟩ = 0`.\n    *   Therefore, `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(ωt) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n3.  **Result:** The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`. This is a function that oscillates with angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n#### **Method 3: Bohr Frequency Condition**\n\n1.  The initial state `|+z⟩` is a superposition of the new energy eigenstates (`|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`). `|+z⟩ = (1/√2) (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)`.\n2.  The energy difference between these two states is `ΔE = E_{-y} - E_{+y} = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n3.  The frequency of oscillation for observables is given by the Bohr frequency condition: `ω = ΔE/ħ`.\n4.  `ω = (γBħ)/ħ = γB`.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll three methods consistently show that the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`, which is the Larmor frequency.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct answer is `gamma*B`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a classic problem of Larmor precession in quantum mechanics. Let's analyze it step-by-step, synthesizing the correct reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Initial State (t < 0)\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its magnetic moment `μ` is related to its spin `S` by the gyromagnetic ratio `γ`, such that `μ = γS`.\n*   Initially, a magnetic field of magnitude `B` is applied in the `+Z` direction. The Hamiltonian of the system is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(S_z)B`.\n*   The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This implies the system is in its lowest possible energy state. The eigenstates of `H_initial` are the same as for `S_z`: spin-up `|+z⟩` (with energy `E_up = -γBħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (with energy `E_down = +γBħ/2`).\n*   Assuming `γ` is positive, the lowest energy state is the spin-up state. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the New Hamiltonian for Time Evolution (t > 0)\n*   At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off and a new magnetic field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the `+Y` direction.\n*   The new Hamiltonian `H` governs the time evolution for `t > 0`. This Hamiltonian is `H = -μ ⋅ B_new = -γ(S_y)B`.\n*   The initial state `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩` is not an eigenstate of this new Hamiltonian, so the state will evolve over time.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Oscillation Frequency\nWe need to find the oscillation frequency of the expectation value `⟨μ_z(t)⟩`. This can be done in a few ways, all of which are demonstrated in the candidate answers and lead to the same result.\n\n**Method 1: Larmor Precession**\nThis is the most direct physical picture. The time evolution of the expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` follows the classical equation for a magnetic top:\n`d⟨S⟩/dt = γ⟨S⟩ × B`\n\n*   The initial spin expectation value is `⟨S(0)⟩ = ⟨+z|S|+z⟩`, which points purely along the Z-axis.\n*   The new magnetic field `B` is along the Y-axis.\n*   The equation describes a precession of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` around the magnetic field `B` (the Y-axis) with a constant angular frequency known as the **Larmor frequency**, `ω_L`.\n*   The Larmor frequency is given by `ω_L = γB`.\n*   As the spin vector `⟨S⟩` precesses in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z(t)⟩`, oscillates. The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the Larmor frequency.\n*   Since `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩`, the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates at the same frequency.\n*   Therefore, the oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\n**Method 2: Full Quantum Calculation (Schrödinger Picture)**\n1.  **Time-evolved State:** The state at time `t` is `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩ = exp(iγBS_y t/ħ) |+z⟩`.\n2.  **Calculation:** We can evaluate this using the matrix forms for the spin operators (the Pauli matrices). The state at time `t` becomes:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩`\n3.  **Expectation Value:** We then calculate the expectation value `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n    `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n4.  **Trigonometric Identity:** Using the identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, this simplifies to:\n    `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n5.  **Final Result:** `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    This function oscillates as `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n**Method 3: Bohr Frequency**\n1.  **Express Initial State:** Express the initial state `|+z⟩` in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian `H = -γBS_y`. The eigenstates are `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`. We find `|+z⟩ = (1/√2)(|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)`.\n2.  **Energy Difference:** The energy difference between the two populated states is `ΔE = E_{-y} - E_{+y} = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n3.  **Bohr Frequency:** Any observable that is not conserved (like `S_z` or `μ_z`) will oscillate with the Bohr frequency `ω = ΔE/ħ`.\n    `ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\nAll three methods unequivocally show that the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. This corresponds to option B. The candidate answers show strong consensus on the reasoning, although some have typos in their final letter choice due to variations in the provided option list. The correct physical answer is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem**\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):** The problem states that a spin-1/2 particle has its magnetic moment `μ` aligned with a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ · B = -γ(S_x, S_y, S_z) · (0, 0, B) = -γB S_z`. Being \"aligned\" means the system is in its lowest energy state. The energy levels are determined by the eigenvalues of `S_z`, which are `±ħ/2`. The energies are `E = -γB(m_sħ)`. To minimize energy (assuming `γ` is a positive constant), we need to maximize `m_s`, so the particle must be in the spin-up state along Z. Thus, the initial state vector at t=0 is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n2.  **Sudden Change and New Dynamics (t > 0):** At t=0, the magnetic field is abruptly switched to the +Y direction. The new field is `B_new = (0, B, 0)`. The Hamiltonian governing the time evolution for `t > 0` becomes `H_new = -μ · B_new = -γB S_y`. The state `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩` is not an eigenstate of this new Hamiltonian, so it will evolve over time.\n\n3.  **Larmor Precession:** The physical phenomenon described is Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩`, which initially points along the Z-axis, will precess around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis). The angular frequency of this precession is a well-known quantity called the Larmor frequency.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Frequency:** The Larmor frequency `ω_L` is given by the formula `ω_L = |γB|`. As the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis, its components in the X-Z plane oscillate. Specifically, the projection of the spinning vector onto the Z-axis, which is `⟨S_z(t)⟩`, will oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is exactly the Larmor frequency.\n\n5.  **Formal Derivation (Heisenberg Picture):** To confirm this, we can use the equations of motion for the expectation values:\n    *   `d⟨S_z⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨[S_z, H]⟩ = (1/iħ)⟨[S_z, -γBS_y]⟩ = (-γB/iħ)⟨[S_z, S_y]⟩`\n    *   Using the spin commutation relation `[S_y, S_z] = iħS_x`, we get `[S_z, S_y] = -iħS_x`.\n    *   `d⟨S_z⟩/dt = (-γB/iħ)(-iħ⟨S_x⟩) = γB⟨S_x⟩` (Equation 1)\n    *   Similarly, `d⟨S_x⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨[S_x, -γBS_y]⟩ = (-γB/iħ)⟨[S_x, S_y]⟩ = (-γB/iħ)(iħ⟨S_z⟩) = -γB⟨S_z⟩` (Equation 2)\n\n    To find the oscillation of `⟨S_z⟩`, we differentiate Equation 1 and substitute Equation 2:\n    *   `d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = γB * d⟨S_x⟩/dt`\n    *   `d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = γB * (-γB⟨S_z⟩) = -(γB)²⟨S_z⟩`\n\n    This is the classic equation for a simple harmonic oscillator `x'' = -ω²x`, where the angular frequency `ω` is clearly `γB`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The expectation value of the z-component of spin `⟨S_z(t)⟩` oscillates with an angular frequency of `γB`. Since the z-component of the magnetic moment is directly proportional to it (`⟨μ_z⟩ = γ⟨S_z⟩`), it oscillates with the same frequency.\n\n**Comparison with Provided Options**\n\n*   A) `sqrt(2)*gamma*B`\n*   B) `gamma*B/2`\n*   C) `gamma*B`\n*   D) `gamma*B/sqrt(2)`\n\nOur derived oscillation frequency is `γB`, which matches option C.

    "This is a classic problem in quantum mechanics regarding the behavior of a spin in a magnetic field, a phenomenon known as Larmor precession. Here is a step-by-step analysis based on the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial State Identification (t < 0):**\n    The problem states that a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment (`μ = γS`) is \"aligned\" with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction (`B_z = B k̂`). This means the system is in its lowest energy state. The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γB S_z`. The energy levels are `E = -γB(m_s ħ)`, where `m_s` can be `+1/2` (spin-up) or `-1/2` (spin-down). To minimize energy, the spin projection `m_s` must be maximized (assuming a positive gyromagnetic ratio `γ`). Thus, the particle is in the spin-up state along the Z-axis, denoted as `|+z⟩`. All candidate answers correctly identify this as the initial state `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n2.  **Sudden Change and New Dynamics (t ≥ 0):**\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is instantaneously switched to the +Y direction (`B_y = B ĵ`). The new Hamiltonian governing the system's evolution is `H' = -γB S_y`. The \"sudden\" approximation implies that the state of the particle does not have time to change during the switch, so it starts evolving from the initial state `|+z⟩`.\n\n3.  **Physical Principle and Derivation of Frequency:**\n    The initial state `|+z⟩` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H'`, which depends on `S_y`. This non-stationary state will evolve, causing the expectation values of observables that don't commute with `H'` (like `S_z`) to oscillate. This oscillation is a manifestation of **Larmor Precession**.\n\n    There are three main, equivalent ways to calculate the frequency, all of which were successfully used by the candidate answers:\n    *   **Method 1: Larmor Frequency (Conceptual)**: The expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` behaves like a classical vector and precesses around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis). The angular frequency of this precession is given by the Larmor formula `ω = γB`. As the vector `⟨S⟩` (which starts along Z) rotates in the XZ-plane, its projection onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z⟩`, oscillates with this same frequency. This is the most direct physical insight.\n    *   **Method 2: Schrödinger/Heisenberg Picture (Formal Calculation)**: By formally solving the equations of motion for the system (either by evolving the state vector or the operators), one can find the time-dependence of the expectation value `⟨S_z(t)⟩`. This calculation, correctly performed by numerous agents, yields `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`. This explicitly shows an oscillation of the form `cos(ωt)` with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n    *   **Method 3: Bohr Frequency (Energy Eigenstates)**: The initial state `|+z⟩` is a superposition of the new energy eigenstates, which are `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`. The energy difference between these states is `ΔE = γBħ`. Any observable connecting these two states will oscillate at the Bohr frequency `ω = ΔE/ħ = (γBħ)/ħ = γB`.\n\n4.  **Consensus and Final Answer:**\n    All 15 candidate answers, regardless of the method used, correctly derive that the physical oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`. The differences in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to the fact that the options were presented in a different random order to each agent. However, the physical conclusion is unanimous.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **\"Aligned with the field\"**: This is key to identifying the initial state as the lowest energy eigenstate, `|+z⟩`.\n*   **\"Suddenly\"**: This quantum approximation means the state vector `|ψ⟩` is continuous at `t=0`.\n*   **Observable's Frequency vs. State's Frequency**: When calculating in the Schrödinger picture, the state vector `|ψ(t)⟩` contains terms like `cos(γBt/2)`. A common mistake is to assume this is the oscillation frequency. However, the expectation value `⟨S_z⟩` is a quadratic function of these terms (`cos² - sin²`), which, via a trigonometric identity, doubles the frequency to `γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis of the physics and the overwhelming consensus of the candidate answers confirm that the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`. Matching this result to the specific list of options provided in the question:\n\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nThe correct answer is `gamma*B`.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Identify the Initial State (t < 0)\n*   **System:** We have a spin-1/2 particle, whose spin angular momentum is described by the operator **S**. Its magnetic moment is **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   **Initial Conditions:** The particle is in a uniform magnetic field **B** = B**k̂** (pointing along the +Z axis). The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with this field.\n*   **Hamiltonian and Energy:** The interaction Hamiltonian is H = -**μ** ⋅ **B** = -γS_z B. The energy eigenstates are the eigenstates of S_z: spin-up `|+z⟩` (with S_z eigenvalue +ħ/2) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (with S_z eigenvalue -ħ/2). The corresponding energy levels are E_up = -γB(ħ/2) and E_down = +γB(ħ/2).\n*   **Lowest Energy State:** \"Aligned\" means the system is in its lowest possible energy state. Assuming γ and B are positive constants (a standard convention), the lower energy is E_up.\n*   **Conclusion for Initial State:** The state of the particle at time t=0 is the spin-up state along the Z-axis, denoted as `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian (t > 0)\n*   **The Change:** At t=0, the magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched to point along the +Y direction with the same magnitude, **B'** = B**ĵ**. The \"sudden\" approximation means the state of the system `|ψ⟩` does not change at the instant t=0.\n*   **New Hamiltonian:** For all time t > 0, the system's evolution is governed by the new Hamiltonian: H' = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γB S_y.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Time Evolution of the Expectation Value\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency of the *average* (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, we need to find the frequency of `⟨S_z(t)⟩`.\n\n#### Method 1: Larmor Precession (Intuitive, Semi-Classical)\nThe most direct way to solve this is by recognizing it as Larmor precession.\n1.  **Initial Spin:** At t=0, the spin expectation value points along the Z-axis: `⟨S(0)⟩ = ⟨+z|S|+z⟩ = (ħ/2)k̂`.\n2.  **Precession:** In the new magnetic field **B'** = B**ĵ**, the spin vector `⟨S⟩` will experience a torque, causing it to precess around the Y-axis.\n3.  **Frequency:** The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`. For a magnetic field of magnitude B, the Larmor frequency is given by:\n    `ω_L = γB`.\n4.  **Oscillation:** As the spin vector rotates in the XZ-plane around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z(t)⟩`, will oscillate sinusoidally. The frequency of this oscillation is the same as the precession frequency. Therefore, `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`. The oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n#### Method 2: Full Quantum Mechanical Calculation\nThis method provides a rigorous confirmation of the result from Larmor precession.\n1.  **State Evolution:** The state at time t is `|ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-iH't/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩ = e^(iγBt S_y / ħ)|+z⟩`.\n2.  **Expectation Value:** The expectation value of S_z at time t is `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`. Substituting the evolved state: `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨+z| e^(-iγBt S_y / ħ) S_z e^(iγBt S_y / ħ) |+z⟩`.\n3.  **Heisenberg Picture:** This expression is easier to evaluate in the Heisenberg picture, where the operators evolve in time: `S_z(t) = e^(iH't/ħ) S_z e^(-iH't/ħ)`. The evolution of `S_z` under the Hamiltonian `H' = -γBS_y` corresponds to a rotation of the S_z operator around the Y-axis by an angle `θ = γBt`. The rotated operator is `S_z(t) = S_z cos(γBt) - S_x sin(γBt)`.\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Now we take the expectation value of `S_z(t)` in the initial (time-independent) state `|+z⟩`:\n    `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨+z| (S_z cos(γBt) - S_x sin(γBt)) |+z⟩`\n    `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = cos(γBt)⟨+z|S_z|+z⟩ - sin(γBt)⟨+z|S_x|+z⟩`\n    We know that `⟨+z|S_z|+z⟩ = ħ/2` and `⟨+z|S_x|+z⟩ = 0`.\n    Therefore, `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n5.  **Frequency of μ_z:** The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`. The expression oscillates with the form `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth methods unambiguously show that the oscillation frequency is `γB`. Looking at the provided options from the candidate answers, we see the following choices are available:\n*   A) gamma*B/2\n*   B) gamma*B\n*   C) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n*   D) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nOur derived result, `γB`, corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n**Analysis of the Step-by-Step Reasoning from Candidate Answers**\n\n1.  **Initial State Identification:**\n    All candidate answers correctly identify the initial state of the system. When a magnetic moment `μ` is \"aligned\" with a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction, it means the system is in its lowest energy state. The Hamiltonian is `H = -μ · B = -γB S_z`. For a spin-1/2 particle, the energy eigenstates are spin-up (`|+z⟩`) and spin-down (`|-z⟩`). The lowest energy corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z⟩`. Therefore, at t=0, the state is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian for Time Evolution:**\n    All answers correctly identify that after the field is switched to the +Y direction, the new Hamiltonian governing the system's evolution is `H' = -μ · B' = -γB S_y`.\n\n3.  **Methods of Solution and Consensus on the Result:**\n    The candidate answers use several valid methods to find the oscillation frequency, all of which converge on the same result.\n    *   **Larmor Precession (Semi-Classical/Heisenberg Picture):** Many answers (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11) correctly argue that the expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` precesses around the new magnetic field (`Y`-axis) with the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`. Since the initial spin points along the `Z`-axis, its projection onto the `Z`-axis oscillates as `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨S_z(0)⟩cos(ω_L t)`. The frequency of this oscillation is thus `γB`.\n    *   **Schrödinger Picture (Full Quantum Calculation):** Many answers (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14) calculate the time evolution of the state vector: `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iH't/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩`. They correctly compute the time-evolved state and then calculate the expectation value `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)⟩`. The result consistently comes out to `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ ∝ cos(γBt)`, which explicitly shows an oscillation with frequency `γB`.\n    *   **Bohr Frequency (Energy Eigenstate Method):** A few answers (e.g., 2, 9, 15) use an elegant method where the initial state `|+z⟩` is expressed as a superposition of the new energy eigenstates (which are the eigenstates of `S_y`). The oscillation frequency is then given by the energy difference `ΔE` between these states, via the Bohr frequency relation `ω = ΔE/ħ`. The energy difference is found to be `ΔE = γBħ`, which gives the oscillation frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n4.  **Careful Points & Conclusion:**\n    *   The core physics of the problem is Larmor precession.\n    *   All correct physical and mathematical derivations consistently lead to the result that the oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n    *   Some of the candidate answers have chosen a final letter (e.g., A, C) that does not match their own correct derivation, indicating a mistake in the final selection step. However, the reasoning within virtually all answers is sound and points to `γB`.\n\nBased on the unanimous consensus of the correct physical reasoning across all methods, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers.\n\n### 1. Identify the Core Physics\nThe problem describes a classic scenario in quantum mechanics known as **Larmor precession**. A magnetic moment (`μ`) placed in a magnetic field (`B`) experiences a torque, causing it to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The angular frequency of this precession is called the **Larmor frequency**, `ω_L`.\n\n### 2. Determine the Initial and Final States\n*   **Initial State (t < 0):** The particle's magnetic moment (`μ = γS`) is \"aligned\" with a magnetic field in the `+Z` direction. This means the system is in its lowest energy state. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -γB * S_z`. The lowest energy state is the spin-up state `|+z⟩`, which is an eigenstate of `S_z`. At this point, the expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` points steadily along the +Z axis.\n*   **Sudden Change (t = 0):** The magnetic field is switched to the `+Y` direction (`B_new = B * ŷ`). The new Hamiltonian is `H_new = -γB * S_y`.\n*   **Evolution (t > 0):** The initial spin vector `⟨S⟩` is no longer aligned with the new magnetic field. It will begin to precess around the new field direction (the Y-axis).\n\n### 3. Calculate the Oscillation Frequency\nThere are several standard methods to calculate the frequency, all of which were demonstrated by the candidate answers.\n\n**Method A: Larmor Precession (Classical Analogy / Heisenberg Picture)**\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of the spin `⟨S⟩` is governed by the torque equation:\n`d⟨S⟩/dt = γ * ⟨S⟩ × B_new`\n\nThis equation describes the vector `⟨S⟩` precessing around the `B_new` vector (along the Y-axis) with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. As the spin vector precesses in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z⟩`, will oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the precession frequency.\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of `⟨S_z⟩` (and thus of `⟨μ_z⟩ = γ⟨S_z⟩`) is `γB`.\n\n**Method B: Full Quantum Mechanical Calculation (Schrödinger Picture)**\n1.  **Start with the initial state:** `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n2.  **Evolve the state with the new Hamiltonian** `H = -γB S_y`:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩ = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z⟩`.\n3.  **Calculate the expectation value** `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`. This calculation, performed correctly by nearly all agents, yields:\n    `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n4.  **Identify the frequency.** The expression `cos(ωt)` has an angular frequency of `ω`. By comparing this to the result `cos(γBt)`, we see the angular frequency of oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\n**Method C: Bohr Frequency Condition**\n1.  The initial state `|+z⟩` is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian (`|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`).\n2.  The energies of these new eigenstates are `E_±y = ∓γBħ/2`.\n3.  The energy difference between the populated states is `ΔE = E_{-y} - E_{+y} = γBħ`.\n4.  The system oscillates between these states at the Bohr frequency `ω = ΔE/ħ = (γBħ)/ħ = γB`.\n\n### 4. Consensus and Conclusion\nAll valid physical reasoning and correct mathematical derivations across the candidate answers lead to the same result: the oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`. Several agents arrived at the correct derivation but selected the wrong multiple-choice letter, indicating a clerical error rather than a conceptual one. The overwhelming consensus from the derivations is unambiguous.\n\nBased on the question's options:\nA) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct answer is `gamma*B`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n**1. Step-by-Step Analysis of the Physics**\n\n*   **Initial State (t < 0):** The particle's magnetic moment (`μ`) is aligned with a magnetic field (`B`) in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ · B = -γS_zB`. The state of lowest energy (\"aligned with the field\") corresponds to the spin-up state along the Z-axis. So, at t=0, the state of the particle is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n*   **New Dynamics (t ≥ 0):** The magnetic field is abruptly switched to the +Y direction. The new Hamiltonian is `H_new = -μ · B = -γS_yB`. The system, which starts in the state `|+z⟩`, will now evolve according to this new Hamiltonian.\n\n*   **Time Evolution & Precession:** The initial state `|+z⟩` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H_new`. Therefore, the system will be in a non-stationary state, and the expectation values of observables that do not commute with `H_new` (like `S_z` and `S_x`) will evolve in time. This evolution is known as Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector, `⟨S⟩`, which is initially pointing along the +Z axis, will start to precess around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis).\n\n*   **Calculating the Frequency:** There are three common ways to calculate the frequency of this precession, all of which are used by the various agents and lead to the same result.\n\n    *   **Method 1: The Larmor Frequency.** Conceptually, the precession frequency of a magnetic moment `μ = γS` in a magnetic field `B` is given directly by the Larmor frequency, `ω = γ|B|`. Since the z-component of the spin is simply one projection of this precessing vector, it must oscillate at the same frequency. This is the most direct conceptual approach and gives the answer `γB`.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Heisenberg/Ehrenfest Equations of Motion.** By calculating the time evolution of the expectation value of the `S_z` operator, `d⟨S_z⟩/dt`, one gets a set of coupled differential equations for `⟨S_z⟩` and `⟨S_x⟩`. Solving this system yields a second-order differential equation for `⟨S_z⟩`:\n        `d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = -(γB)²⟨S_z⟩`.\n        This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `x'' = -ω²x`, from which we can directly identify the angular frequency of oscillation as `ω = γB`. This method is robust and used correctly by many agents.\n\n    *   **Method 3: Schrödinger Picture.** One can calculate the time-evolved state vector `|ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩`. The result is:\n        `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩`.\n        Then, one calculates the expectation value `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`. This gives:\n        `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`.\n        Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, this simplifies to:\n        `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n        The z-component of the spin (and thus the magnetic moment) oscillates as `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω = γB`. A common mistake is to see the `γBt/2` in the spinor and assume that is the oscillation frequency, but the observable quantity oscillates at twice that frequency.\n\n**2. Analysis of Candidate Answers**\n\n*   All 15 candidate answers correctly perform the physical derivation, arriving at the same result: the oscillation frequency is `γB`. This demonstrates a strong consensus on the physics.\n*   The discrepancies in the final selected letters (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`) are due to some agents re-ordering the options in their local reasoning process.\n*   The original question's options are:\n    A) `gamma*B`\n    B) `sqrt(2)*gamma*B`\n    C) `gamma*B/2`\n    D) `gamma*B/sqrt(2)`\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe unanimous conclusion from the physical analysis of all provided answers is that the oscillation frequency is `γB`. Matching this result to the question's list of options, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis is a classic quantum mechanics problem involving Larmor precession. All the provided answers, despite choosing different letters due to a randomization of options, arrive at the same correct physical conclusion. Here is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   **System:** A spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin angular momentum operator.\n*   **Initial Conditions:** The particle is in a uniform magnetic field `B_initial = B ẑ` (along the +Z direction). The phrase \"aligned with the magnetic field\" signifies that the particle is in its lowest possible energy state.\n*   **Initial Hamiltonian:** The energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is given by the Hamiltonian `H = -μ ⋅ B`. Therefore, the initial Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -γS ⋅ (B ẑ) = -γB S_z`.\n*   **Finding the Lowest Energy State:** The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue +ħ/2) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue -ħ/2). The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = +γB(ħ/2)`. Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is the spin-up state `|+z⟩`.\n*   **Conclusion:** The initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`. The expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` initially points along the +Z axis.\n\n### 2. Identifying the New Hamiltonian (t > 0)\n\n*   **The Change:** At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to point along the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new field is `B_new = B ŷ`.\n*   **The \"Sudden\" Approximation:** In quantum mechanics, a \"sudden\" change means the process is too fast for the state vector to change during the transition. Therefore, at the instant right after the switch (`t=0+`), the particle's state is still `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n*   **New Hamiltonian:** For all `t > 0`, the system's evolution is governed by the new Hamiltonian: `H = -μ ⋅ B_new = -γS ⋅ (B ŷ) = -γB S_y`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe initial state `|+z⟩` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H` (which depends on `S_y`), so the state will evolve in time. We want to find the oscillation frequency of `⟨μ_z(t)⟩`. This can be done in several ways.\n\n#### Method 1: Larmor Precession (Intuitive Approach)\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` follows the classical torque equation: `d⟨S⟩/dt = γ⟨S⟩ × B`.\n*   Initially, `⟨S⟩` points along the Z-axis.\n*   The new `B` field points along the Y-axis.\n*   The torque `γ⟨S⟩ × B` is initially along the `-X` direction (`Z × Y = -X`).\nThis torque causes the spin vector `⟨S⟩` to precess around the Y-axis. The frequency of this precession is a well-known result called the **Larmor frequency**, `ω_L = |γB|`.\nAs the spin vector rotates in the XZ-plane, its projection onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z⟩`, will oscillate with this same frequency. Since `⟨μ_z⟩` is just `γ⟨S_z⟩`, it also oscillates with the frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n#### Method 2: Heisenberg Equation of Motion (Formal Approach)\n\nWe can find the time evolution of the `S_z` operator.\n1.  `d<S_z>/dt = (1/iħ) <[S_z, H]> = (-γB/iħ) <[S_z, S_y]>`\n2.  Using the spin commutation relation `[S_y, S_z] = iħS_x`, we get `[S_z, S_y] = -iħS_x`.\n3.  Substituting this in gives: `d<S_z>/dt = (-γB/iħ) (-iħ<S_x>) = γB <S_x>`.\n4.  Similarly, we find `d<S_x>/dt = -γB <S_z>`.\n5.  Differentiating the first result and substituting the second gives:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB d<S_x>/dt = γB (-γB <S_z>) = -(γB)² <S_z>`\n6.  This is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`, with the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n#### Method 3: Full Time Evolution (Most Detailed)\n\nAs many of the provided answers show, we can evolve the state vector `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(iγBt S_y / ħ) |+z⟩` and then explicitly calculate `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)⟩`. This calculation yields:\n`⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`\nBy inspecting this result, we see that it is a cosine function of time. The general form is `A cos(ωt)`. Comparing the forms, the angular frequency `ω` is `γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll valid physical methods consistently show that the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. This is the Larmor frequency.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nThe correct answer is `gamma*B`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Physics Problem**: The core of the problem involves a spin-1/2 particle initially in its lowest energy state (spin-up, aligned with a magnetic field along +Z). This field is then suddenly switched to the +Y direction. We need to find the oscillation frequency of the z-component of its magnetic moment, `⟨μz⟩`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physical Principle**: This scenario is a classic example of **Larmor precession**. A magnetic moment `μ` (or its associated spin `S`) in a magnetic field `B` experiences a torque that causes its expectation value `⟨S⟩` to precess around the direction of `B`. The angular frequency of this precession is called the **Larmor frequency**, `ω_L`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Larmor Frequency**: The Larmor frequency is given by the formula `ω_L = |γB|`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `B` is the magnitude of the magnetic field. In this problem, the new magnetic field has magnitude `B`, so the precession frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Motion**:\n    *   The initial spin expectation value `⟨S(0)⟩` points along the +Z axis.\n    *   The new magnetic field `B` points along the +Y axis.\n    *   Therefore, the spin vector `⟨S⟩` will precess around the Y-axis.\n    *   As this vector rotates in the XZ-plane, its projection onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z(t)⟩`, will oscillate.\n    *   The frequency of this oscillation is identical to the precession frequency. Thus, the oscillation frequency of `⟨S_z(t)⟩`—and by extension, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩` since `μ_z = γS_z`—is `ω = γB`.\n\n5.  **Review the Candidate Answers' Reasoning**:\n    *   A vast majority of the provided answers (Answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) correctly identify the physics.\n    *   They employ several valid methods to prove the result:\n        *   **Heisenberg Picture**: Solving the operator equations of motion `d<S_k>/dt = (1/iħ) <[S_k, H]>`, which yields a simple harmonic oscillator equation for `⟨S_z⟩` with frequency `ω = γB` (e.g., Answers 5, 10).\n        *   **Schrödinger Picture**: Expressing the initial state `|+z⟩` in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian (`-γBS_y`), applying the time evolution operator, and calculating `⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`. This results in a term proportional to `cos(γBt)` (e.g., Answers 2, 4, 8, 12, 14).\n        *   **Bohr Frequency**: Noting that the initial state is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. The oscillation frequency is then `ω = ΔE/ħ`, which again yields `ω = γB` (e.g., Answers 2, 9, 15).\n        *   **Larmor Precession Concept**: Directly applying the concept of Larmor precession (e.g., Answers 1, 7, 13).\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Conclude**: All correct physical derivations unanimously conclude that the oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`. The disagreements in the final letter choices (e.g., `<<<A>>>`, `<<<B>>>`, `<<<C>>>`, `<<<D>>>`) seem to arise from inconsistent ordering of the options presented to each candidate. However, the derived physical quantity is consistently `γB`.\n\n7.  **Match with Final Options**: The question provides the following options:\n    A) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n    B) gamma*B/2\n    C) gamma*B\n    D) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe derived frequency `γB` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis is a classic problem of Larmor precession in quantum mechanics. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Physical Situation**\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):** The spin-1/2 particle is in a magnetic field `B` pointing in the `+Z` direction. The phrase \"aligned with a magnetic field\" means the particle is in its lowest energy eigenstate. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ · B = -γB S_z`. The energy levels are `E = -γB m_s ħ`, where `m_s` can be `+1/2` or `-1/2`. The lowest energy state corresponds to spin-up along the z-axis, `|+z⟩`, which is the eigenstate of `S_z` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`. So, at `t=0`, the state is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n2.  **Sudden Change (t = 0):** The Z-field is turned off and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the `+Y` direction. The \"sudden\" approximation in quantum mechanics implies that the state of the system does not change at the instant of the switch. The system's evolution for `t > 0` is now governed by the new Hamiltonian: `H = -μ · B' = -γB S_y`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution (t > 0):** The initial state `|+z⟩` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H = -γB S_y`. Therefore, the state will evolve in time, leading to an oscillation in the expectation values of observables that do not commute with `H`, such as `S_z`.\n\n### **Method 1: Larmor Precession**\n\nThis is the most direct physical picture. An initial spin vector `⟨S⟩` placed in a magnetic field `B'` will precess (rotate) around the direction of `B'` with an angular frequency `ω` known as the **Larmor frequency**.\n\n*   The Larmor frequency is given by `ω = |γB'|`. In this problem, the magnitude of the new field is `B`, so `ω = γB`.\n*   Initially, the spin points along the Z-axis: `⟨S(0)⟩` is in the `+z` direction.\n*   The new field `B'` is along the Y-axis.\n*   The spin vector `⟨S(t)⟩` will precess around the Y-axis. As it rotates in the XZ-plane, its projection onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z(t)⟩`, will oscillate between its maximum and minimum values.\n*   The frequency of this oscillation is the frequency of the precession itself, which is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n*   Since `⟨μ_z⟩ = γ⟨S_z⟩`, it oscillates with the same frequency.\n\n### **Method 2: Quantum Mechanical Calculation**\n\nWe can solve this rigorously using the equations of motion for the expectation values (Ehrenfest's theorem, which is equivalent to the Heisenberg picture for this case).\n\n1.  The time evolution of the expectation value of `S_z` is given by:\n    `d<S_z>/dt = (1/iħ) <[S_z, H]> = (1/iħ) <[S_z, -γB S_y]> = (-γB/iħ) <[S_z, S_y]>`\n    Using the spin commutation relation `[S_y, S_z] = iħS_x`, we get `[S_z, S_y] = -iħS_x`.\n    `d<S_z>/dt = (-γB/iħ) (-iħ<S_x>) = γB<S_x>`\n\n2.  This result depends on `<S_x>`, so we find its equation of motion as well:\n    `d<S_x>/dt = (1/iħ) <[S_x, H]> = (-γB/iħ) <[S_x, S_y]>`\n    Using the commutation relation `[S_x, S_y] = iħS_z`:\n    `d<S_x>/dt = (-γB/iħ) (iħ<S_z>) = -γB<S_z>`\n\n3.  We now have a system of two coupled differential equations. Differentiate the first equation with respect to time:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB d<S_x>/dt`\n    Substitute the second equation into this:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB (-γB<S_z>) = -(γB)² <S_z>`\n\n4.  This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`. By comparison, the angular frequency of oscillation `ω` is `γB`.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBoth the physical picture of Larmor precession and the rigorous quantum mechanical calculation show that the oscillation frequency is `γB`.

Analyze the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   **System Setup:** A spin-1/2 particle has a magnetic moment `μ` proportional to its spin `S`, given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   **Initial Field:** A magnetic field `B` is applied in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian (energy operator) is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γS ⋅ (0, 0, B) = -γBS_z`.\n*   **Initial State:** The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This implies the particle is in its lowest possible energy state.\n    *   The eigenstates of the `S_z` operator are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming `γ` is positive, the lowest energy is `E_up`, which corresponds to the `|+z⟩` state.\n    *   Therefore, the state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the System Dynamics (t > 0)\n\n*   **Sudden Change:** At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is applied in the +Y direction. The state vector `|ψ⟩` does not have time to change during this instantaneous switch, so at `t=0+` the state is still `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n*   **New Hamiltonian:** For all `t > 0`, the system evolves according to the new Hamiltonian `H' = -μ ⋅ B = -γS ⋅ (0, B, 0) = -γBS_y`.\n\n### 3. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\n\nWe need to find the frequency at which the expectation value `⟨μ_z(t)⟩` oscillates. Since `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩`, this is equivalent to finding the oscillation frequency of `⟨S_z(t)⟩`. All the provided correct solutions use one of three main methods to find this.\n\n#### Method 1: Larmor Precession (Semi-Classical Approach)\nThis is the most direct physical picture.\n*   The time evolution of the spin expectation value `⟨S⟩` follows the classical torque equation: `d⟨S⟩/dt = ⟨μ⟩ × B' = γ(⟨S⟩ × B')`.\n*   This equation describes the precession of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` around the new magnetic field `B'` (which is along the Y-axis).\n*   The angular frequency of this precession is the **Larmor frequency**, given by `ω = γB`.\n*   The initial spin vector `⟨S(0)⟩` points along the Z-axis. As it precesses around the Y-axis, it rotates in the XZ plane. Its projection onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z(t)⟩`, will therefore oscillate sinusoidally with the Larmor frequency.\n*   **Conclusion:** The oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n#### Method 2: Full Quantum Calculation (Schrödinger Picture)\n*   The state evolves as `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iH't/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩ = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ)|+z⟩`.\n*   Using matrix representations (`S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`), one can find the evolution operator `U(t)` and apply it to the initial state vector `|+z⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ`.\n*   This yields the state at time `t`: `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩`.\n*   Calculating the expectation value `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩` gives:\n    `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)[cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n*   Using the double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, this simplifies to:\n    `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n*   The z-component of the magnetic moment is `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`. This function oscillates with angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n#### Method 3: Bohr Frequency (Energy Eigenstates)\n*   The initial state `|+z⟩` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H' = -γBS_y`. It is a superposition of the eigenstates of `H'`, which are `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`.\n    *   `|+z⟩ = (1/√2) (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)`\n*   The system is in a superposition of two energy levels. The energy eigenvalues corresponding to `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩` are `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_- = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   An observable in a superposition of two energy states will oscillate with the Bohr frequency, `ω = ΔE/ħ`.\n*   `ΔE = E_- - E_+ = γBħ`.\n*   `ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\nAll valid physical reasoning points to the same result.

This is the Larmor frequency.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial State Analysis:** The problem describes a spin-1/2 particle whose magnetic moment `μ` is \"aligned\" with a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. The interaction Hamiltonian is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γS ⋅ B = -γBS_z`. \"Aligned\" implies the particle is in its lowest energy state. The eigenvalues of `-γBS_z` are `-γB(ħ/2)` (for the spin-up state `|+z>`) and `+γB(ħ/2)` (for the spin-down state `|-z>`). The lowest energy state is therefore `|+z>`, assuming `γ` is positive. So, at time `t=0`, the state of the system is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian and Dynamics:** At `t=0`, the field is suddenly switched to the `+Y` direction. The new Hamiltonian is `H' = -γBS_y`. Since the initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H'`, the state will evolve in time. This time evolution is known as Larmor precession.\n\n3.  **Core Physical Principle: Larmor Precession:** A magnetic moment (or the expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩`) in a magnetic field `B` experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the field. The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, given by `ω_L = |γB|`. In this case, the initial spin vector `⟨S⟩` points along the Z-axis, and the new magnetic field `B'` is along the Y-axis. The spin vector will therefore precess in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis.\n\n4.  **Deriving the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   As the `⟨S⟩` vector precesses in the X-Z plane, its projection onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z⟩`, will vary sinusoidally.\n    *   The angle of the `⟨S⟩` vector with respect to the Z-axis at time `t` will be `θ(t) = ω_L * t`.\n    *   The z-component will therefore be `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨S_z(0)⟩ * cos(ω_L * t) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The z-component of the magnetic moment is `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   This expression is a cosine function of time with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n5.  **Cross-Verification from Agent Analysis:** A vast majority of the provided answers (at least 13 out of 15) correctly derive this result, `ω = γB`, using various rigorous methods, including:\n    *   The Heisenberg picture (equations of motion for operators).\n    *   The Schrödinger picture (explicit time-evolution of the state vector).\n    *   The Bohr frequency condition (`ω = ΔE/ħ`).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** All correct physical derivations lead to the same conclusion: the oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`. The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers are due to either different option mappings or simple human error.\n\n7.  **Final Answer Selection:** Based on the universally derived physical result `γB` and the provided options:\n    A) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n    B) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n    C) gamma*B/2\n    D) gamma*B\n\n    The correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a standard problem in quantum mechanics concerning the time evolution of a spin-1/2 particle, a phenomenon known as Larmor precession. I will synthesize the arguments from the provided candidate answers to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial State (`t < 0`)**:\n    *   The system is a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment `μ = γS`.\n    *   It is in a magnetic field `B` pointing along the +Z direction (`B_vec = B * z_hat`).\n    *   The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ · B = -γB S_z`.\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned with the field.\" This implies the system is in its lowest energy state.\n    *   The energy eigenstates of `H_initial` are the spin-up `|+z>` (with `S_z` eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (with `S_z` eigenvalue `-ħ/2`) states.\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming the gyromagnetic ratio `γ` is positive, the lowest energy state is `E_up`. Thus, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. All candidate analyses correctly identify this as the starting point.\n\n2.  **Sudden Change and New Dynamics (`t ≥ 0`)**:\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction (`B'_vec = B * y_hat`).\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the system's time evolution is `H = -μ · B' = -γB S_y`.\n\n3.  **Determining the Oscillation Frequency**:\n    All candidate answers correctly identify that the problem is to find the angular frequency of the oscillation of the expectation value `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩`. They employ several valid methods, all leading to the same physical result.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Larmor Precession (Semi-classical)**: The expectation value of the spin vector, `⟨S⟩`, behaves like a classical magnetic moment. It experiences a torque from the new magnetic field (`B'`) which causes it to precess around the direction of `B'` (the Y-axis). The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, given by `ω = γB`. Since the Z-component of `⟨S⟩` is oscillating as the vector precesses, its frequency of oscillation is `γB`. This is shown correctly in answers 1, 3, 7, and 13.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Full Quantum Calculation (Schrödinger Picture)**: This involves calculating the state at a later time `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)>` and then finding the expectation value `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)>`. As shown in great detail in answers 2, 4, 8, 12, 13 and 14, this calculation leads to:\n        `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n        This expression describes an oscillation of the form `A*cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω` is clearly `γB`.\n\n    *   **Method 3: Bohr Frequency**: The initial state `|+z>` can be written as a superposition of the new energy eigenstates (which are the eigenstates of `S_y`, i.e., `|+y>` and `|-y>`). The energy difference between these states is `ΔE = γBħ`. An observable that is not conserved (like `S_z`) will oscillate with the Bohr frequency `ω = ΔE/ħ = γBħ/ħ = γB`. This elegant argument is used in answers 2, 9, and 15.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll physically sound methods of derivation unanimously conclude that the oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n\nNow, we match this result to the given options:\n\n*   A) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n*   B) gamma*B\n*   C) gamma*B/2\n*   D) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe derived frequency `γB` corresponds exactly to option B. While some of the candidate agents correctly derived the physics but made a clerical error in selecting the final letter, the physical reasoning is robust and points to a single answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a standard problem in quantum mechanics concerning Larmor precession. Here's a breakdown of the physics and the step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   A spin-1/2 particle has its magnetic moment `μ` \"aligned\" with a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. The Hamiltonian (energy operator) is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γB S_z`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S_z` is the z-component of the spin operator.\n    *   Being \"aligned\" means the particle is in its lowest energy eigenstate. The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin-up) and `-ħ/2` (spin-down). The corresponding energies are `E = -γB(±ħ/2)`. Assuming `γ` is positive, the lowest energy state is the one with the maximum spin projection, which is the spin-up state `|+z⟩`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`. The expectation value of the spin vector at this moment is purely in the z-direction: `⟨S⟩ = (0, 0, ħ/2)`.\n\n2.  **Sudden Change and New Dynamics (t > 0):**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is instantaneously switched to the `+Y` direction, so the new field is `B_new = B ĵ`.\n    *   The particle's state has no time to change during the switch. For `t > 0`, the state evolves under the new Hamiltonian: `H_new = -μ ⋅ B_new = -γB S_y`.\n    *   The initial state `|+z⟩` is not an eigenstate of `S_y`, so it will evolve over time.\n\n3.  **Larmor Precession:**\n    *   This situation leads to a phenomenon called Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector, `⟨S⟩`, behaves like a classical gyroscope. It will precess around the direction of the new magnetic field (the Y-axis).\n    *   The angular frequency of this precession is known as the **Larmor frequency**, which is given by the formula `ω = γB`.\n\n4.  **Oscillation of the Z-Component:**\n    *   The initial spin expectation vector `⟨S⟩` points along the Z-axis. As it precesses around the Y-axis, its tip traces a circle in the XZ-plane.\n    *   The projection of this rotating vector onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z(t)⟩`, will oscillate as the cosine of the angle of rotation. The angle of rotation at time `t` is `ωt = (γB)t`.\n    *   Thus, `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨S_z(0)⟩ * cos(γBt) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   From this expression, it is clear that the quantity oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll valid methods of analysis (including using the Schrödinger equation with time-evolution operators, or the Heisenberg equations of motion for the spin operators) converge on the same result. The oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency.\n\n*   **Larmor Frequency:** `ω = γB`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma\\*B/sqrt(2)\nB) gamma\\*B\nC) sqrt(2)\\*gamma\\*B\nD) gamma\\*B/2\n\nThe correct choice is B. The vast majority of the provided candidate solutions correctly derived this result through various rigorous methods, even though some made a mistake in selecting the final letter option. The physics is unambiguous.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis is a classic problem in quantum mechanics concerning Larmor precession. I will analyze the problem and the provided answers step by step.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physics Problem\n\n*   **Step 1: Initial State (t < 0)**\n    *   A spin-1/2 particle is in a magnetic field `B` pointing along the +Z axis.\n    *   The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ · B = -γS_z B`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field, meaning it is in its lowest energy eigenstate. The energy levels are `E = -γB m_s ħ`. Assuming the gyromagnetic ratio `γ` and field `B` are positive, the lowest energy corresponds to the largest spin projection, so the particle is in the spin-up state along Z.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n*   **Step 2: New Dynamics (t > 0)**\n    *   The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the system's time evolution is `H = -μ · B = -γS_y B`.\n    *   The initial state `|+z⟩` is not an eigenstate of this new Hamiltonian, so the state will evolve over time.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determining the Oscillation Frequency**\n    The question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is proportional to `⟨S_z(t)⟩`, and will have the same frequency.\n\n    There are multiple standard ways to solve this, as demonstrated by the candidate answers:\n\n    *   **Method A: Larmor Precession:** Classically, a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` precesses around the direction of `B` with an angular frequency `ω_L = γB`. Quantum mechanically, the *expectation value* of the spin `⟨S⟩` follows this same classical motion. Since the initial spin points along Z and the field is now along Y, `⟨S⟩` will precess in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis. The projection of this vector onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z(t)⟩`, will oscillate with the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. This is the most direct conceptual approach.\n\n    *   **Method B: Full Quantum Calculation (Schrödinger Picture):** One calculates the time evolution of the state `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩` and then computes `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`. As correctly shown in many of the candidate answers (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 12, 13, 14), this yields `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`. The oscillation is described by `cos(ωt)` where the angular frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\n    *   **Method C: Bohr Frequency:** The initial state `|+z⟩` is a superposition of the two eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian `H=-γBS_y`. These new eigenstates `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩` have an energy difference `ΔE = E_{-y} - E_{+y} = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`. The system will oscillate between the components of the superposition at the Bohr frequency `ω = ΔE/ħ = (γBħ)/ħ = γB`. This method is correctly applied in answers 2, 9, and 15.\n\n    *   **Method D: Heisenberg Picture:** One can look at the time evolution of the operators. As shown in answers 5 and 10, this leads to a pair of coupled differential equations for the expectation values, which resolve into the simple harmonic oscillator equation `d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = -(γB)²⟨S_z⟩`. This again shows the angular frequency of oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Candidate Answers\n\n*   **Reasoning Consistency:** Almost all candidate answers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) correctly apply one or more of the valid physical methods described above. Their step-by-step reasoning is sound and consistently concludes that the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n*   **Final Answer Inconsistency:** There is significant confusion among the candidates regarding which letter option corresponds to the correct answer `γB`. For example, Answers 6, 14, and 15 derive `γB` but select `<<<A>>>`, which is `gamma*B/sqrt(2)`. This is an internal contradiction. However, the *derivation* in these answers is still correct. The overwhelming consensus of the physical derivations is that the frequency is `γB`.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nAll valid physical and mathematical derivations point to a single result: the oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`. I will base my final decision on this solid conclusion from the physics, disregarding the clear errors in mapping the result to an option letter made by some agents.\n\nBased on the original question's options:\nA) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nThe correct value `γB` corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers and ensuring all key points are addressed.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Initial State (t < 0)**\n\n*   **The System:** We have a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin angular momentum is described by the vector operator **S** = (S_x, S_y, S_z).\n*   **Magnetic Moment:** The particle has a magnetic moment **μ** proportional to its spin, given by **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   **Initial Hamiltonian:** The particle is in a magnetic field **B**_initial = B**ẑ** (pointing along the +Z axis). The energy of the particle is given by the Hamiltonian H_initial = -**μ** ⋅ **B**_initial = -γ**S** ⋅ (B**ẑ**) = -γBS_z.\n*   **Identifying the State:** The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the system is in its lowest possible energy state.\n    *   The eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are the eigenstates of S_z, which are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue `m_s = +ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue `m_s = -ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energy levels are E = -γBm_sħ. Assuming γ and B are positive constants, the energy for the spin-up state is E_up = -γB(ħ/2), and for the spin-down state is E_down = +γB(ħ/2).\n    *   The lowest energy state is the spin-up state, `|+z⟩`.\n*   **Conclusion on Initial State:** At time t=0, the state of the particle is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n### **2. Analyze the System Dynamics (t > 0)**\n\n*   **Sudden Change:** At t=0, the magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched. The field along the Z-axis is removed, and a new field **B**_new = B**ŷ** (same magnitude, but along the +Y axis) is applied. \"Sudden\" means the state vector `|ψ⟩` does not have time to change, so at t=0+, the state is still `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n*   **New Hamiltonian:** For all time t > 0, the system evolves according to the new Hamiltonian, H = -**μ** ⋅ **B**_new = -γ**S** ⋅ (B**ŷ**) = -γBS_y.\n\n### **3. Determine the Oscillation Frequency**\n\nThe initial state `|+z⟩` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H = -γBS_y`. Therefore, the system is in a superposition of the new energy eigenstates, which will cause the expectation values of certain observables (like μ_z) to oscillate. We can find this frequency in several ways.\n\n#### **Method 1: Larmor Precession (Semi-classical View)**\n\nThis is the most direct and physically intuitive approach.\n1.  The expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` follows the classical equation of motion for a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field: d`⟨S⟩`/dt = **μ** × **B** = γ`⟨S⟩` × **B**.\n2.  This equation describes the precession of the vector `⟨S⟩` around the direction of the magnetic field **B** (in this case, the Y-axis).\n3.  The angular frequency of this precession is known as the **Larmor frequency**, `ω_L`. Its magnitude is given by `ω_L = |γB|`.\n4.  At t=0, the spin vector `⟨S(0)⟩` points along the Z-axis. For t>0, this vector begins to precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane.\n5.  As the vector rotates, its projection onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z(t)⟩`, oscillates between its maximum value (+ħ/2) and minimum value (-ħ/2). The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the precession frequency, `ω_L`.\n6.  Therefore, the oscillation frequency of `⟨S_z⟩`, and consequently of `⟨μ_z⟩ = γ⟨S_z⟩`, is `ω = γB`.\n\n#### **Method 2: Full Quantum Calculation (Schrödinger Picture)**\n\n1.  **Time-Evolved State:** The state at time `t` is `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩ = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ)|+z⟩`.\n2.  **Calculate Expectation Value:** We need `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)⟩`. Let `ω = γB`.\n    *   `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩ = ⟨+z| exp(-iωtS_y/ħ) S_z exp(iωtS_y/ħ) |+z⟩`.\n    *   The operator `exp(-iθS_n/ħ)` represents a rotation around the axis **n** by an angle θ. Our calculation shows the evolution of the S_z operator in the Heisenberg picture: `S_z(t) = S_z cos(ωt) - S_x sin(ωt)`.\n    *   Now, we take the expectation value in the initial state `|+z⟩`:\n        `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨+z| (S_z cos(ωt) - S_x sin(ωt)) |+z⟩`\n        `= cos(ωt)⟨+z|S_z|+z⟩ - sin(ωt)⟨+z|S_x|+z⟩`\n    *   We know `⟨+z|S_z|+z⟩ = ħ/2` and `⟨+z|S_x|+z⟩ = 0`.\n    *   Therefore, `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(ωt) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n3.  **Result:** The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`. This is a function that oscillates with angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n#### **Method 3: Bohr Frequency Condition**\n\n1.  The initial state `|+z⟩` is a superposition of the new energy eigenstates (`|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`). `|+z⟩ = (1/√2) (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)`.\n2.  The energy difference between these two states is `ΔE = E_{-y} - E_{+y} = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n3.  The frequency of oscillation for observables is given by the Bohr frequency condition: `ω = ΔE/ħ`.\n4.  `ω = (γBħ)/ħ = γB`.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll three methods consistently show that the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`, which is the Larmor frequency.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct answer is `gamma*B`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a classic problem of Larmor precession in quantum mechanics. Let's analyze it step-by-step, synthesizing the correct reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Initial State (t < 0)\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its magnetic moment `μ` is related to its spin `S` by the gyromagnetic ratio `γ`, such that `μ = γS`.\n*   Initially, a magnetic field of magnitude `B` is applied in the `+Z` direction. The Hamiltonian of the system is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(S_z)B`.\n*   The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This implies the system is in its lowest possible energy state. The eigenstates of `H_initial` are the same as for `S_z`: spin-up `|+z⟩` (with energy `E_up = -γBħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (with energy `E_down = +γBħ/2`).\n*   Assuming `γ` is positive, the lowest energy state is the spin-up state. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the New Hamiltonian for Time Evolution (t > 0)\n*   At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off and a new magnetic field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the `+Y` direction.\n*   The new Hamiltonian `H` governs the time evolution for `t > 0`. This Hamiltonian is `H = -μ ⋅ B_new = -γ(S_y)B`.\n*   The initial state `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩` is not an eigenstate of this new Hamiltonian, so the state will evolve over time.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Oscillation Frequency\nWe need to find the oscillation frequency of the expectation value `⟨μ_z(t)⟩`. This can be done in a few ways, all of which are demonstrated in the candidate answers and lead to the same result.\n\n**Method 1: Larmor Precession**\nThis is the most direct physical picture. The time evolution of the expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` follows the classical equation for a magnetic top:\n`d⟨S⟩/dt = γ⟨S⟩ × B`\n\n*   The initial spin expectation value is `⟨S(0)⟩ = ⟨+z|S|+z⟩`, which points purely along the Z-axis.\n*   The new magnetic field `B` is along the Y-axis.\n*   The equation describes a precession of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` around the magnetic field `B` (the Y-axis) with a constant angular frequency known as the **Larmor frequency**, `ω_L`.\n*   The Larmor frequency is given by `ω_L = γB`.\n*   As the spin vector `⟨S⟩` precesses in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z(t)⟩`, oscillates. The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the Larmor frequency.\n*   Since `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩`, the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates at the same frequency.\n*   Therefore, the oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\n**Method 2: Full Quantum Calculation (Schrödinger Picture)**\n1.  **Time-evolved State:** The state at time `t` is `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩ = exp(iγBS_y t/ħ) |+z⟩`.\n2.  **Calculation:** We can evaluate this using the matrix forms for the spin operators (the Pauli matrices). The state at time `t` becomes:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩`\n3.  **Expectation Value:** We then calculate the expectation value `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n    `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n4.  **Trigonometric Identity:** Using the identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, this simplifies to:\n    `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n5.  **Final Result:** `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    This function oscillates as `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n**Method 3: Bohr Frequency**\n1.  **Express Initial State:** Express the initial state `|+z⟩` in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian `H = -γBS_y`. The eigenstates are `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`. We find `|+z⟩ = (1/√2)(|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)`.\n2.  **Energy Difference:** The energy difference between the two populated states is `ΔE = E_{-y} - E_{+y} = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n3.  **Bohr Frequency:** Any observable that is not conserved (like `S_z` or `μ_z`) will oscillate with the Bohr frequency `ω = ΔE/ħ`.\n    `ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\nAll three methods unequivocally show that the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. This corresponds to option B. The candidate answers show strong consensus on the reasoning, although some have typos in their final letter choice due to variations in the provided option list. The correct physical answer is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem**\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):** The problem states that a spin-1/2 particle has its magnetic moment `μ` aligned with a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ · B = -γ(S_x, S_y, S_z) · (0, 0, B) = -γB S_z`. Being \"aligned\" means the system is in its lowest energy state. The energy levels are determined by the eigenvalues of `S_z`, which are `±ħ/2`. The energies are `E = -γB(m_sħ)`. To minimize energy (assuming `γ` is a positive constant), we need to maximize `m_s`, so the particle must be in the spin-up state along Z. Thus, the initial state vector at t=0 is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n2.  **Sudden Change and New Dynamics (t > 0):** At t=0, the magnetic field is abruptly switched to the +Y direction. The new field is `B_new = (0, B, 0)`. The Hamiltonian governing the time evolution for `t > 0` becomes `H_new = -μ · B_new = -γB S_y`. The state `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩` is not an eigenstate of this new Hamiltonian, so it will evolve over time.\n\n3.  **Larmor Precession:** The physical phenomenon described is Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩`, which initially points along the Z-axis, will precess around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis). The angular frequency of this precession is a well-known quantity called the Larmor frequency.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Frequency:** The Larmor frequency `ω_L` is given by the formula `ω_L = |γB|`. As the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis, its components in the X-Z plane oscillate. Specifically, the projection of the spinning vector onto the Z-axis, which is `⟨S_z(t)⟩`, will oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is exactly the Larmor frequency.\n\n5.  **Formal Derivation (Heisenberg Picture):** To confirm this, we can use the equations of motion for the expectation values:\n    *   `d⟨S_z⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨[S_z, H]⟩ = (1/iħ)⟨[S_z, -γBS_y]⟩ = (-γB/iħ)⟨[S_z, S_y]⟩`\n    *   Using the spin commutation relation `[S_y, S_z] = iħS_x`, we get `[S_z, S_y] = -iħS_x`.\n    *   `d⟨S_z⟩/dt = (-γB/iħ)(-iħ⟨S_x⟩) = γB⟨S_x⟩` (Equation 1)\n    *   Similarly, `d⟨S_x⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨[S_x, -γBS_y]⟩ = (-γB/iħ)⟨[S_x, S_y]⟩ = (-γB/iħ)(iħ⟨S_z⟩) = -γB⟨S_z⟩` (Equation 2)\n\n    To find the oscillation of `⟨S_z⟩`, we differentiate Equation 1 and substitute Equation 2:\n    *   `d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = γB * d⟨S_x⟩/dt`\n    *   `d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = γB * (-γB⟨S_z⟩) = -(γB)²⟨S_z⟩`\n\n    This is the classic equation for a simple harmonic oscillator `x'' = -ω²x`, where the angular frequency `ω` is clearly `γB`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The expectation value of the z-component of spin `⟨S_z(t)⟩` oscillates with an angular frequency of `γB`. Since the z-component of the magnetic moment is directly proportional to it (`⟨μ_z⟩ = γ⟨S_z⟩`), it oscillates with the same frequency.\n\n**Comparison with Provided Options**\n\n*   A) `sqrt(2)*gamma*B`\n*   B) `gamma*B/2`\n*   C) `gamma*B`\n*   D) `gamma*B/sqrt(2)`\n\nOur derived oscillation frequency is `γB`, which matches option C. The reasoning in almost all the candidate answers correctly arrives at `γB` as the Larmor frequency, even if some of them make an error in the final step of selecting the corresponding letter.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
