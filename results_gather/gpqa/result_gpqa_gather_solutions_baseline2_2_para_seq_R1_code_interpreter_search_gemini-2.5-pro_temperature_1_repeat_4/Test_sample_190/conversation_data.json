The goal is to verify each step and arrive at the correct final product.\n\n**Overall Analysis of Candidate Answers:**\nAll 15 candidate answers provide a detailed, step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence. A careful review reveals a strong consensus on the chemical transformations that occur at each step. The discrepancy in the final letter choices appears to be an artifact of how the options were labeled for each agent, as their textual reasoning consistently points to the same final chemical structure. My analysis will follow this consensus reasoning.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Starting material treated with Sodium Hydride (NaH) then Benzyl Bromide (BnBr).**\n    *   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a **Williamson Ether Synthesis**. NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is the alcohol's -OH proton (pKa ≈ 17) over the ketone's α-protons (pKa ≈ 20). The resulting alkoxide nucleophile then reacts with the electrophile benzyl bromide (BnBr) in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted to a benzyl ether (-CH₂OBn). This serves to \"protect\" the alcohol group from the reagents in subsequent steps.\n    *   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Consensus:** All candidates correctly identify this step.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and cat. HCl.**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is the standard formation of a **tosylhydrazone**. The ketone functional group reacts with the tosylhydrazide in an acid-catalyzed condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water.\n    *   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n    *   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n    *   **Consensus:** All candidates correctly identify this step.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), then aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is the **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi), which results in the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction is then quenched with a mild proton source (aq. NH₄Cl).\n    *   **Transformation:** The overall result is the replacement of the original ketone with a carbon-carbon double bond. The ketone is effectively deoxygenated to an alkene.\n    *   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, specifically 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (or its regioisomer, which doesn't affect the final outcome).\n    *   **Consensus:** All candidates correctly identify the core transformation of the Shapiro reaction.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is **catalytic hydrogenation**. This powerful reduction method affects multiple groups in Product 3.\n    *   **Transformations:**\n        1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds (in the cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced to single bonds. This converts the ring to cyclohexane and the side chain to an isopropyl group.\n        2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Critically, Pd/C and H₂ are standard reagents for cleaving benzyl ethers. The benzyl protecting group (-OBn) is removed, regenerating the original alcohol (-OH).\n    *   **Product 4:** Combining these effects, the molecule becomes a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, with their 1,3-relationship preserved.\n    *   **Consensus:** All candidates correctly identify both hydrogenation of the C=C bonds and hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether.\n\n**Conclusion and Final Answer Identification:**\n\nThe unanimous chemical reasoning leads to a final product with the structure of **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nNow, let's match this structure to the given options:\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This name exactly matches the derived final product.\n*   **B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This is the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This structure results from an incorrect reaction pathway for step 3.\n*   **D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This is an intermediate structure.\n\nBased on the sound and consistent chemical reasoning provided by all candidates, the final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the four-reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Starting Material: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.**\n    *   This is a six-membered ring (cyclohexane).\n    *   It has a ketone group (=O) at position 1.\n    *   It has a primary alcohol in a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) at position 3.\n    *   It has an alkene in an isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) at position 5.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Treatment with Sodium Hydride (NaH) followed by Benzyl Bromide (BnBr).**\n    *   This is a **Williamson ether synthesis**.\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that selectively deprotonates the most acidic proton. The hydroxyl proton of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 17) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 20).\n    *   The resulting alkoxide ion (-CH₂O⁻) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide, displacing the bromide ion to form an ether. This step protects the alcohol group.\n    *   **Product 1:** The hydroxymethyl group is converted to a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn). The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.**\n    *   This is the standard formation of a **tosylhydrazone** from a ketone.\n    *   The ketone's carbonyl group reacts with the tosylhydrazide in a condensation reaction, eliminating a water molecule.\n    *   **Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n\n4.  **Step 3: Treatment with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).**\n    *   This is the **Shapiro reaction**.\n    *   The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi), which generates a dianion. This dianion collapses by eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate, forming a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    *   The reaction is quenched with a proton source (aqueous NH₄Cl), which protonates the vinyllithium.\n    *   The net effect of the Shapiro reaction is the replacement of the original ketone with a carbon-carbon double bond (C=O → C=C).\n    *   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative containing the benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group. An example regioisomer would be 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n5.  **Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).**\n    *   This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction, which causes two key transformations on Product 3.\n    *   **a) Alkene Hydrogenation:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced (saturated) to single bonds. This converts the cyclohexene ring to a cyclohexane ring and the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group.\n    *   **b) Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd-C is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers (debenzylation). The benzyl protecting group is removed, regenerating the original alcohol. The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   **Product 4 (Final Product):** Combining these transformations, the final molecule has a saturated cyclohexane ring, an isopropyl group (from the original C5), and a hydroxymethyl group (from the original C3). The 1,3-relationship between these two substituents is maintained throughout the synthesis. The correct IUPAC name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nComparing this final structure with the given options:\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This name correctly describes the derived structure.\n*   **B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. It implies nucleophilic addition of butyl lithium and fails to account for hydrogenolysis.\n*   **C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This is an intermediate, not the final product of the full sequence.\n*   **D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. Hydrogenolysis is an expected reaction under these conditions.\n\nThe final product of the reaction sequence is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the four-reaction sequence to determine the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** The starting molecule possesses three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene. Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will selectively deprotonate the most acidic proton. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-21). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction (Williamson ether synthesis). This reaction converts the hydroxymethyl group into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn), effectively protecting the alcohol. The ketone and alkene groups are unaffected.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, a ketone.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction between a ketone and a hydrazine derivative. Under acidic catalysis, the ketone's carbonyl group reacts with the tosylhydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone, eliminating one molecule of water.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C1 is converted into a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs). The structure is the tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction (Deoxygenation/Elimination)**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents is used for the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi. The first deprotonates the -NHTs group, and the second deprotonates the less sterically hindered alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the C=N bond). The resulting dianion collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosylate group to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction is quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride, which protonates the vinyllithium. The net effect of this reaction is to replace the original ketone with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative containing the isopropenyl group and the benzyl ether protecting group. For example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, an alkene with a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation that induces two key transformations:\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** The hydrogen gas, catalyzed by Pd/C, reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to form a cyclohexane ring. The double bond in the isopropenyl side chain is reduced to form an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Benzyl Ether Hydrogenolysis:** Pd/C with H₂ is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers (a form of deprotection). The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is broken, regenerating the original alcohol (-CH₂OH) and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 4:** Applying these transformations to Product 3, the final molecule is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The relative 1,3-relationship of these groups on the ring is preserved throughout the synthesis.\n\n**Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\nThe final product is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3 relationship. This molecule is named **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's match this final structure with the given options:\n*   **A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** Incorrect. This is an intermediate structure that retains the tosylhydrazone group, which is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   **B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** Incorrect. This structure implies an incorrect reaction pathway where n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile, adding a butyl group. It also fails to account for the deprotection in Step 4.\n*   **C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** **Correct**. This name perfectly describes the final product derived from the complete reaction sequence.\n*   **D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** Incorrect. This would be the product if the final hydrogenolysis step (cleavage of the benzyl ether) did not occur. Standard H₂/Pd-C conditions would cause this cleavage.\n\nTherefore, the structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence, synthesizing the information from the provided candidate answers to arrive at the final, correct structure.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), then benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Process:** NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the primary alcohol. The resulting alkoxide ion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzyl bromide.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyl ether, effectively protecting the alcohol. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Conclusion:** All candidate answers agree on this initial step.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Process:** This is a standard condensation reaction where the ketone of Product 1 reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. A molecule of water is eliminated.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n*   **Conclusion:** All candidate answers correctly identify this reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Deoxygenation (Shapiro Reaction)**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Process:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi. This causes a series of deprotonations and eliminations, resulting in the formation of a vinyllithium intermediate after losing nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. The reaction is then quenched with the mild proton source, aqueous NH₄Cl.\n*   **Transformation:** The net result of the Shapiro reaction is the replacement of the original ketone functional group with a carbon-carbon double bond. The tosylhydrazone group is eliminated.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative containing the benzyl ether protecting group and the isopropenyl side chain. For example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Conclusion:** There is strong agreement among all candidate answers that this is a Shapiro reaction which eliminates the ketone group and forms an alkene.\n\n**Step 4: Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Process:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation that performs two key functions on Product 3:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced (saturated) to single bonds. This includes the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain. The ring becomes a cyclohexane, and the side chain becomes an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** These conditions are standard for cleaving benzyl ethers. The protecting group is removed, and the original alcohol is regenerated.\n*   **Transformation:** The entire molecule becomes saturated, and the alcohol is deprotected. The final molecule is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship (their relative positions are preserved from the starting material).\n*   **Product 4:** The final structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n*   **Conclusion:** All candidate answers unanimously agree on the outcome of this final step and the structure of the final product.\n\n**Final Answer Determination**\n\nBased on the consistent and correct reasoning across all provided analyses, the structure of Product 4 is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Now we match this chemical name to the given options:\n\nA) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide — Incorrect. This is an intermediate.\nB) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene — Incorrect. This is the product if the alcohol remains protected as a benzyl ether.\nC) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol — Incorrect. This structure arises from an incorrect reaction pathway.\nD) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol — Correct. This matches the final product derived from the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformations to determine the structure of the final product, based on a synthesis of the provided reasoning.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the Alcohol**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic functional group. The alcohol's proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH selectively deprotonates the hydroxyl group to form a sodium alkoxide. This nucleophilic alkoxide then attacks benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted to a benzyl ether (-CH₂OBn). This protects the alcohol from the reagents in subsequent steps.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Tosylhydrazone**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction where a ketone reacts with a hydrazine derivative. The ketone at C1 is converted into a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Deoxygenation of the Ketone (Shapiro Reaction)**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the conditions for the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi. This causes the elimination of the tosyl group and a molecule of stable nitrogen gas (N₂), forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous workup with NH₄Cl protonates the vinyllithium.\n*   **Transformation:** The net result is the replacement of the original ketone functional group with a carbon-carbon double bond. The ketone is effectively deoxygenated to an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation process that has two effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** The hydrogen reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. This saturates both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain, converting them to a cyclohexane ring and an isopropyl group, respectively.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** This is also the standard condition for cleaving a benzyl ether protecting group. The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is broken by hydrogen, regenerating the original alcohol.\n*   **Transformation:** The cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane, the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group, and the benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) becomes a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** The final molecule is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The 1,3-relationship between the points of attachment is preserved from the starting material.\n\n**Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\nThe final product is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\nLet's match this structure with the provided options:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. Results from an erroneous reaction pathway.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This name accurately describes the final product.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is an intermediate structure.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step, which is highly unlikely under these standard conditions.\n\nAll provided analyses unanimously conclude that the final product's structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), a ketone (C=O), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic functional group. The alcohol's proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). NaH will deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH₂O⁻Na⁺). This nucleophilic alkoxide then reacts with the electrophile, benzyl bromide, in a Williamson ether synthesis (Sₙ2 reaction) to form a benzyl ether. This step serves to \"protect\" the alcohol from later reaction steps.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 1):** A ketone.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) with a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone carbonyl group reacts with the tosylhydrazide under acidic catalysis to eliminate a molecule of water and form a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of product 1, with a C=N-NHTs group replacing the C=O group at position 1.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction (Ketone Elimination)**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 2):** A tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with a strong base (n-BuLi), which results in elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This process replaces the original ketone functional group with a carbon-carbon double bond in the ring. The aqueous ammonium chloride serves to quench the reaction and protonate the intermediate.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative with a benzyl ether and an isopropenyl group. For example, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 3):** An alkene with a benzyl ether protecting group.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This powerful reduction method performs two key transformations on Product 3:\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** The hydrogen gas adds across all carbon-carbon double bonds, saturating them. Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are reduced to single bonds. This converts the isopropenyl group into an isopropyl group and the cyclohexene ring into a cyclohexane ring.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** A standard and important function of H₂/Pd-C is the cleavage of benzyl ethers. This reaction, known as hydrogenolysis, removes the benzyl protecting group (Bn) and regenerates the original alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a saturated cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The original 1,3-relationship of these groups on the ring is maintained. The name of this molecule is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLet's evaluate the options against our final structure:\n\n*   **A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This structure retains the benzyl ether protecting group. It would be the product if only hydrogenation occurred but not hydrogenolysis. This is incorrect, as H₂/Pd-C typically cleaves benzyl ethers.\n*   **B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This name accurately describes the final product: a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship. This is the correct answer.\n*   **C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This structure retains the tosylhydrazone group. This is an incorrect intermediate that ignores the Shapiro reaction and deprotection steps.\n*   **D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This structure suggests that n-butyllithium acted as a nucleophile, which is incorrect for a Shapiro reaction. It also fails to account for the deprotection step.\n\nThe final product of the reaction sequence is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product. The reasoning is consistent across all the provided candidate answers, indicating a strong consensus.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Alcohol Protection.** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   **Analysis:** NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic functional group, which is the primary alcohol (-CH₂OH, pKa ≈ 17), in preference to the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). This forms a sodium alkoxide.\n    *   The resulting nucleophilic alkoxide then reacts with benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (Sₙ2 reaction) to form a benzyl ether. This step protects the alcohol.\n    *   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation.** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction between a ketone and a hydrazine derivative. The ketone is converted into a tosylhydrazone.\n    *   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The C=O group is now a C=N-NHTs group.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Shapiro Reaction.** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) quench.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The strong base (n-BuLi, two equivalents) deprotonates the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This forms a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous quench then protonates the vinyllithium.\n    *   **Result:** The entire tosylhydrazone functional group is replaced with a carbon-carbon double bond, effectively removing the original carbonyl oxygen.\n    *   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis.** Product 3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a powerful reduction step with two key effects:\n        1.  **Hydrogenation:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds (the one in the ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced (saturated) to single bonds. The cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n        2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** A standard and important reaction with H₂/Pd-C is the cleavage of benzyl ethers. The protecting group is removed, and the original alcohol is regenerated.\n    *   **Result:** All points of unsaturation are removed, and the alcohol is deprotected. The final molecule is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) and an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂] in a 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **Product 4:** The IUPAC name for this structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reaction steps lead to a final structure of (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the correct structure of product 4.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\nThe starting material has three main functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene (isopropenyl group). They are arranged on a cyclohexane ring with the alcohol and alkene in a 1,3-relationship (meta) to each other relative to the C1-C3 and C1-C5 positions.\n\n**Step 1: Williamson Ether Synthesis**\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), then benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is the alcohol's -OH proton (pKa ≈ 17). The resulting alkoxide is a nucleophile that attacks the benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a Williamson ether synthesis that protects the alcohol as a benzyl ether (-OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The ketone and alkene are unchanged.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is the standard formation of a tosylhydrazone from a ketone. The ketone group reacts with the hydrazide to form a C=N bond, with the elimination of water.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The C=O group is now C=N-NHTs.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Shapiro reaction, a method for converting a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene. Two equivalents of the strong base (n-BuLi) deprotonate the tosylhydrazone twice. This leads to an unstable intermediate that eliminates nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group to form a vinyllithium species. The quench with NH₄Cl protonates the vinyllithium.\n*   **Transformation:** The net result is the replacement of the original ketone functional group with a C=C double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. This molecule contains two C=C double bonds and a benzyl ether protecting group.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This powerful reduction system performs two types of transformations on Product 3:\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** The hydrogen gas adds across both carbon-carbon double bonds, reducing them to single bonds. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Benzyl Ether Hydrogenolysis:** The H₂/Pd-C also cleaves the benzyl ether protecting group. This reaction, known as hydrogenolysis, breaks the C-O bond of the benzyl ether, regenerating the original alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** All unsaturations and protecting groups are removed. The cyclohexane skeleton is substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, which maintain their original 1,3-relationship.\n*   **Final Structure Name:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Evaluating the Final Options:**\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. Results from assuming n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile, which is incorrect for a Shapiro reaction.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the structure after hydrogenation of the alkenes but *before* the cleavage of the benzyl ether protecting group. Pd/C with H₂ would cleave this ether.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure accounts for all transformations: ketone elimination via Shapiro reaction, hydrogenation of both alkenes, and hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This structure still contains the tosylhydrazone group, which is eliminated in Step 3.\n\nThe comprehensive analysis of all reaction steps leads to (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol as the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem describes a four-step organic synthesis. To determine the final product (Product 4), we must analyze each reaction step sequentially.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic functional group. The alcohol's proton (pKa ≈ 17) is more acidic than the ketone's α-protons (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH₂O⁻Na⁺). This nucleophilic alkoxide then attacks the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (an Sₙ2 reaction).\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group is protected as a benzyl ether. -CH₂OH → -CH₂OBn (where Bn is a benzyl group, -CH₂Ph).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (a ketone).\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction where a ketone reacts with a hydrazide derivative under acidic catalysis to form a hydrazone.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (a tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This set of conditions is for the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of the strong base (n-BuLi), which deprotonates the nitrogen and an alpha-carbon. This leads to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. Quenching with aqueous NH₄Cl protonates the vinyllithium.\n*   **Transformation:** The net result of the Shapiro reaction is the replacement of the original ketone with a carbon-carbon double bond (C=O → C=C).\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (containing two alkenes and a benzyl ether).\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is a powerful reduction step with two main effects:\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced (saturated) to single bonds. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Benzyl Ether Hydrogenolysis:** The H₂/Pd-C combination is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers (deprotection). The benzyloxymethyl group is reduced back to a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   **Transformation:** The cyclohexene ring is saturated, the isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group, and the benzyl ether is cleaved back to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** The final molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The 1,3-relationship between these substituents on the ring is maintained throughout the synthesis. The name of this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the product if the benzyl ether is not cleaved, but hydrogenolysis is expected under these conditions.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure results from an erroneous interpretation of the Shapiro reaction, where n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is an intermediate structure that retains the tosylhydrazone group.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure perfectly matches the final product of the reaction sequence, after reduction of both alkenes and hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the correct final product.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), a ketone (C=O), and an alkene (-C(CH₃)=CH₂).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic functional group. The alcohol's proton (pKa ≈ 17) is more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Thus, NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This nucleophilic alkoxide then attacks the electrophilic benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction, forming a benzyl ether. This step serves to protect the alcohol from later reaction steps.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is the standard procedure to convert a ketone into a tosylhydrazone. The ketone's carbonyl group condenses with the primary amine of the hydrazide, eliminating a molecule of water.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The C=O group is converted to a C=N-NHTs group.\n\n**Step 3: Ketone Elimination (Shapiro Reaction)**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with at least two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi). The base deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice, leading to an unstable intermediate that collapses by eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This forms a vinyllithium species. The aqueous ammonium chloride workup then protonates the vinyllithium. The net result is the replacement of the original ketone with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction, which will reduce multiple functional groups present in Product 3.\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** Both the carbon-carbon double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced (saturated) to single bonds. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Benzyl Ether Hydrogenolysis:** The H₂/Pd-C conditions are standard for cleaving benzyl ethers. The benzyl protecting group is removed via hydrogenolysis, regenerating the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4 (Final Product):** Combining these transformations, the final product is a fully saturated cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. Their relative 1,3-positions are maintained throughout the synthesis. The name of this structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This name and structure correctly represent the final product of the complete reaction sequence.\n*   **B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This is an intermediate, as the tosylhydrazone is eliminated in the Shapiro reaction (Step 3).\n*   **C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This structure would result from an incorrect reaction pathway, assuming n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile on the ketone.\n*   **D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This would be the product if the alkenes were hydrogenated but the benzyl ether was not cleaved. This is an incomplete reaction, as H₂/Pd-C is a standard reagent for cleaving benzyl ethers.\n\nThe chemical reasoning provided by all candidate answers correctly identifies the structure of the final product as (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** NaH is a strong base that selectively deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is on the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 17) over the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). This forms a sodium alkoxide. The nucleophilic alkoxide then attacks benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction, forming a benzyl ether. This protects the alcohol from subsequent reagents.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The hydroxyl group is now a benzyl ether (-CH₂OBn), while the ketone and alkene remain unchanged.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (a ketone).\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction where the ketone carbonyl group reacts with the primary amine of the hydrazide derivative to form a tosylhydrazone. The acid catalyzes the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n\n**Step 3: Ketone Removal (Shapiro Reaction)**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (a tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the conditions for the Shapiro reaction. The strong base n-BuLi deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice (at the N-H and an α-carbon). The resulting dianion collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The quench with aqueous ammonium chloride protonates this intermediate to yield an alkene. The net result is the replacement of the original ketone functionality with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative with a benzyl ether group and an isopropenyl group, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (containing two C=C bonds and a benzyl ether).\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This powerful catalytic hydrogenation setup performs two crucial transformations:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation:** It reduces (saturates) all carbon-carbon double bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring becomes a single bond, creating a cyclohexane ring. The double bond in the isopropenyl side chain is also reduced, creating an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** It cleaves the benzyl ether protecting group. The C-O bond of the ether is broken, regenerating the original alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations results in a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Their 1,3-relationship from the starting material is preserved.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe final product is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl substituent and a hydroxymethyl substituent in a 1,3-relationship.

This molecule contains a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic functional group. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n*   The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis.

The benzyl protecting group is removed, regenerating the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    *   **Product 4:** Combining these three transformations, the final molecule is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. These substituents maintain their original 1,3-relationship on the ring. The correct chemical name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\nAll the candidate analyses, despite minor differences in describing the mechanism of Step 3, correctly converge on the same final structure for Product 4. The task is to match this structure with the options provided in the question.\n\nThe derived final product is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options from the prompt:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol — Incorrect. This structure implies a wrong reaction pathway where n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile.\n*   B) **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol** — Correct. This name accurately describes the final product derived from the reaction sequence.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide — Incorrect. This is a tosylhydrazone, an intermediate that is consumed in Step 3.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene — Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved (de-protected) in Step 4, which is not what happens under standard H₂/Pd-C conditions.\n\nTherefore, the structure of product 4 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the four-step reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Williamson Ether Synthesis (Protection)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), and an alkene (-C(CH₃)=CH₂).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) and benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic functional group. The alcohol's proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). NaH will therefore deprotonate the hydroxyl group to form an alkoxide. This nucleophilic alkoxide then attacks the electrophilic benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction (Williamson ether synthesis).\n*   **Product 1:** The alcohol is protected as a benzyl ether. The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard condensation reaction where the ketone is converted into a tosylhydrazone. The ketone's carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with the hydrazide to form a C=N-NHTs group, with the elimination of water. This is the first step of the Shapiro reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction converts the tosylhydrazone into an alkene. The strong base n-BuLi removes two protons (one from the nitrogen and one from the carbon alpha to the original ketone). The resulting intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group to form a vinyllithium species. The addition of aqueous ammonium chloride quenches this intermediate, protonating it to form a stable alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The net result is the replacement of the original ketone with a carbon-carbon double bond in the ring. The structure is a cyclohexene derivative, such as 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis (Reduction and Deprotection)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a powerful reduction step that affects multiple parts of Product 3.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced (saturated) to single bonds. This includes the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain. The cyclohexene becomes a cyclohexane, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** These conditions are standard for cleaving benzyl ethers. The benzyl protecting group is removed, regenerating the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a fully saturated cyclohexane ring with two substituents: an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Their relative 1,3-positions on the ring are maintained throughout the synthesis. The name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMatching the final structure to the given options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This is an intermediate before the Shapiro reaction is completed.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether protecting group was not removed in the final step.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This structure implies an incorrect reaction pathway for n-BuLi (nucleophilic addition).\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This name accurately describes the final product resulting from the reduction of all alkenes and the cleavage of the benzyl ether.\n\nAll of the candidate analyses, despite having varied letterings for their final answer, correctly identified the chemical structure of the final product as (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the correct final product.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic functional group. The alcohol's proton (pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the ketone's α-protons (pKa ≈ 20). The resulting alkoxide acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted to a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction between the ketone of Product 1 and the hydrazine derivative. The ketone (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Deoxygenation (Shapiro Reaction)**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi), which results in the elimination of nitrogen gas and the tosyl group to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous workup protonates this intermediate.\n*   **Transformation:** The net result of the Shapiro reaction is the replacement of the original ketone with a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). The location of this new double bond is between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and one of the adjacent carbons (C2 or C6).\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, such as 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd-C is a powerful reduction method that affects two types of functional groups present in Product 3.\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced (saturated) to single bonds. This includes the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain.\n    2.  **Benzyl Ether Hydrogenolysis:** This reaction condition is also standard for cleaving benzyl ethers (a process called hydrogenolysis). The benzyl protecting group is removed, regenerating the original alcohol.\n*   **Transformation:** The cyclohexene ring becomes a saturated cyclohexane ring. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. The benzyloxymethyl group is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   **Final Product (Product 4):** The resulting molecule is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. These substituents maintain their original 1,3-relationship. The chemical name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the four-step reaction analysis, the final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. Comparing this with the provided options:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect.

This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved by hydrogenolysis in the final step.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identified the chemical reactions and converged on the same final structure.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the four-step reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** The starting material has three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene. Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that deprotonates the most acidic proton. The hydroxyl proton of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a Williamson ether synthesis that protects the alcohol as a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which contains a ketone group.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed condensation reaction. The ketone carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs), with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction (Deoxygenation)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the conditions for the Shapiro reaction. The strong base n-BuLi (used in excess, typically 2 equivalents) deprotonates the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of the highly stable nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This process forms a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction is quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride, which acts as a proton source to replace the lithium. The net result is the replacement of the original ketone functionality with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative with a benzyl ether protecting group and an isopropenyl side chain, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, which contains two C=C double bonds and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This powerful reduction step performs two key transformations:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation:** The hydrogen gas, in the presence of the Pd catalyst, reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. This saturates the double bond in the cyclohexene ring (forming a cyclohexane ring) and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain (forming an isopropyl group).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** This is the standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers. The benzyl protecting group is removed, regenerating the original alcohol functional group.\n*   **Product 4 (Final Product):** Combining these transformations, the final molecule is a saturated cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Their original 1,3-relationship is maintained. The correct IUPAC name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. Now, let's match this correct structure to the given options:\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This structure is incorrect because it is the product of hydrogenation but not hydrogenolysis; the benzyl ether protecting group remains.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure is incorrect as it results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction, where n-BuLi is presumed to act as a nucleophile.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This structure is incorrect as it is an intermediate that is consumed in Step 3.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This is the correct name for the final product derived from the complete four-step synthesis.\n\nThe consensus from the reasoning of all provided answers points to the same chemical structure. The variance in their final letter choices is due to the options being shuffled for each agent. Based on the options provided in the question prompt, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Under acidic catalysis, the ketone's carbonyl group reacts with the tosylhydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone, eliminating one molecule of water.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C1 is converted into a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs). The structure is the tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction (Deoxygenation/Elimination)**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents is used for the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi. The first deprotonates the -NHTs group, and the second deprotonates the less sterically hindered alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the C=N bond). The resulting dianion collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosylate group to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction is quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride, which protonates the vinyllithium. The net effect of this reaction is to replace the original ketone with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative containing the isopropenyl group and the benzyl ether protecting group. For example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, an alkene with a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation that induces two key transformations:\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** The hydrogen gas, catalyzed by Pd/C, reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to form a cyclohexane ring. The double bond in the isopropenyl side chain is reduced to form an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Benzyl Ether Hydrogenolysis:** Pd/C with H₂ is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers (a form of deprotection). The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is broken, regenerating the original alcohol (-CH₂OH) and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 4:** Applying these transformations to Product 3, the final molecule is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The relative 1,3-relationship of these groups on the ring is preserved throughout the synthesis.\n\n**Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\nThe final product is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3 relationship. This molecule is named **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's match this final structure with the given options:\n*   **A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** Incorrect. This is an intermediate structure that retains the tosylhydrazone group, which is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   **B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** Incorrect. This structure implies an incorrect reaction pathway where n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile, adding a butyl group. It also fails to account for the deprotection in Step 4.\n*   **C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** **Correct**. This name perfectly describes the final product derived from the complete reaction sequence.\n*   **D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** Incorrect. This would be the product if the final hydrogenolysis step (cleavage of the benzyl ether) did not occur. Standard H₂/Pd-C conditions would cause this cleavage.\n\nTherefore, the structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence, synthesizing the information from the provided candidate answers to arrive at the final, correct structure.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), then benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Process:** NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the primary alcohol. The resulting alkoxide ion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzyl bromide.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyl ether, effectively protecting the alcohol. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Conclusion:** All candidate answers agree on this initial step.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Process:** This is a standard condensation reaction where the ketone of Product 1 reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. A molecule of water is eliminated.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n*   **Conclusion:** All candidate answers correctly identify this reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Deoxygenation (Shapiro Reaction)**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Process:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi. This causes a series of deprotonations and eliminations, resulting in the formation of a vinyllithium intermediate after losing nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. The reaction is then quenched with the mild proton source, aqueous NH₄Cl.\n*   **Transformation:** The net result of the Shapiro reaction is the replacement of the original ketone functional group with a carbon-carbon double bond. The tosylhydrazone group is eliminated.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative containing the benzyl ether protecting group and the isopropenyl side chain. For example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Conclusion:** There is strong agreement among all candidate answers that this is a Shapiro reaction which eliminates the ketone group and forms an alkene.\n\n**Step 4: Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Process:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation that performs two key functions on Product 3:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced (saturated) to single bonds. This includes the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain. The ring becomes a cyclohexane, and the side chain becomes an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** These conditions are standard for cleaving benzyl ethers. The protecting group is removed, and the original alcohol is regenerated.\n*   **Transformation:** The entire molecule becomes saturated, and the alcohol is deprotected. The final molecule is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship (their relative positions are preserved from the starting material).\n*   **Product 4:** The final structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n*   **Conclusion:** All candidate answers unanimously agree on the outcome of this final step and the structure of the final product.\n\n**Final Answer Determination**\n\nBased on the consistent and correct reasoning across all provided analyses, the structure of Product 4 is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Now we match this chemical name to the given options:\n\nA) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide — Incorrect. This is an intermediate.\nB) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene — Incorrect. This is the product if the alcohol remains protected as a benzyl ether.\nC) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol — Incorrect. This structure arises from an incorrect reaction pathway.\nD) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol — Correct. This matches the final product derived from the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformations to determine the structure of the final product, based on a synthesis of the provided reasoning.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the Alcohol**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic functional group. The alcohol's proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH selectively deprotonates the hydroxyl group to form a sodium alkoxide. This nucleophilic alkoxide then attacks benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted to a benzyl ether (-CH₂OBn). This protects the alcohol from the reagents in subsequent steps.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Tosylhydrazone**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction where a ketone reacts with a hydrazine derivative. The ketone at C1 is converted into a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Deoxygenation of the Ketone (Shapiro Reaction)**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the conditions for the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi. This causes the elimination of the tosyl group and a molecule of stable nitrogen gas (N₂), forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous workup with NH₄Cl protonates the vinyllithium.\n*   **Transformation:** The net result is the replacement of the original ketone functional group with a carbon-carbon double bond. The ketone is effectively deoxygenated to an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation process that has two effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** The hydrogen reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. This saturates both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain, converting them to a cyclohexane ring and an isopropyl group, respectively.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** This is also the standard condition for cleaving a benzyl ether protecting group. The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is broken by hydrogen, regenerating the original alcohol.\n*   **Transformation:** The cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane, the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group, and the benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) becomes a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** The final molecule is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The 1,3-relationship between the points of attachment is preserved from the starting material.\n\n**Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\nThe final product is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\nLet's match this structure with the provided options:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. Results from an erroneous reaction pathway.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This name accurately describes the final product.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is an intermediate structure.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step, which is highly unlikely under these standard conditions.\n\nAll provided analyses unanimously conclude that the final product's structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), a ketone (C=O), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic functional group. The alcohol's proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). NaH will deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH₂O⁻Na⁺). This nucleophilic alkoxide then reacts with the electrophile, benzyl bromide, in a Williamson ether synthesis (Sₙ2 reaction) to form a benzyl ether. This step serves to \"protect\" the alcohol from later reaction steps.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 1):** A ketone.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) with a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone carbonyl group reacts with the tosylhydrazide under acidic catalysis to eliminate a molecule of water and form a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of product 1, with a C=N-NHTs group replacing the C=O group at position 1.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction (Ketone Elimination)**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 2):** A tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with a strong base (n-BuLi), which results in elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This process replaces the original ketone functional group with a carbon-carbon double bond in the ring. The aqueous ammonium chloride serves to quench the reaction and protonate the intermediate.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative with a benzyl ether and an isopropenyl group. For example, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 3):** An alkene with a benzyl ether protecting group.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This powerful reduction method performs two key transformations on Product 3:\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** The hydrogen gas adds across all carbon-carbon double bonds, saturating them. Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are reduced to single bonds. This converts the isopropenyl group into an isopropyl group and the cyclohexene ring into a cyclohexane ring.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** A standard and important function of H₂/Pd-C is the cleavage of benzyl ethers. This reaction, known as hydrogenolysis, removes the benzyl protecting group (Bn) and regenerates the original alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a saturated cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The original 1,3-relationship of these groups on the ring is maintained. The name of this molecule is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLet's evaluate the options against our final structure:\n\n*   **A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This structure retains the benzyl ether protecting group. It would be the product if only hydrogenation occurred but not hydrogenolysis. This is incorrect, as H₂/Pd-C typically cleaves benzyl ethers.\n*   **B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This name accurately describes the final product: a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship. This is the correct answer.\n*   **C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This structure retains the tosylhydrazone group. This is an incorrect intermediate that ignores the Shapiro reaction and deprotection steps.\n*   **D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This structure suggests that n-butyllithium acted as a nucleophile, which is incorrect for a Shapiro reaction. It also fails to account for the deprotection step.\n\nThe final product of the reaction sequence is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product. The reasoning is consistent across all the provided candidate answers, indicating a strong consensus.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Alcohol Protection.** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   **Analysis:** NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic functional group, which is the primary alcohol (-CH₂OH, pKa ≈ 17), in preference to the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). This forms a sodium alkoxide.\n    *   The resulting nucleophilic alkoxide then reacts with benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (Sₙ2 reaction) to form a benzyl ether. This step protects the alcohol.\n    *   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation.** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction between a ketone and a hydrazine derivative. The ketone is converted into a tosylhydrazone.\n    *   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The C=O group is now a C=N-NHTs group.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Shapiro Reaction.** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) quench.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The strong base (n-BuLi, two equivalents) deprotonates the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This forms a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous quench then protonates the vinyllithium.\n    *   **Result:** The entire tosylhydrazone functional group is replaced with a carbon-carbon double bond, effectively removing the original carbonyl oxygen.\n    *   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis.** Product 3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a powerful reduction step with two key effects:\n        1.  **Hydrogenation:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds (the one in the ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced (saturated) to single bonds. The cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n        2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** A standard and important reaction with H₂/Pd-C is the cleavage of benzyl ethers. The protecting group is removed, and the original alcohol is regenerated.\n    *   **Result:** All points of unsaturation are removed, and the alcohol is deprotected. The final molecule is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) and an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂] in a 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **Product 4:** The IUPAC name for this structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reaction steps lead to a final structure of (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the correct structure of product 4.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\nThe starting material has three main functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene (isopropenyl group). They are arranged on a cyclohexane ring with the alcohol and alkene in a 1,3-relationship (meta) to each other relative to the C1-C3 and C1-C5 positions.\n\n**Step 1: Williamson Ether Synthesis**\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), then benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is the alcohol's -OH proton (pKa ≈ 17). The resulting alkoxide is a nucleophile that attacks the benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a Williamson ether synthesis that protects the alcohol as a benzyl ether (-OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The ketone and alkene are unchanged.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is the standard formation of a tosylhydrazone from a ketone. The ketone group reacts with the hydrazide to form a C=N bond, with the elimination of water.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The C=O group is now C=N-NHTs.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Shapiro reaction, a method for converting a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene. Two equivalents of the strong base (n-BuLi) deprotonate the tosylhydrazone twice. This leads to an unstable intermediate that eliminates nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group to form a vinyllithium species. The quench with NH₄Cl protonates the vinyllithium.\n*   **Transformation:** The net result is the replacement of the original ketone functional group with a C=C double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. This molecule contains two C=C double bonds and a benzyl ether protecting group.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This powerful reduction system performs two types of transformations on Product 3:\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** The hydrogen gas adds across both carbon-carbon double bonds, reducing them to single bonds. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Benzyl Ether Hydrogenolysis:** The H₂/Pd-C also cleaves the benzyl ether protecting group. This reaction, known as hydrogenolysis, breaks the C-O bond of the benzyl ether, regenerating the original alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** All unsaturations and protecting groups are removed. The cyclohexane skeleton is substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, which maintain their original 1,3-relationship.\n*   **Final Structure Name:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Evaluating the Final Options:**\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. Results from assuming n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile, which is incorrect for a Shapiro reaction.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the structure after hydrogenation of the alkenes but *before* the cleavage of the benzyl ether protecting group. Pd/C with H₂ would cleave this ether.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure accounts for all transformations: ketone elimination via Shapiro reaction, hydrogenation of both alkenes, and hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This structure still contains the tosylhydrazone group, which is eliminated in Step 3.\n\nThe comprehensive analysis of all reaction steps leads to (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol as the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem describes a four-step organic synthesis. To determine the final product (Product 4), we must analyze each reaction step sequentially.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic functional group. The alcohol's proton (pKa ≈ 17) is more acidic than the ketone's α-protons (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH₂O⁻Na⁺). This nucleophilic alkoxide then attacks the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (an Sₙ2 reaction).\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group is protected as a benzyl ether. -CH₂OH → -CH₂OBn (where Bn is a benzyl group, -CH₂Ph).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (a ketone).\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction where a ketone reacts with a hydrazide derivative under acidic catalysis to form a hydrazone.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (a tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This set of conditions is for the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of the strong base (n-BuLi), which deprotonates the nitrogen and an alpha-carbon. This leads to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. Quenching with aqueous NH₄Cl protonates the vinyllithium.\n*   **Transformation:** The net result of the Shapiro reaction is the replacement of the original ketone with a carbon-carbon double bond (C=O → C=C).\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (containing two alkenes and a benzyl ether).\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is a powerful reduction step with two main effects:\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced (saturated) to single bonds. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Benzyl Ether Hydrogenolysis:** The H₂/Pd-C combination is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers (deprotection). The benzyloxymethyl group is reduced back to a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   **Transformation:** The cyclohexene ring is saturated, the isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group, and the benzyl ether is cleaved back to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** The final molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The 1,3-relationship between these substituents on the ring is maintained throughout the synthesis. The name of this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the product if the benzyl ether is not cleaved, but hydrogenolysis is expected under these conditions.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure results from an erroneous interpretation of the Shapiro reaction, where n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is an intermediate structure that retains the tosylhydrazone group.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure perfectly matches the final product of the reaction sequence, after reduction of both alkenes and hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the correct final product.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), a ketone (C=O), and an alkene (-C(CH₃)=CH₂).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic functional group. The alcohol's proton (pKa ≈ 17) is more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Thus, NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This nucleophilic alkoxide then attacks the electrophilic benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction, forming a benzyl ether. This step serves to protect the alcohol from later reaction steps.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is the standard procedure to convert a ketone into a tosylhydrazone. The ketone's carbonyl group condenses with the primary amine of the hydrazide, eliminating a molecule of water.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The C=O group is converted to a C=N-NHTs group.\n\n**Step 3: Ketone Elimination (Shapiro Reaction)**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with at least two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi). The base deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice, leading to an unstable intermediate that collapses by eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This forms a vinyllithium species. The aqueous ammonium chloride workup then protonates the vinyllithium. The net result is the replacement of the original ketone with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction, which will reduce multiple functional groups present in Product 3.\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** Both the carbon-carbon double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced (saturated) to single bonds. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Benzyl Ether Hydrogenolysis:** The H₂/Pd-C conditions are standard for cleaving benzyl ethers. The benzyl protecting group is removed via hydrogenolysis, regenerating the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4 (Final Product):** Combining these transformations, the final product is a fully saturated cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. Their relative 1,3-positions are maintained throughout the synthesis. The name of this structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This name and structure correctly represent the final product of the complete reaction sequence.\n*   **B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This is an intermediate, as the tosylhydrazone is eliminated in the Shapiro reaction (Step 3).\n*   **C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This structure would result from an incorrect reaction pathway, assuming n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile on the ketone.\n*   **D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This would be the product if the alkenes were hydrogenated but the benzyl ether was not cleaved. This is an incomplete reaction, as H₂/Pd-C is a standard reagent for cleaving benzyl ethers.\n\nThe chemical reasoning provided by all candidate answers correctly identifies the structure of the final product as (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection (Williamson Ether Synthesis)**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** NaH is a strong base that selectively deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is on the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 17) over the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). This forms a sodium alkoxide. The nucleophilic alkoxide then attacks benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction, forming a benzyl ether. This protects the alcohol from subsequent reagents.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The hydroxyl group is now a benzyl ether (-CH₂OBn), while the ketone and alkene remain unchanged.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (a ketone).\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction where the ketone carbonyl group reacts with the primary amine of the hydrazide derivative to form a tosylhydrazone. The acid catalyzes the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n\n**Step 3: Ketone Removal (Shapiro Reaction)**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (a tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the conditions for the Shapiro reaction. The strong base n-BuLi deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice (at the N-H and an α-carbon). The resulting dianion collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The quench with aqueous ammonium chloride protonates this intermediate to yield an alkene. The net result is the replacement of the original ketone functionality with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative with a benzyl ether group and an isopropenyl group, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (containing two C=C bonds and a benzyl ether).\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This powerful catalytic hydrogenation setup performs two crucial transformations:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation:** It reduces (saturates) all carbon-carbon double bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring becomes a single bond, creating a cyclohexane ring. The double bond in the isopropenyl side chain is also reduced, creating an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** It cleaves the benzyl ether protecting group. The C-O bond of the ether is broken, regenerating the original alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations results in a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Their 1,3-relationship from the starting material is preserved.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe final product is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl substituent and a hydroxymethyl substituent in a 1,3-relationship. The IUPAC name for this molecule is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nMatching this to the options:\nA) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This is an intermediate.\nB) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This results from a misunderstanding of the reaction sequence.\nC) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This is the product before the deprotection (hydrogenolysis) of the benzyl ether.\nD) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This structure accurately reflects the result of all four reaction steps.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a systematic analysis of the four-step organic synthesis reaction to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic functional group. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n*   The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This converts the hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) into a benzyl ether (-CH₂OBn, where Bn = benzyl group, -CH₂C₆H₅), protecting it from subsequent reactions.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard reaction where a ketone reacts with a hydrazine derivative. The acid catalyst facilitates the condensation of the ketone with the tosylhydrazide, eliminating a molecule of water.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction (Deoxygenation)**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with at least two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi). The base deprotonates the hydrazone nitrogen and then an alpha-carbon. The resulting intermediate collapses, eliminating highly stable nitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosyl derivative to form a vinyllithium species. Quenching with a proton source like aqueous NH₄Cl protonates the vinyllithium.\n*   The overall result is the replacement of the original ketone functionality with a carbon-carbon double bond, effectively deoxygenating the molecule at that position.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (The exact regiochemistry of the new double bond doesn't affect the final product since it will be removed).\n\n**Step 4: Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation that performs two crucial transformations on Product 3:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced (saturated) to single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced, forming a cyclohexane ring. The double bond in the isopropenyl side chain is reduced, converting it to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** These conditions are standard for cleaving benzyl ethers. The benzyl protecting group is removed, converting the benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final molecule is a fully saturated cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. Their 1,3-relationship is maintained throughout the reaction sequence. The name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nLet's match this final structure to the provided options:\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is a tosylhydrazone intermediate that is removed in Step 3.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This name accurately describes the final product after all four reaction steps.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies a completely different and incorrect reaction pathway for Step 3.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the product if the final hydrogenolysis step (cleavage of the benzyl ether) did not occur. H₂/Pd-C is a standard and effective reagent for this transformation.\n\nTherefore, the final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a systematic analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product, integrating the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one + NaH, then BnBr → Product 1**\n    *   **Starting Material Analysis:** The initial molecule has three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n    *   **Reagent Analysis:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton. The alcohol's proton (pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the ketone's α-protons (pKa ≈ 20). Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an alkylating agent.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis. The NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form an alkoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide to form a benzyl ether. This step serves to protect the alcohol.\n    *   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. All agents correctly identified this step.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 + TsNHNH₂, cat. HCl → Product 2**\n    *   **Reagent Analysis:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) reacts with ketones in the presence of an acid catalyst.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone group undergoes a condensation reaction with the hydrazide, eliminating water.\n    *   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1, where the C=O group at position 1 is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group. All agents correctly identified this transformation.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 + n-BuLi, then aq. NH₄Cl → Product 3**\n    *   **Reagent Analysis:** n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi) is a very strong base. The reaction is quenched with a mild proton source (aqueous ammonium chloride).\n    *   **Reaction:** These conditions are characteristic of the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of strong base, leading to the formation of a dianion which then collapses by eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosylate group to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The quench with NH₄Cl protonates the vinyllithium.\n    *   **Transformation:** The overall result is the replacement of the original ketone functional group with a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). The ketone is effectively removed.\n    *   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, such as 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. All agents who analyzed the reaction in detail correctly predicted this outcome.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 + Pd/C, H₂ → Product 4**\n    *   **Reagent Analysis:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas (H₂) is a powerful catalyst for catalytic hydrogenation.\n    *   **Reaction & Transformations:** This single step accomplishes three key transformations on Product 3:\n        1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation (Ring):** The C=C double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, saturating the ring to cyclohexane.\n        2.  **Alkene Hydrogenation (Side Chain):** The C=C double bond in the isopropenyl group is reduced, converting it to an isopropyl group.\n        3.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** These conditions are standard for cleaving benzyl ethers. The benzyl protecting group is removed, regenerating the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    *   **Product 4:** Combining these three transformations, the final molecule is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. These substituents maintain their original 1,3-relationship on the ring. The correct chemical name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\nAll the candidate analyses, despite minor differences in describing the mechanism of Step 3, correctly converge on the same final structure for Product 4. The task is to match this structure with the options provided in the question.\n\nThe derived final product is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options from the prompt:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol — Incorrect. This structure implies a wrong reaction pathway where n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile.\n*   B) **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol** — Correct.

This is a tosylhydrazone, an intermediate that is consumed in Step 3.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene — Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved (de-protected) in Step 4, which is not what happens under standard H₂/Pd-C conditions.\n\nTherefore, the structure of product 4 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the four-step reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Williamson Ether Synthesis (Protection)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), and an alkene (-C(CH₃)=CH₂).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) and benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic functional group. The alcohol's proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). NaH will therefore deprotonate the hydroxyl group to form an alkoxide. This nucleophilic alkoxide then attacks the electrophilic benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction (Williamson ether synthesis).\n*   **Product 1:** The alcohol is protected as a benzyl ether. The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard condensation reaction where the ketone is converted into a tosylhydrazone. The ketone's carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with the hydrazide to form a C=N-NHTs group, with the elimination of water. This is the first step of the Shapiro reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction converts the tosylhydrazone into an alkene. The strong base n-BuLi removes two protons (one from the nitrogen and one from the carbon alpha to the original ketone). The resulting intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group to form a vinyllithium species. The addition of aqueous ammonium chloride quenches this intermediate, protonating it to form a stable alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The net result is the replacement of the original ketone with a carbon-carbon double bond in the ring. The structure is a cyclohexene derivative, such as 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis (Reduction and Deprotection)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a powerful reduction step that affects multiple parts of Product 3.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced (saturated) to single bonds. This includes the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain. The cyclohexene becomes a cyclohexane, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** These conditions are standard for cleaving benzyl ethers. The benzyl protecting group is removed, regenerating the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a fully saturated cyclohexane ring with two substituents: an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.
