    "To determine the necessary Lorentz factor, we can use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\nThe fraction of particles, N/N₀, that survive after traveling a distance R is given by the exponential decay law:\n\nN/N₀ = exp( -t / τ_lab )\n\nWhere:\n*   `t` is the time of flight in the lab frame (t = R/v ≈ R/c for ultra-relativistic particles).\n*   `τ_lab` is the particle's mean lifetime as measured in the lab frame.\n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame is dilated due to relativistic effects and is related to the particle's proper lifetime (τ₀, its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nτ_lab = γ * τ₀\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, we get:\n\nN/N₀ = exp( -R / (c * γ * τ₀) )\n\nLet's analyze the two scenarios given in the problem.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₁): 20\n*   Survival fraction (N/N₀)₁: 1/3\n*   Detector radius (R): 30 m\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n1/3 = exp( -30 / (c * 20 * τ₀) )\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ₀)\n-ln(3) = -1.5 / (c * τ₀)\nln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ₀)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Survival fraction (N/N₀)₂: 2/3\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂).\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n2/3 = exp( -30 / (c * γ₂ * τ₀) )\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)\n-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)\nln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations. We can solve for γ₂ by first finding a value for the constant term `(c * τ₀)` from Scenario 1 and substituting it into the equation for Scenario 2.\n\nFrom Scenario 1:\nc * τ₀ = 1.5 / ln(3)\n\nSubstitute this into the equation for Scenario 2:\nln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * (1.5 / ln(3)))\nln(3/2) = (30 * ln(3)) / (1.5 * γ₂)\nln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\nNow, we solve for γ₂:\nγ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\nγ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986, ln(2) ≈ 0.6931):\nγ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / (1.0986 - 0.6931)\nγ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"
