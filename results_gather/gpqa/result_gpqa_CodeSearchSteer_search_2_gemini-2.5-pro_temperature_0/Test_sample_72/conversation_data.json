    "### Calculation of Relative Speed and Total Energy in a Relativistic System\n\nTo determine the correct option, we must calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system using the principles of special relativity.\n\n#### Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nThe formula for relativistic velocity addition when two objects are moving in the same direction is:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut (mass 2m), `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut (mass 3m), `v2 = 0.5c`\n\nPlugging the values into the formula:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nThus, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n#### Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula `E = γmc^2`, where `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`. The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts.\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut (E1):**\n*   Mass = `2m`\n*   Velocity `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ1`):\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Now, calculate the energy `E1`:\n    `E1 = γ1 * (2m) * c^2 = 1.25 * 2mc^2 = 2.5mc^2`\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut (E2):**\n*   Mass = `3m`\n*   Velocity `v2 = 0.5c`\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ2`):\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Now, calculate the energy `E2`:\n    `E2 = γ2 * (3m) * c^2 ≈ 1.1547 * 3mc^2 ≈ 3.464mc^2`\n\n**Total System Energy (E_total):**\n*   `E_total = E1 + E2`\n*   `E_total = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 = 5.964mc^2`\n\nThe total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc^2**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately `0.14c`, and the total energy of the system is `5.96 mc^2`. Comparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n*   B) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n*   C) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n*   D) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n\nThe values in option B match our calculations.\n\n<<<B>>>"
