    "The calculation I performed is a standard relativistic kinematics problem. The search results confirm my methodology and the expected results.\n\n-   **Conservation Laws**: The decay of a stationary particle into two products is governed by the conservation of energy and momentum. The products must have equal and opposite momenta.\n-   **Massless Neutrino Assumption**: For this type of problem, the neutrino mass is considered negligible (zero).\n-   **Energy Calculation**: The energy of the products can be calculated using the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino is equal to its momentum multiplied by c (KE_ν = pc). The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy (KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²).\n-   **Calculated Values**: My calculated values of KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV and KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV are confirmed by multiple sources. One source gives the muon kinetic energy as 4.13 MeV. Another provides values of 4.08 MeV and 29.65 MeV using slightly different rest masses. A third source explicitly gives the final answer for a problem with the same initial values as KE_μ = 4.1 MeV and E_ν = 29.8 MeV. Another source also confirms the muon kinetic energy is 4.12 MeV.\n\nThe steps and the final values are correct.\n\n1.  **Initial State**:\n    *   Particle: Positive Pion (π⁺)\n    *   Status: Stationary (at rest)\n    *   Total Initial Energy (E_i): Rest energy of the pion = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n    *   Total Initial Momentum (p_i): 0\n\n2.  **Final State**:\n    *   Particles: Positive Muon (μ⁺) + Muon Neutrino (ν)\n    *   Rest Energy of Muon (m_μc²): 105.7 MeV\n    *   Rest Energy of Neutrino (m_νc²): Assumed to be 0 MeV\n\n3.  **Conservation of Momentum**:\n    *   The final total momentum must be zero.\n    *   Therefore, the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude (p).\n    *   p_μ = p_ν = p\n\n4.  **Conservation of Energy**:\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n    *   Where E_μ is the total energy of the muon and E_ν is the total energy of the neutrino.\n\n5.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relations**:\n    *   For the muon: E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   For the massless neutrino: E_ν = pc\n\n6.  **Solving for Momentum (pc)**:\n    *   Substitute E_ν = pc into the energy conservation equation: m_πc² = E_μ + pc  =>  E_μ = m_πc² - pc\n    *   Substitute this expression for E_μ into its energy-momentum relation:\n        (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   Expand the left side: (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   Simplify: (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_μc²)²\n    *   Solve for pc: pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]\n    *   Plug in the values:\n        pc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n        pc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n        pc = 8315.67 / 279.2\n        pc ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n7.  **Calculating Kinetic Energies (KE)**:\n    *   **Neutrino (KE_ν)**: Since it's massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n        KE_ν = E_ν = pc ≈ 29.8 MeV\n    *   **Muon (KE_μ)**: The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy.\n        KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²\n        From energy conservation: E_μ = m_πc² - E_ν = 139.6 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 109.8 MeV\n        KE_μ = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.1 MeV\n        Alternatively, using the other calculation method:\n        KE_μ = m_πc² - m_μc² - pc = 139.6 - 105.7 - 29.8 = 4.1 MeV.\n        A more precise calculation gives 4.12 MeV.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies for the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν) are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. This matches option C.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nMy calculated values match option C. The search results confirm these values.\n\nFinal answer is C.\nTo find the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν), we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay is: π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\nGiven:\n*   Rest energy of π⁺ (m_πc²) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest energy of μ⁺ (m_μc²) = 105.7 MeV\n*   The π⁺ is stationary, so its initial momentum is 0.\n*   The muon neutrino (ν) is assumed to be massless, a standard approximation in such problems.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum**\nSince the initial pion is at rest, the total momentum before the decay is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this momentum 'p'.\n\np_μ = p_ν = p\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy**\nThe total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the stationary pion. The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\n\nE_initial = E_final\nm_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy Calculations**\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is related to its rest mass (m) and momentum (p) by the equation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n*   For the muon (μ⁺):\n    E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n*   For the massless neutrino (ν):\n    Its rest mass is 0, so its total energy is E_ν = pc. This energy is purely kinetic.\n\n**4. Solving for the Energies**\nFirst, we solve for the momentum 'p'.\nFrom the energy conservation equation, we can write the muon's energy as:\nE_μ = m_πc² - E_ν = m_πc² - pc\n\nNow, substitute this into the muon's energy-momentum equation:\n(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nExpand the left side:\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nThe (pc)² terms on both sides cancel out. Rearranging to solve for pc:\n2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²\npc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\npc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\npc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\npc = 8315.67 / 279.2\npc ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n**5. Calculating the Kinetic Energies (KE)**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy.\n    KE_ν = E_ν = pc ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\n    The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy (KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²).\n    We can find the muon's total energy from energy conservation:\n    E_μ = m_πc² - E_ν = 139.6 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 109.8 MeV\n    Now, calculate its kinetic energy:\n    KE_μ = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.1 MeV.\n\nA more precise calculation yields KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV.\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
