    "The analysis of the reaction between an epoxide and an organocuprate relies on well-established principles of organic chemistry. The reaction of an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), with an epoxide proceeds via a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) mechanism. This mechanism has specific consequences for both the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analysis of Reactants:**\n*   **Substrate:** The epoxide is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This name describes a cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide ring (forming the bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane core). The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6. There are methyl substituents at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me2CuLi, a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of the nucleophilic methyl anion (Me-).\n\n**2. Regioselectivity:**\nOrganocuprates are known to attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   In the given epoxide, the two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   C1 is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to the other ring carbons.\n*   C6 is a secondary carbon.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered **C6**.\n\n**3. Stereochemistry:**\nThe reaction proceeds through an SN2-type mechanism, which results in the inversion of configuration at the carbon atom being attacked.\n*   The nucleophile (Me-) attacks C6.\n*   The initial configuration at C6 is (S).\n*   Due to the inversion of configuration, the new stereocenter at this carbon in the product will be **(R)**.\n*   The configurations of the other chiral centers (C1, C3, and C4) are not involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps and thus remain unchanged as (1R, 3R, 4R).\n\n**4. Product Identification and Nomenclature:**\nThe attack of the methyl group on C6 opens the epoxide ring, and subsequent protonation (during workup) places a hydroxyl (-OH) group on C1. The resulting product is a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol. To name the product according to IUPAC rules:\n*   The carbon bearing the hydroxyl group receives the highest priority and is numbered C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the reactant.\n*   The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the new C1 towards the carbon that was attacked (the original C6) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   The name is therefore **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**5. Final Stereochemical Assignment:**\nCombining the stereochemical outcomes with the new IUPAC numbering:\n*   **New C1** (from original C1): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n*   **New C2** (from original C6): Configuration is inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n*   **New C4** (from original C4): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n*   **New C5** (from original C3): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n\nThus, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
