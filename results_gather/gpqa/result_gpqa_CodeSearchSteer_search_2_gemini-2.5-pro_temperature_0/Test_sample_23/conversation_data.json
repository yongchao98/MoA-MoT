    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer based on the provided chemical problem.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z\n\n1.  **Analyze the composition of Z**: The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n2.  **Determine the formula type**: The mass percentage 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n    *   For a general cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n, the mass fraction of hydrogen is (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7. This matches the given data.\n    *   For a general alkane with the formula CnH2n+2, the mass fraction of hydrogen would be (2n+2) / (14n+2). Setting this to 1/7 leads to 14n + 14 = 14n + 2, which is impossible.\n3.  **Conclusion for Z**: Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n. The problem also mentions it is a widely used solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n\n1.  **Properties of Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n2.  **Components of Y**: One component of Y is Z, which we identified as cyclohexane (C6H12).\n3.  **Hydrogenation of Y**: Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that all components of Y must have the same carbon skeleton. The other component must be a C6 compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n4.  **Identify the second component**: Since the second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is likely aromatic. Benzene (C6H6) is the aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton. Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions. Hydrogenation of benzene produces cyclohexane.\n5.  **Conclusion for Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X and the Reaction\n\n1.  **Properties of X**: Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds). The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n2.  **Hydrogenation of X**: Hydrogenation of mixture X also yields only Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that both components of X are C6 cyclic compounds.\n3.  **The Reaction (X → Y)**: Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation reaction, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer.\n    *   Let the two components of X be A and B.\n    *   The reaction is: A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6).\n4.  **Conservation of Atoms**: Since the reaction is a 1:1 transformation of an equimolar mixture, we can balance the atoms. Let A be C6Hx and B be C6Hy.\n    *   Carbon atoms are already balanced (6+6 → 6+6).\n    *   Hydrogen atoms must also be balanced: x + y = 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Structures of Components in X and Calculate the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Identify possible structures**: The components of X (A and B) must be unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons without conjugated bonds. The most common examples are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n2.  **Check for non-conjugated bonds**:\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) has one double bond, so there is no conjugation. This is a valid candidate.\n    *   Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) exists as two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem specifies no conjugated bonds, so the component must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n3.  **Solve for components**: We need two molecules whose hydrogen counts (x and y) sum to 18.\n    *   If we choose A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n4.  **Verify the reaction**: The proposed reaction is:\n    Cyclohexene (C6H10) + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n    This is a plausible hydrogen transfer reaction where 1,4-cyclohexadiene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and cyclohexene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane. Such disproportionation and hydrogen transfer reactions over platinum catalysts are well-documented.\n5.  **Calculate the final answer**: The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in Cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
