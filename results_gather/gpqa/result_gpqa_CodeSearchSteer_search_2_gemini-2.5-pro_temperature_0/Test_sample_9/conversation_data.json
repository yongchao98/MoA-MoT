    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, let's analyze each option based on the principles of planetary science.\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This describes a planet identical to Earth, which has an average density of approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as being about 5.5 g/cm³, which is very close to Earth's density.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets with the same composition, a more massive planet will have a stronger gravitational force. This increased gravity compresses the planet's material, leading to a higher overall density. A planet that is five times the mass of Earth, but made of the same \"stuff,\" will be significantly more compressed by its own gravity, and therefore, its density will be substantially greater than Earth's.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a planet with less mass will have weaker gravity and will therefore experience less gravitational compression. As a result, its density will be lower than that of Earth.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, the planet in option (c) will be the densest. Its significantly greater mass will cause a much higher degree of gravitational compression than the other planets, resulting in the highest density. The planets in options (a) and (b) have densities roughly equal to Earth's, while the planet in option (d) would be less dense.\n\n<<<B>>>"
