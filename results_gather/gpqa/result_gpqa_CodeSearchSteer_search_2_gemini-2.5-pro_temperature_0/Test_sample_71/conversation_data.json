    "The multi-step synthesis described is a method to generate and characterize a reactive diene, which is the final product 4. The overall process can be broken down into the following key transformations:\n\n1.  **Formation of a Reactive Diene:** 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is treated with sodium iodide at an elevated temperature. This reaction is a reductive dehalogenation that forms 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene (also known as 5,6-bis(methylene)cyclohexa-1,3-diene). This molecule is the species referred to as product 4.\n\n2.  **Trapping of the Diene (Formation of Product 1):** The highly reactive diene formed in situ is immediately trapped by 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene via a double Diels-Alder reaction. Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, two molecules of the diene add to the two double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative.\n\n3.  **Deprotection (Formation of Product 2):** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. The acid cleaves the tert-butyl ether, converting the tert-butoxy group into a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n4.  **Oxidation (Formation of Product 3):** The secondary alcohol in product 2 is oxidized to a ketone (C=O) using the Parikh-Doering oxidation (SO3/pyridine in DMSO).\n\n5.  **Release of the Final Product (Formation of Product 4):** Product 3 is heated to 150Â°C. This high temperature induces a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. This reaction is the reverse of the initial trapping step and releases the two molecules of the diene, 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. The other fragment, 7-ketonorbornadiene, is unstable and decomposes to form benzene and carbon monoxide.\n\nThe final product in question, **4**, is **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze its structure and symmetry.\n\nThe molecule consists of a six-membered cyclohexadiene ring with two exocyclic double bonds at positions 5 and 6. While it might appear planar, the cyclohexadiene ring adopts a twisted, non-planar conformation. This twisted structure possesses a C2 axis of symmetry, which passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n\nDue to this C2 symmetry:\n*   The hydrogen atoms at positions 1 and 4 are chemically equivalent.\n*   The hydrogen atoms at positions 2 and 3 are chemically equivalent.\n*   The two exocyclic methylene (=CH2) groups at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent.\n*   Within each methylene group, the two hydrogen atoms are in different chemical environments (they are diastereotopic) because of the ring's chirality. However, the C2 symmetry makes the \"outer\" protons of both methylene groups equivalent to each other, and the \"inner\" protons of both methylene groups equivalent to each other.\n\nThis results in four distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n1.  The two hydrogens at C1 and C4.\n2.  The two hydrogens at C2 and C3.\n3.  The two \"outer\" hydrogens on the exocyclic methylenes.\n4.  The two \"inner\" hydrogens on the exocyclic methylenes.\n\nTherefore, there are 4 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
