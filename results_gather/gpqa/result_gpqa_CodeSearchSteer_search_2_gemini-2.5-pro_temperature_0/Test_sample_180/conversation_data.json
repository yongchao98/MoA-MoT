    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the approximate ratio of the neutrino fluxes.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State of the Sun\n\nIn the Sun, energy is produced primarily through two sets of fusion reactions: the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO (Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen) cycle.\n\n*   **Proton-Proton (pp) Chain:** This is the dominant process in the Sun, responsible for about 99% of its energy output. It has several branches (pp-I, pp-II, pp-III).\n*   **CNO Cycle:** This process is secondary in the Sun, contributing only about 1% of its total energy. It is more significant in stars more massive than the Sun.\n\n### 2. Understand the Neutrino Sources in the Relevant Energy Bands\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of fluxes in two specific energy bands:\n*   **Band 1:** 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV)\n*   **Band 2:** 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV)\n\nLet's identify which reactions produce neutrinos in these bands:\n*   **Neutrinos from the pp-II branch:** The `7Be + e- → 7Li + νe` reaction produces mono-energetic (line) neutrinos, with the vast majority at **861 keV**. This line falls squarely within **Band 2**.\n*   **Neutrinos from the pp-III branch:** The `8B → 8Be* + e+ + νe` reaction produces a continuous spectrum of high-energy neutrinos (up to ~15 MeV). These neutrinos contribute to the flux in both Band 1 and Band 2.\n*   **Neutrinos from the CNO cycle:** The decays of `13N` and `15O` produce continuous spectra of neutrinos that also contribute to the flux in both Band 1 and Band 2.\n\n### 3. Apply the Hypothetical Change\n\nThe problem states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stops**. The key neutrino-producing reaction of the pp-III branch is the decay of Boron-8 (`8B`). Therefore, the consequences are:\n*   The flux of `8B` neutrinos disappears from the solar neutrino spectrum.\n*   All other reactions, including the entire pp-II branch and the CNO cycle, continue as they were. The prompt specifically notes that the pp-II branch is *not* stopped.\n\n### 4. Determine the Fluxes After the Change\n\nWith the `8B` neutrinos gone, let's re-evaluate the sources of flux in each band:\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** The only remaining sources of neutrinos in this energy range are the continuous spectra from the **CNO cycle** (`13N` and `15O` decays).\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** This band is now overwhelmingly dominated by the very strong, mono-energetic neutrino line at 861 keV from the **`7Be` reaction** (part of the pp-II branch). There is also a small contribution from the CNO cycle continuum.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Approximate Ratio\n\nThe question asks for the ratio: Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2).\n\nBased on our analysis, this ratio is approximately:\n**Ratio ≈ (Flux from CNO cycle in 700-800 keV) / (Flux from `7Be` line at 861 keV)**\n\nThis problem can be solved by recognizing what each energy band represents after the change.\n*   **Band 1's flux is a proxy for the CNO cycle's contribution.**\n*   **Band 2's flux is a proxy for the pp-chain's contribution** (specifically, the significant pp-II branch).\n\nIn the Sun, the CNO cycle is responsible for about 1% of the total energy generation, while the pp-chain accounts for the other 99%. The neutrino fluxes from these cycles are related to their energy output. Therefore, the ratio of the flux representing the CNO cycle to the flux representing the pp-chain should be on the order of 1:99.\n\nRatio ≈ (CNO cycle contribution) / (pp-chain contribution) ≈ 1% / 99% ≈ 0.01.\n\nThis value corresponds to 10⁻².\n\n<<<A>>>"
