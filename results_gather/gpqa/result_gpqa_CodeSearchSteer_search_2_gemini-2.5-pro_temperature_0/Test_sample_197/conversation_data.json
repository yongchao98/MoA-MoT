    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate its mole fraction (α₂) and then convert it to a percentage.\n\nThe formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes can be described by the following equilibria and their overall stability constants (β):\n\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺ ; β₁ = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ; β₂ = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ; β₃ = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co(II) ion and all its complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nThe mole fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, α₂, is given by the formula:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nThis can be expressed in terms of the stability constants and the free thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n\n1.  **State the given values:**\n    *   Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M (0.01 M)\n    *   Total thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   Stability constants: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16\n\n2.  **Approximate the free thiocyanate concentration:** Since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium, [SCN⁻], to be equal to its initial total concentration.\n    [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M\n\n3.  **Calculate the individual terms in the denominator of the mole fraction equation:**\n    *   1\n    *   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\n4.  **Sum the terms to find the value of the denominator:**\n    Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n5.  **Identify the numerator for α₂:** The numerator is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)₂] complex.\n    Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\n6.  **Calculate the mole fraction (α₂):**\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n7.  **Convert the mole fraction to a percentage:**\n    Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 0.16916 × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThe percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex in the solution is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
