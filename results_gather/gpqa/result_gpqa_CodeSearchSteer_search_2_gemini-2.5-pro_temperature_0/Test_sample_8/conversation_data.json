    "Here is a breakdown of the symmetry of each molecule:\n\n*   **A) Triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)₃):** The core B(O)₃ unit is trigonal planar. However, the isopropyl groups are not planar and their hydrogens prevent the existence of a horizontal mirror plane (σh). While it has a C₃ rotational axis, the lack of a σh plane means it does not belong to the C₃h point group.\n\n*   **B) Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:** This molecule is built on a triphenylene core. Triphenylene itself is a planar molecule with D₃h symmetry. The fused furan-dione rings maintain the planarity and the overall D₃h symmetry. A molecule with D₃h symmetry contains a C₃ axis, three C₂ axes perpendicular to it, and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). While it possesses the elements of C₃h symmetry, its full, highest-order point group is D₃h.\n\n*   **C) Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:** This molecule, also known as mellitic trianhydride, consists of three anhydride groups fused to a central benzene ring. The entire molecule is planar, meaning it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh). It possesses a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. However, it lacks the perpendicular C₂ axes that would elevate its symmetry to D₃h. Therefore, its point group is C₃h.\n\n*   **D) Quinuclidine (C₇H₁₃N):** This is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure. It has a C₃ rotational axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing carbon-hydrogen group. It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain this C₃ axis. It does not have a horizontal mirror plane. The combination of a C₃ axis and three σv planes places it in the C₃v point group.\n\nBased on this analysis, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is the molecule that belongs specifically to the C₃h point group.\n\n<<<C>>>"
