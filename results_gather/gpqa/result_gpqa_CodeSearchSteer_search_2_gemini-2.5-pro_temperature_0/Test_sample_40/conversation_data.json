    "To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we must use the relativistic formula for the addition of velocities. This is necessary because the classical addition of velocities is not valid at speeds approaching the speed of light.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The laboratory is the stationary frame of reference (let's call it S).\n    *   The moving glass is the moving frame of reference (let's call it S').\n\n2.  **Define the velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the moving frame (the glass) relative to the stationary frame (the laboratory) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light within the moving frame (the glass) is `u'`. In a medium with an index of refraction `n`, the speed of light is `c/n`. Since the problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum `c` is equal to 1, the speed of light in the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities in the same direction in special relativity is:\n    `u = (v + u') / (1 + v*u'/c^2)`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the light as seen by the observer in the laboratory.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the glass.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of light in the glass (`1/n`).\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum (which is 1 in this problem).\n\n4.  **Substitute the values into the formula:**\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v*(1/n)/1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n    `u = n * (v + 1/n) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n*v + 1) / (n + v)`\n\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result corresponds to the formula derived by Max von Laue in 1907, which explained the results of the Fizeau experiment as a natural consequence of the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\nB) 1\nC) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nD) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\nThe calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
