    "The search results confirm the formulas I used.\n\n1.  **Transit Probability**: For a planet in a circular orbit, the geometric transit probability is approximately the ratio of the stellar radius (R_s) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a). This is stated as `ptrans ≈ RS / a`.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law**: The relationship between the orbital period (P), semi-major axis (a), and the mass of the central body (M) is given by `T² = (4π² / GM) * a³`. This can be rearranged to show the proportionality I used: `a ∝ (M * P²)^(1/3)`.\n\nThe initial reasoning and calculation steps are validated by these fundamental principles.\n\n**Summary of the derivation:**\n\n*   Transit probability for Planet 1: `p_1 ∝ R_s1 / a_1`\n*   Transit probability for Planet 2: `p_2 ∝ R_s2 / a_2`\n*   Ratio of probabilities: `p_1 / p_2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a_2 / a_1)`\n\n*   From Kepler's Third Law, the semi-major axis `a` is proportional to `(M_s * P²)^(1/3)`.\n*   Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is: `a_2 / a_1 = [(M_s2 * P_2²) / (M_s1 * P_1²)]^(1/3)`\n\n*   Substituting this into the probability ratio: `p_1 / p_2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * [(M_s2 * P_2²) / (M_s1 * P_1²)]^(1/3)`\n\n**Plugging in the given values:**\n\n*   `R_s1 = R_s2`  => `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`\n*   `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` => `M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2`\n*   `P_2 = 3 * P_1` => `P_2² / P_1² = 9`\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n\n*   `p_1 / p_2 = 1 * [ (1/2) * 9 ]^(1/3)`\n*   `p_1 / p_2 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n*   `p_1 / p_2 ≈ 1.65`\n\nThe probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1. This matches option B.\n\nFinal check of the question and options.\n- A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n- B) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit. (Correct)\n- C) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n- D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n\nThe conclusion is robust.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to compare the geometric transit probabilities of Planet_1 and Planet_2. The probability of a planet transiting its star, assuming a circular orbit, is given by the ratio of the star's radius (R*) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a).\n\nThe formula for transit probability (p) is:\np ≈ R* / a\n\nLet's denote the parameters for Planet_1 with a subscript 1 and for Planet_2 with a subscript 2.\n*   p₁ ≈ R*₁ / a₁\n*   p₂ ≈ R*₂ / a₂\n\nTo find which planet is more likely to transit, we need to calculate the ratio p₁ / p₂.\np₁ / p₂ = (R*₁ / a₁) / (R*₂ / a₂) = (R*₁ / R*₂) * (a₂ / a₁)\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that the host stars have the same radii:\n*   R*₁ = R*₂\n*   Therefore, R*₁ / R*₂ = 1.\n\nNow the ratio of probabilities simplifies to the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes:\np₁ / p₂ = a₂ / a₁\n\nTo find the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion, which relates the orbital period (P), the semi-major axis (a), and the mass of the host star (M*). The law can be expressed as:\nP² ∝ a³ / M*\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, a:\na³ ∝ P² * M*\na ∝ (P² * M*)^(1/3)\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [(P₂² * M*₂) / (P₁² * M*₁)]^(1/3)\n\nWe are given the following relationships from the problem description:\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2: P₂ = 3 * P₁. This means (P₂/P₁)² = 3² = 9.\n*   The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2: M*₁ = 2 * M*₂. This means M*₂ / M*₁ = 1/2.\n\nNow, we substitute these values back into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [9 * (1/2)]^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\nFinally, we find the ratio of the transit probabilities:\np₁ / p₂ = a₂ / a₁ = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the cube root of 4.5:\n(4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096\n\nSo, the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n*   B) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit. (Correct)\n*   C) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n*   D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n<<<B>>>"
