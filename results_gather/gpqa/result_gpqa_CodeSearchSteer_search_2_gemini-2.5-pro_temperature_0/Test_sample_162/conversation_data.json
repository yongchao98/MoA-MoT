    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**Part 1: Calculate the minimum volume of strong acid needed**\n\n1.  **Write the balanced chemical equation for the dissolution.**\n    Iron(III) hydroxide, a base, reacts with a strong acid (providing H⁺ ions) in a neutralization reaction:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃.**\n    First, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Molar mass of Fe ≈ 55.845 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 15.999 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of H ≈ 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n\n    Now, calculate the moles from the given mass:\n    Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n\n3.  **Determine the moles of H⁺ required.**\n    From the stoichiometry of the balanced equation, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺.\n    Moles of H⁺ = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.00280725 mol.\n\n4.  **Calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid.**\n    The \"minimum volume\" required is the stoichiometric amount needed to completely react with all the Fe(OH)₃.\n    Volume = Moles / Concentration\n    Volume of acid = 0.00280725 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0280725 L.\n\n5.  **Convert the volume to cm³.**\n    Volume in cm³ = 0.0280725 L * 1000 cm³/L ≈ 28.07 cm³.\n\n    This calculated volume is extremely close to the 28.05 cm³ given in option B. The minor difference is likely due to rounding of atomic masses used in the original problem.\n\n**Part 2: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution**\n\n1.  **Determine the composition of the final solution.**\n    After reacting 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ with 28.05 cm³ of 0.1 M acid, the strong acid is completely consumed. The resulting 100 cm³ solution contains the product, Fe³⁺ ions.\n    Moles of Fe³⁺ formed = Moles of Fe(OH)₃ dissolved ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n    Concentration of Fe³⁺ = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00093575 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.00936 M.\n\n2.  **Consider the hydrolysis of the Fe³⁺ ion.**\n    The iron(III) ion is a small, highly charged metal ion that acts as a weak acid in water by hydrolyzing it:\n    [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)\n    For simplicity, this is often written as:\n    Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH from hydrolysis.**\n    The pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of H⁺ (or H₃O⁺) produced in this equilibrium. This requires the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for the hydrated Fe³⁺ ion. Literature values for Ka at 25°C are typically in the range of 6 x 10⁻³ to 8 x 10⁻³.\n    Let's set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:\n    *   Initial [Fe³⁺] = 0.00936 M\n    *   Initial [H⁺] ≈ 0\n    *   At equilibrium, [H⁺] = x\n\n    The Ka expression is: Ka = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺] / [Fe³⁺] = x² / (0.00936 - x)\n    Using a representative Ka value of 6.3 x 10⁻³, we can solve for x:\n    6.3 x 10⁻³ = x² / (0.00936 - x)\n    Solving the quadratic equation gives x = [H⁺] ≈ 0.00515 M.\n    pH = -log(0.00515) ≈ 2.29.\n\n4.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    Our calculated volume (28.07 cm³) matches option B (28.05 cm³).\n    Our calculated pH (~2.3) is reasonably close to the pH in option B (2.04). The discrepancy is likely due to the specific Ka value(s) assumed by the problem, which might also account for the second hydrolysis step, making the solution more acidic (lower pH). The pH values in the other options are not consistent with the chemical principles. For instance, the pH in option A (2.69) is too high to allow for the complete dissolution of 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n\nTherefore, the pair of values in option B is the most chemically consistent answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
