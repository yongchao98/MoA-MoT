    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Compound (C8H9NO)**\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the initial reactant from its molecular formula and 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 5. This is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a -CH2- group.\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region are a classic pattern for a 1,4- (or para-) disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons in this region, combined with the reaction conditions (diazotization), points to a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This doublet for two protons is consistent with a -CH2- group adjacent to a single proton (-CH). This fits perfectly with the -CH2-CHO fragment, where this -CH2- is coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Starting Material:** Assembling these fragments—a para-substituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group—leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, undergoes a three-step reaction.\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O**\n    *   The first reagent, NaNO2 and HCl, is used for diazotization, which converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n    *   The subsequent addition of water (H₂O) and warming hydrolyzes the diazonium salt, replacing the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    *   The reaction proceeds in two stages: an initial aldol addition followed by dehydration.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-hydrogen (from the -CH2- group) of one aldehyde molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (structure corresponding to option C).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon and a hydrogen on the α-carbon are removed, forming a double bond. This results in a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl group.\n    *   The final product after dehydration is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Final Product Identification**\n\nComparing the derived final product with the given options:\n\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This matches the structure of the final aldol condensation product.\n*   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which would dehydrate upon heating.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents and structure.\n\nThe reaction conditions, particularly the application of heat, drive the reaction to completion to form the more stable, dehydrated condensation product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
