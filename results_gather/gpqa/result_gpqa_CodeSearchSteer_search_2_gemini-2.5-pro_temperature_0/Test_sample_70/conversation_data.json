    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the principles of planetary equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a perfect black body heated only by its parent star. The formula is derived from the balance between the energy absorbed from the star and the energy radiated by the planet. The equilibrium temperature is proportional to the inverse square root of the planet's distance from its star (a).\n\nT_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2)\n\nFor two planets, Planet_4 and Planet_2, orbiting the same star, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures can be expressed as:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a₂ / a₄)^(1/2)\n\nThis formula assumes both planets have the same Bond albedo, which is given in the problem.\n\n### 2. Kepler's Third Law\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star, this relationship can be written as:\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes of two planets can be related to the ratio of their orbital periods:\n\n(a₂ / a₄)³ = (P₂ / P₄)²\na₂ / a₄ = (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3)\n\n### 3. Calculation\n\nWe can now substitute the expression for the ratio of the semi-major axes (from Kepler's Law) into the equation for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = [(P₂ / P₄)^(2/3)]^(1/2)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the five planets as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. From this, we can identify the relative periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n*   P₂ = 2\n*   P₄ = 3.5\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of their periods:\n\nP₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5 = 20 / 35 = 4 / 7\n\nFinally, we substitute this value back into our temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.83\n\nThus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<C>>>"
