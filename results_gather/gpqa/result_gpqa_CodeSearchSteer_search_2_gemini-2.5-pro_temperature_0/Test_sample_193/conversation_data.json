    "To find the partition function Z for the given system of three spins, we must sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible microstates of the system. Here, β = 1/(kT), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.\n\nThe system consists of three spins (S1, S2, S3), each capable of taking values +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible configurations (microstates). The energy of the system is defined by the equation E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\nWe will now systematically list all 8 microstates, calculate the energy for each, and then group them by energy level to find the degeneracy of each level.\n\n**1. Calculation of Energy for Each Microstate:**\n\n*   **State 1:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n*   **State 2:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n*   **State 3:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1)\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = J\n*   **State 4:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1)\n    E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = J\n*   **State 5:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1)\n    E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = J\n*   **State 6:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1)\n    E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = J\n*   **State 7:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1)\n    E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = J\n*   **State 8:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1)\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = J\n\n**2. Determination of Energy Levels and Degeneracies:**\n\nFrom the calculations above, we can identify two distinct energy levels. The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of microstates that have that particular energy.\n\n*   **Energy Level E₁ = -3J:**\n    This energy level corresponds to two microstates: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    Therefore, the degeneracy g(E₁) is 2.\n*   **Energy Level E₂ = J:**\n    This energy level corresponds to the remaining six microstates.\n    Therefore, the degeneracy g(E₂) is 6.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Partition Function (Z):**\n\nThe partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all microstates, which can be expressed as the sum over the energy levels multiplied by their degeneracies.\n\nZ = Σᵢ g(Eᵢ) * e^(-βEᵢ)\n\nSubstituting the energy levels and their degeneracies:\n\nZ = g(E₁) * e^(-βE₁) + g(E₂) * e^(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
