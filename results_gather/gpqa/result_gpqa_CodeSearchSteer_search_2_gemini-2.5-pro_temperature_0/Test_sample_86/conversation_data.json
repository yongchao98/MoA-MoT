    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Compound's Description:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** The base structure is a benzene ring with two substituents (C₆H₄).\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl functional group.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** A halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) is directly bonded to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   Based on the criteria, one substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain two carbons and a carbonyl group. The most common and stable group fitting this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Combining these gives the molecular formula C₈H₇XO and the structure of a haloacetophenone.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Substitution Pattern and Predict the NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The problem describes a di-substituted ring. The relative positions of the two substituents (ortho, meta, or para) will determine the pattern of the signals in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Para (1,4) substitution:** This arrangement is symmetrical. It would produce two distinct signals for the aromatic protons, with each signal integrating to 2 protons (2H). Due to coupling with adjacent protons, these signals would appear as doublets.\n    *   **Ortho (1,2) substitution:** This arrangement is asymmetrical and would result in four separate signals for the four aromatic protons, each integrating to 1H with more complex splitting.\n    *   **Meta (1,3) substitution:** This is also an asymmetrical arrangement that would produce four distinct 1H signals in the aromatic region.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given NMR Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. While a structure like p-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde has 8 carbons and a carbonyl, the halogen is not directly attached to the aromatic ring, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), so it cannot represent the described aromatic compound.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This option also lacks the characteristic signals for a di-substituted benzene ring and is therefore incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** The two doublets at 7.8 ppm (2H) and 7.6 ppm (2H) are a classic sign of a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** The singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H is characteristic of the methyl protons in an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This spectrum perfectly matches the structure of a para-haloacetophenone (p-X-C₆H₄-COCH₃). For instance, the reported spectrum for 4-Bromoacetophenone is: δ 7.82 (d, 2H), 7.61(d, 2H), 2.57 (s, 3H). Similarly, the spectrum for 4-Chloroacetophenone is: δ 7.91 (d, 2H), 7.45 (d, 2H), 2.61 (s, 3H). The data in option D is highly consistent with these known compounds.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the NMR data in option D is the only one that correctly represents a di-substituted aromatic ring with 8 total carbons, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n<<<D>>>"
