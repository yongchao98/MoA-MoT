    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction series to identify the final product E and determine the number of signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 ---> A**\n\nPropionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) reacts with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT, HSCH2CH2SH) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (BF3) to form a 1,3-dithiane, which serves as a protecting group for the aldehyde.\n\n*   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane\n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi ---> B**\n\nButyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in compound A. The proton at the C2 position of the 1,3-dithiane ring (the carbon between the two sulfur atoms) is acidic and is removed by BuLi.\n\n*   **Product B:** 2-lithio-2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane ---> C**\n\nThe lithiated dithiane (B) is a strong nucleophile and reacts with bromoethane via an SN2 reaction. The ethyl group from bromoethane replaces the lithium atom.\n\n*   **Product C:** 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane\n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ ---> D**\n\nThis reaction is the deprotection of the dithiane group to regenerate a carbonyl group. Mercuric chloride (HgCl2) is used to hydrolyze the thioacetal.\n\n*   **Product D:** 3-Pentanone (CH3CH2COCH2CH3)\n\n**Step 5: D + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi ---> E**\n\nThis is a Wittig reaction, which converts a ketone into an alkene.\nFirst, the Wittig reagent is formed from 3-bromopentane and triphenylphosphine (PPh3), followed by deprotonation with BuLi.\n*   **Ylide formation:** PPh3 + CH3CH2CH(Br)CH2CH3 → [Ph3P-CH(CH2CH3)2]+Br-\n    [Ph3P-CH(CH2CH3)2]+Br- + BuLi → Ph3P=C(CH2CH3)2\nThe ylide, pentan-3-ylidene(triphenyl)phosphorane, then reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone). The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the carbon group of the ylide.\n*   **Wittig reaction:** (CH3CH2)2C=O + Ph3P=C(CH2CH3)2 → (CH3CH2)2C=C(CH2CH3)2 + Ph3PO\n\n*   **Product E:** 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene\n\n**13C-NMR Analysis of Product E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene)**\n\nThe structure of the final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, is symmetrical.\n(CH3-CH2-)2C=C(-CH2-CH3)2\n\nDue to the plane of symmetry through the double bond, we only need to consider one half of the molecule.\n1.  The **methyl carbons** (CH3) are equivalent. (1 signal)\n2.  The **methylene carbons** (CH2) of the ethyl groups are equivalent. (1 signal)\n3.  The **sp2 hybridized carbons** of the double bond are equivalent. (1 signal)\n\nTherefore, the final product E will show a total of **3** signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
