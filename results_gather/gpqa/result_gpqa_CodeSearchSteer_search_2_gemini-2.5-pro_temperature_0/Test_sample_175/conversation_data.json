    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Normalize the Initial State Vector**\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]`.\nFirst, we need to normalize this state vector. The squared norm is:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\nThe normalization constant is `1/√6`.\nThe normalized state vector is:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`\n\n**2. Find the Eigenvector of Operator P for the Eigenvalue 0**\n\nThe operator P is given by the matrix:\n`P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\nWe need to find the eigenvector `|v_P=0⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`. The eigenvalue equation is `P|v⟩ = λ|v⟩`. For `λ = 0`, we have `P|v⟩ = 0`.\nLet `|v⟩ = [x, y, z]`.\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z] = [0, 0, 0]`\nThis gives the system of equations:\n1.  `y/√2 = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n\nThe eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]`. To normalize it, we set `x² + 0² + (-x)² = 1`, which gives `2x² = 1`, so `x = 1/√2`.\nThe normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0 is:\n`|v_P=0⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]`\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability of Measuring P = 0**\n\nThe probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 for P is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the normalized initial state onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n`Prob(P=0) = |⟨v_P=0|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n`⟨v_P=0|ψ_norm⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2] . (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`\n`= (1/√12) * [(1)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1)*(1)]`\n`= (1/√12) * (-1 - 1) = -2/√12 = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3`\n`Prob(P=0) = (-1/√3)² = 1/3`\n\n**4. Determine the State After Measuring P = 0**\n\nAfter the measurement of P yields the value 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector:\n`|ψ'⟩ = |v_P=0⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]`\n\n**5. Find the Eigenvector of Operator Q for the Eigenvalue -1**\n\nThe operator Q is given by the matrix:\n`Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\nSince Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1), and the corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\nThe eigenvector for the eigenvalue `λ = -1` is:\n`|v_Q=-1⟩ = [0, 0, 1]`\n\n**6. Calculate the Probability of Measuring Q = -1**\n\nNow, we measure the observable Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`. The probability of getting the result -1 is:\n`Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |⟨v_Q=-1|ψ'⟩|²`\n`⟨v_Q=-1|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] . [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]`\n`= (0)*(1/√2) + (0)*(0) + (1)*(-1/√2) = -1/√2`\n`Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = (-1/√2)² = 1/2`\n\n**7. Calculate the Joint Probability**\n\nThe probability of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the steps above.\n`Prob(P=0 and Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)`\n`= (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\n<<<B>>>"
