    "Based on electrochemical principles and data, the correct completion of the statement is:\n\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\n*   **Thermodynamics:** The strength of an oxidizing agent is measured by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive potential indicates a stronger oxidant.\n    *   In an acidic solution, the reduction of oxygen has a standard potential of +1.23 V (O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O).\n    *   In a basic solution, the reduction of oxygen has a standard potential of +0.40 V (O₂ + 2H₂O + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻).\n    *   Since +0.40 V is less positive than +1.23 V, oxygen is thermodynamically a weaker oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions.\n\n*   **Kinetics:** The speed of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is known to be slow. However, the reaction is even more sluggish in acidic environments than in alkaline (basic) ones. This is a major challenge in the development of fuel cells that operate in acidic conditions. Studies have shown that ORR activity is higher in alkaline media. Therefore, oxygen reacts kinetically slower in acidic solutions.\n\nCombining these two points, the correct pairing is \"weaker\" and \"slower\".\n\n<<<C>>>"
