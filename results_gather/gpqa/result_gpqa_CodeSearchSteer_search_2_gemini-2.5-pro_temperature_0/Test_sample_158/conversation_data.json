    "The problem requires us to first determine the redshift of the quasar from the provided spectral information and then use this redshift along with the given cosmological parameters to calculate its comoving distance.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Redshift (z)\n\nThe spectrum of the quasar shows a peak at a wavelength of 790 nm, with a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths. This feature is characteristic of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line, which is a key indicator for determining the redshift of distant objects. The rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line, which is the wavelength measured in a laboratory, is approximately 121.6 nm (or 1215.67 angstroms).\n\nThe redshift (z) is calculated by the formula:\nz = (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1\n\nGiven:\n*   Observed wavelength (λ_obs) = 790 nm\n*   Rest wavelength (λ_rest) = 121.6 nm\n\nCalculation:\nz = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1\nz ≈ 6.497 - 1\nz ≈ 5.5\n\nSo, the redshift of the quasar is approximately 5.5.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Comoving Distance\n\nThe comoving distance is a measure of distance that accounts for the expansion of the universe. It can be calculated using the given cosmological parameters within the framework of the Lambda-CDM model.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n*   Hubble constant (H₀) = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   Matter density parameter (Ωₘ) = 0.3\n*   Dark energy density parameter (ΩΛ) = 0.7\n*   The universe is flat (implying the curvature density parameter Ωₖ = 0), which is consistent with Ωₘ + ΩΛ = 1.\n\nThe comoving distance (D_C) is calculated by integrating the following equation from the present (z=0) to the redshift of the object (z=5.5):\n\nD_C = (c/H₀) * ∫ [from 0 to z] dz' / E(z')\n\nwhere c is the speed of light and E(z) for a flat universe is given by:\n\nE(z) = sqrt(Ωₘ(1+z)³ + ΩΛ)\n\nUsing an online cosmological calculator with the values z = 5.5, H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹, Ωₘ = 0.3, and ΩΛ = 0.7, the comoving distance is found to be approximately 8036 Mpc, which is equivalent to 8.036 Gpc.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated comoving distance of approximately 8 Gpc matches one of the given options.\n\n<<<D>>>"
