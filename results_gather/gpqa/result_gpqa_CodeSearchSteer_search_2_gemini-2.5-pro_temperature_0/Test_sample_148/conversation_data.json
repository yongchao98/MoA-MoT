    "Here's a breakdown of the analytical data and what it implies:\n\n*   **Â¹H NMR Data:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is correct (1H). Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this indicates the proton exists in two different chemical environments. The roughly equal integrals suggest the two species are present in a nearly 1:1 ratio.\n*   **LC-MS Data:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates the crude material into two distinct peaks of equal intensity, confirming the presence of two different species in a 1:1 ratio. The mass spectrometry (MS) shows that both of these separated peaks have the identical mass, which matches the expected product.\n\n### Analysis of the Options:\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereomers are expected to have different NMR spectra. It is very common for corresponding protons in a pair of diastereomers to appear as separate peaks.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Their different physical properties allow them to be separated by standard chromatography techniques like LC. Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and therefore the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data.\n    *   **Plausibility:** This scenario is highly plausible in peptide synthesis. Epimerization (inversion of a chiral center) at an alpha-carbon is a known side reaction, which would produce a diastereomer. Another common source is the *cis-trans* isomerization of the peptide bond preceding a proline residue; these *cis* and *trans* isomers are a form of diastereomer called rotamers or atropisomers and are known to be slow to interconvert on the NMR timescale, resulting in two sets of peaks.\n\n*   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis would have a different molecular structure and, crucially, a different molecular weight. The MS data, which shows both peaks have the same mass as the final product, rules out this possibility.\n\n*   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This describes a side product with a different chemical structure and a higher molecular weight than the target peptide. As with option B, this is inconsistent with the MS data showing both peaks have the same mass as the expected product.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **NMR:** Standard NMR spectroscopy is an achiral technique and cannot distinguish between enantiomers. A mixture of enantiomers would produce a single set of peaks, not two.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Standard LC columns are also achiral and cannot separate enantiomers; they would elute as a single peak.\n    *   This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe only explanation that fits all the experimental observations is that the compound is a mixture of diastereomers. They are distinct enough to be separated by LC and to show separate peaks in the NMR spectrum, but as isomers, they have the identical mass.\n\n<<<A>>>"
