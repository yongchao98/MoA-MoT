    "A dominant-negative mutation produces a mutant protein that not only is non-functional itself but also interferes with the function of the wild-type protein produced from the other allele. This problem describes a transcription factor that must form a dimer to function. The mutation (Y) is in the dimerization domain.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the molecular events and the resulting phenotype:\n*   **The \"Poison Pill\" Dimer**: The mutant protein (Y) is still able to dimerize with the wild-type (WT) protein. However, the resulting WT-Y heterodimer is inactive. This \"poisons\" the wild-type protein, preventing it from carrying out its normal function.\n*   **Loss of Wild-Type Function**: Because the mutant Y protein sequesters the WT protein into non-functional dimers, it causes a loss-of-function of the protein produced by the wild-type allele. If the cell produces equal amounts of WT and Y proteins, they will randomly form dimers in a 1:2:1 ratio of WT-WT, WT-Y, and Y-Y. Only the WT-WT dimers (25% of the total) will be functional, leading to a significant loss-of-function phenotype. This is a more severe outcome than a simple loss-of-function allele, which would be expected to leave 50% of the protein functional.\n*   **Evaluating the Options**:\n    *   A) A dominant-negative effect results in a loss-of-function, not a gain-of-function.\n    *   B) While protein aggregation can be a mechanism for some dominant-negative effects, the classic mechanism for dimerizing proteins is the formation of inactive heterodimers, which is a more direct consequence of a mutation in the dimerization domain.\n    *   C) If the mutation prevented dimerization altogether, the mutant protein would not interfere with the wild-type protein. The wild-type proteins could still form functional dimers, likely resulting in a recessive, not dominant, phenotype. This contradicts the definition of a dominant-negative mutation.\n    *   D) This option correctly identifies that the ultimate result is a loss-of-function of the wild-type allele's protein product due to interference from the mutant protein. While protein degradation isn't the primary mechanism described, the \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\" is the key outcome of the dominant-negative interaction. The mutant protein effectively degrades the *function* of the wild-type protein by forming a non-functional complex.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the molecular phenotype is the loss of function of the wild-type allele due to the interfering action of the mutant protein.\n\n<<<D>>>"
