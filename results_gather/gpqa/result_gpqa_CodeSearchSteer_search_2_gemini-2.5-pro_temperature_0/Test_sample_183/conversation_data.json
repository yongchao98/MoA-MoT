    "The user wants to identify the correct reaction sequence to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\nLet's analyze the target molecule and the directing effects of its substituents to determine a logical synthetic strategy.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   The substituents are a tert-butyl group (-tBu), an ethoxy group (-OEt), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   They are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern on the benzene ring.\n*   -OEt is a strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   -tBu is an activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards):**\n\n1.  **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is typically added last via a Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH/EtBr) on the corresponding phenol. The immediate precursor is therefore **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n2.  **Phenol Formation:** A common way to introduce a hydroxyl group onto a benzene ring is through the hydrolysis of a diazonium salt (e.g., adding H₃O⁺/H₂O and heat). The precursor for this step would be the diazonium salt derived from **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n3.  **Diazonium Salt Formation:** This is achieved by treating an aniline with nitrous acid (NaNO₂/HCl). The precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n4.  **Synthesis of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline:** This is the most challenging step, as it requires establishing the 1,2,3-substitution pattern. Let's analyze the options to see how this might be achieved. Direct nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline is complex; the powerful amino group directs ortho and para (to positions 4 and 6), not the desired position 3. A more controlled method is needed.\n\nLet's evaluate the provided options based on fundamental principles of organic synthesis.\n\n*   **Option A:** Starts with nitration (i) to form nitrobenzene. The subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation (iii) on the strongly deactivated nitrobenzene ring would fail or give a very low yield. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence is chemically illogical. Step (iv) is the diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl), which requires an amine. However, the amine is not formed until step (viii) (Fe/HCl reduction). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that has not yet been created. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence is also illogical. An amine is formed in step (iv) and converted to a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this unstable diazonium salt, which is not a standard or viable reaction. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step.\n    *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product is **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**, with o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene as a minor product. For a high-yield synthesis, we must follow the major product.\n    *   iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. This converts p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene to **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. The amino group is a very strong ortho, para-director. To avoid oxidation and control the reaction, the amine is typically protected first (e.g., by acetylation, a step often implied in such problems). The directing effect of the resulting acetamido group (-NHCOCH₃) is still strongly ortho-directing. Nitration will occur at the position ortho to the amine/acetamido group, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline** (after deprotection).\n    *   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group of 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline to form a **diazonium salt**.\n    *   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol, resulting in **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    *   vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ethoxy ether, yielding **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   viii) `SO3/H2SO4` and ix) `dilute H2SO4`: These last two steps, sulfonation followed by desulfonation, are nonsensical at the end of the synthesis and appear to be extraneous.\n\nWhile steps (i) through (vii) of option B outline a coherent synthesis, they produce an isomer (1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) of the desired product. The other options (A, C, D) contain fundamental flaws in their reaction order. Given the choices, Option B is the only one that contains a plausible (though flawed) multi-step synthetic sequence. It is highly likely that there is an error in the question, either in the name of the target molecule or in the listed steps. However, among the given choices, B represents the most chemically reasonable sequence, despite its inconsistencies.\n\n<<<B>>>"
