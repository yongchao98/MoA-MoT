    "The reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. The number of possible organic products can be determined by analyzing the formation of the intermediate and the subsequent nucleophilic attack.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction pathways:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** The strong base, amide ion (NH2-), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n    *   **Path A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion can abstract a hydrogen atom from the C6 position. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect). This elimination of HBr results in the formation of **3-deuterobenzyne**, an intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6, and the deuterium atom remaining at C2.\n    *   **Path B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also abstract the deuterium atom from the C2 position. This pathway is slower but still possible. The elimination of DBr results in the formation of a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate, with the triple bond between C1 and C2.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the highly reactive benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A):** The nucleophile (NH2-) can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n        *   Attack at C1 leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6 leads to the formation of **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Product from benzyne (from Path B):** The nucleophile attacks the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate. Since this intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium, the attack results in a single product: **aniline**.\n\nTherefore, three distinct organic products are possible from this reaction: aniline, 2-deuterioaniline, and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\n<<<B>>>"
