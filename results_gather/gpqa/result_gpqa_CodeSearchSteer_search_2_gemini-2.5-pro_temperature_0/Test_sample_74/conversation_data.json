  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "To determine the cause of the failed protein overexpression, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed in the context of translation.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Start Codon and N-Terminal Tag:** The sequence begins with `5'-ATG...`, which is the correct start codon for translation. Following the start codon is the sequence `TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC`. Translating this sequence (`TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`) yields the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA. This is the correct amino acid sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. Therefore, the sequence for the antigenic determinant is correct, ruling out option B.\n\n2.  **Scan for In-Frame Codons:** The next step is to continue reading the DNA sequence in triplets (codons) from that point to see what comes next.\n    *   **HA Tag:** `...GATTACGCC`\n    *   **Next Codon:** `AAA` (codes for the amino acid Lysine)\n    *   **Following Codon:** `TGA`\n\n3.  **Identify the Premature Stop Codon:** The codon `TGA` is one of the three universal stop codons (along with `UAA` and `UAG` in mRNA, which correspond to `TAA` and `TAG` in the DNA sense strand). These codons signal the ribosome to halt protein synthesis. The presence of the `TGA` codon immediately after the HA tag and a single lysine codon means that the ribosome will detach from the mRNA, terminating translation prematurely. This results in the production of a very short, non-functional peptide instead of the full-length GADD45G protein.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse: This is incorrect because the premature stop codon found in the sequence is `TGA`, not `TAA` (which corresponds to UAA in mRNA).\n    *   B) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation: This is incorrect, as the HA tag sequence is coded correctly.\n    *   C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain: While protein degradation can be an issue, the presence of a premature stop codon is a much more direct and definitive reason for the complete absence of the full-length protein. The problem occurs during translation itself, not after the protein is made.\n    *   D) The ribosome terminated the translation early: This is the correct conclusion. The `TGA` stop codon causes translation to stop almost immediately after it begins, which perfectly explains why the full-length GADD45G protein was not expressed.\n\n<<<D>>>"
