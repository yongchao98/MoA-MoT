    "To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with parallax, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Assume a uniform star distribution.** This means the number of stars per unit volume (the stellar density, ρ) is constant everywhere in space.\n\n2.  **Relate volume to distance.** The number of stars (N) within a certain distance (d) from the observer is the product of the stellar density (ρ) and the volume of a sphere with radius d:\n    *   N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³\n\n3.  **Connect distance to parallax.** The parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d). For simplicity in astronomical units, d = 1/plx. We can substitute this into the equation for N:\n    *   N = ρ * (4/3)π * (1/plx)³ = (4/3)πρ * plx⁻³\n    *   This equation represents the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* a given value `plx` (since they are within the corresponding distance `d`).\n\n4.  **Find the number of stars per unit parallax.** The question asks for how the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* changes. This is equivalent to finding the derivative of N with respect to plx, which tells us the rate of change of the number of stars as parallax changes.\n    *   dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [ (4/3)πρ * plx⁻³ ]\n    *   Using the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n    *   dN/d(plx) = (4/3)πρ * (-3 * plx⁻⁴) = -4πρ * plx⁻⁴\n\n5.  **Interpret the result.** The number of stars in a small interval of parallax, d(plx), is proportional to plx⁻⁴. The negative sign simply indicates that the cumulative number of stars decreases as parallax increases (since larger parallax means smaller distance). The relationship for the number density of stars per unit parallax is therefore:\n    *   dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴\n\nThis relationship is a known result in stellar astronomy, often discussed in the context of observational biases like the Lutz-Kelker bias. Assuming a uniform distribution of stars in space, the number of stars per unit interval of parallax varies as 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<C>>>"
