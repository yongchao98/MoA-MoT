    "To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we must first calculate the energy difference (ΔE) between the initial and final states of the molecule. The momentum (p) of the photon is then found using the relation p = ΔE/c, where c is the speed of light.\n\n1.  **Identify Initial and Final States:**\n    *   The molecule starts in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible vibrational and rotational quantum numbers: vibrational quantum number v=0 and rotational quantum number J=0.\n    *   The absorbed photon causes the molecule to switch to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" For a diatomic molecule, the selection rules for rovibrational transitions are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n    *   Starting from J=0, the only possible rotational transition is to J=1 (an R-branch transition), since J cannot be negative.\n    *   Therefore, the transition is from the initial state (v=0, J=0) to the final state (v=1, J=1).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy of the Transition (ΔE):**\n    The energy of a state in the rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n    E(v, J) = E_vib + E_rot = ħω(v + 1/2) + [ħ² / (2I)] * J(J+1)\n    Where:\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n    *   ω is the angular frequency of vibration (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s)\n    *   I is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n    The energy of the transition is:\n    ΔE = E(v=1, J=1) - E(v=0, J=0)\n    ΔE = [ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ²/(2I)) * 1(1+1)] - [ħω(0 + 1/2) + (ħ²/(2I)) * 0(0+1)]\n    ΔE = [ (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I ] - [ (1/2)ħω ]\n    ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I\n\n3.  **Calculate Necessary Molecular Properties:**\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n        μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n        μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n        Converting to kg: μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n    *   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n        I = μ * R²\n        I ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n        I ≈ 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Components:**\n    *   **Vibrational Energy Change (ħω):**\n        ΔE_vib = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n    *   **Rotational Energy Change (ħ²/I):**\n        ΔE_rot = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\n        ΔE_rot ≈ 9.21 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n    *   **Total Energy Change (ΔE):**\n        ΔE = ΔE_vib + ΔE_rot = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.00921 x 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n5.  **Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p):**\n    p = ΔE / c\n    p ≈ (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s)\n    p ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis result is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
