    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2*a₁))^(1/2) * (1 - A₁)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2*a₂))^(1/2) * (1 - A₂)^(1/4)]\n\nGiven that T_star, R_star, and the albedo (A₁ = A₂) are the same for both planets, these terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1/a₁)^(1/2) / (1/a₂)^(1/2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a₂ / a₁)^(1/2)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a₂ / a₁).\n\n### 2. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (a) by:\n\nK = (M_p / M_star) * v_p\n\nWhere v_p is the planet's orbital velocity, given by v_p = (G * M_star / a)^(1/2). The problem states the planets are detected by the transit method, which implies an orbital inclination `i` ≈ 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1.\n\nSubstituting v_p into the equation for K:\n\nK = (M_p / M_star) * (G * M_star / a)^(1/2)\nK = (M_p * G^(1/2)) / (M_star^(1/2) * a^(1/2))\n\nNow, we solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n\nK² = (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)\na = (G * M_p²) / (K² * M_star)\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\n\nNow we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p₂²) / (K₂² * M_star)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (K₁² * M_star)]\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) cancel out:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) / (M_p₁² / K₁²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n### 4. Plugging in the Values\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ), since K = c * (Δλ / λ₀). Therefore, the ratio K₁ / K₂ is equal to the ratio Δλ₁ / Δλ₂.\n\nGiven values:\n*   M_p₁ = 7 M_earth\n*   M_p₂ = 5 M_earth\n*   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\nNow, we calculate the ratios:\n*   M_p₂ / M_p₁ = 5 / 7\n*   K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nSubstitute these into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\na₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\n### 5. Final Calculation of Temperature Ratio\n\nFinally, substitute the value of a₂ / a₁ back into the temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a₂ / a₁)^(1/2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (225 / 784)^(1/2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √225 / √784\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"
