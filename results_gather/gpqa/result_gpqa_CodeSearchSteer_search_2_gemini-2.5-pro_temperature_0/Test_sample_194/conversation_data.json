    "### Calculation of the Maximum Orbital Period\n\nTo determine the maximum orbital period for the second planet to exhibit both transit and occultation events, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Transit Condition:** A transit occurs when a planet passes in front of its star from the observer's perspective. The geometry of a transit is described by the impact parameter (b), which is the projected distance between the center of the planet and the center of the star at mid-transit, normalized by the star's radius. A transit event happens if this impact parameter is less than or equal to 1 (`b ≤ 1`), meaning the center of the planet passes across the stellar disk. A value of `b = 1` corresponds to a \"grazing\" transit, where the planet's center passes exactly over the star's edge.\n\n2.  **Use Information from Planet 1:** We are given that the first planet has a transit impact parameter `b1 = 0.2` and an orbital period `P1 = 3` days. The impact parameter is defined by the formula:\n    `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`\n    where `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit, `i` is the orbital inclination, and `R_s` is the stellar radius. For Planet 1, we have:\n    `0.2 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s`\n\n3.  **Determine the Condition for Planet 2:** For the second planet to have the *maximum* possible orbital period while still transiting, it must be at the largest possible orbital distance (`a2`) that allows for a transit. This occurs at the maximum possible impact parameter, which is `b2 = 1`. Since both planets are in the same orbital plane, the inclination `i` is the same for both. The condition for Planet 2 is:\n    `1 = (a2_max * cos(i)) / R_s`\n\n4.  **Relate the Two Planets:** We now have a system of two equations. By dividing the equation for Planet 2 by the equation for Planet 1, we can find the ratio of their semi-major axes:\n    `(a2_max * cos(i) / R_s) / (a1 * cos(i) / R_s) = 1 / 0.2`\n    `a2_max / a1 = 5`\n    This shows that the maximum semi-major axis for the second transiting planet is 5 times that of the first planet.\n\n5.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`P² ∝ a³`). We can write this as a ratio for the two planets:\n    `(P2_max / P1)² = (a2_max / a1)³`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Maximum Period:** Substituting the known values into the equation:\n    `(P2_max / 3)² = (5)³`\n    `(P2_max / 3)² = 125`\n    `P2_max / 3 = √125`\n    `P2_max = 3 * √125`\n    `P2_max = 3 * 5√5 = 15√5`\n    `P2_max ≈ 33.54` days.\n\nThis result closely matches one of the provided options. The radii of the planets and the star are not necessary for this calculation, as the condition for a transit event is conventionally defined by the impact parameter `b ≤ 1`. The problem assumes circular orbits and that both planets share the same orbital plane, simplifying the geometric considerations. If a planet transits its star, an occultation (passing behind the star) will also occur half an orbit later given the circular orbit and shared plane.\n\n<<<D>>>"
