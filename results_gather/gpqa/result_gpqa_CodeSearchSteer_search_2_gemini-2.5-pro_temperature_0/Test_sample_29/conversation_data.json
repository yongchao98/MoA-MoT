    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we must first calculate the wavelength of the light it emits and then find the complementary color.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Wavelength of Emitted Light\n\nThe energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. The relationship between energy (E) in electron volts (eV) and wavelength (λ) in nanometers (nm) is given by the formula:\n\nλ = hc / E\n\nA common shortcut for this calculation is λ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV).\n\nUsing this formula:\nλ = 1240 / 2.3393 eV\nλ ≈ 530.07 nm\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Color of the Emitted Light\n\nThe calculated wavelength of approximately 530 nm falls within the green region of the visible light spectrum. Therefore, the textile dye emits green light.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Absorbed Color\n\nWhen a substance emits a certain color, it is because it has absorbed light of the complementary color. The color we perceive is the light that is reflected or transmitted, while the complementary color is absorbed. The complementary color to green is red.\n\nTherefore, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<C>>>"
