    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we must first establish the instrument's capabilities and the visibility of each star from the Paranal Observatory. A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel is achieved during a one-hour exposure.\n\n### ESPRESSO Limiting Magnitude\n\nThe ESPRESSO spectrograph, when coupled with a single 8.2m Very Large Telescope (VLT) Unit Telescope (UT), has several observing modes. A technical paper on ESPRESSO's on-sky performance indicates that for the High Resolution (HR) mode with 4x2 binning (HR42), the limiting magnitude, where the signal is no longer dominated by photon noise, is approximately V ~ 18 mag. Another source suggests that for a one-hour (3600s) exposure in single UT HR mode, a high signal-to-noise ratio can be achieved for stars much fainter than the ones considered here, implying that a V magnitude of 18 is well within the instrument's capabilities for achieving an S/N of 10. Therefore, we will adopt a conservative limiting apparent V magnitude of 18 for detectability.\n\n### Star Visibility from Paranal Observatory\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. This southern latitude dictates which stars are visible in the sky.\n\n*   **Polaris:** Polaris is the North Star, with a declination of about +89° 15′. As a rule, a star is not visible if its declination is greater than 90° minus the observer's latitude. For Paranal, this means stars with declinations significantly above +65.4° are not visible. Therefore, Polaris is not observable from the Paranal Observatory.\n*   **Canopus:** Canopus has a declination of approximately -52° 41′. Being in the southern celestial hemisphere, it is well-positioned for observation from Paranal.\n*   **Stars at DEC = 0 deg:** The four hypothetical stars are located at a declination of 0 degrees, on the celestial equator. These stars are visible from anywhere on Earth, including the Paranal Observatory.\n\n### Analysis of Each Star\n\nNow we assess each star based on its visibility and apparent magnitude.\n\n**a) Canopus:**\n*   **Visibility:** Visible from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude:** Canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent visual magnitude of approximately -0.74.\n*   **Detectability:** Since -0.74 is significantly brighter than the limiting magnitude of 18, Canopus is easily detectable.\n\n**b) Polaris:**\n*   **Visibility:** Not visible from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** As the star is not visible, it is not detectable, regardless of its brightness. Polaris has an apparent magnitude of about 1.98.\n\n**c) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance:**\n*   **Visibility:** Visible from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude (m):** Calculated using the formula m = M + 5 * log10(d/10), where M is the absolute magnitude (15) and d is the distance in parsecs (10).\n    m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15 + 5 * 0 = 15.\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 15 is brighter than the limiting magnitude of 18. This star is detectable.\n\n**d) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance:**\n*   **Visibility:** Visible from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude (m):**\n    m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.301 = 15 + 6.505 = 21.505.\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 21.5 is fainter than the limiting magnitude of 18. This star is not detectable.\n\n**e) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance:**\n*   **Visibility:** Visible from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude (m):**\n    m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (-0.301) = 15 - 1.505 = 13.495.\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 13.5 is brighter than the limiting magnitude of 18. This star is detectable.\n\n**f) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance:**\n*   **Visibility:** Visible from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude (m):**\n    m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 = 15 + 3.495 = 18.495.\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 18.5 is fainter than the limiting magnitude of 18. This star is not detectable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCounting the detectable stars:\n1.  Canopus (Detectable)\n2.  Polaris (Not visible)\n3.  Star at 10 pc (Detectable)\n4.  Star at 200 pc (Not detectable)\n5.  Star at 5 pc (Detectable)\n6.  Star at 50 pc (Not detectable)\n\nIn total, 3 of the listed stars would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph under the given conditions.\n\n<<<A>>>"
