    "To identify the unknown compound, the provided spectroscopic data must be systematically compared against the expected data for each of the four possible structures.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹. The broad peak is characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to hydrogen bonding. The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid. Since all four options are carboxylic acids, this data confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds. All four proposed structures are saturated and consistent with this observation.\n    *   **Complex Splitting:** The key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described. These patterns arise from a proton being coupled to multiple, non-equivalent neighboring protons. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the (n+1) rule, where 'n' is the number of equivalent neighboring protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple *sets* of non-equivalent protons, the splitting pattern becomes more complex (e.g., a doublet of triplets).\n\n### Evaluation of Candidate Structures\n\nLet's analyze the expected ¹H NMR splitting patterns for the most substituted protons (the methine, or C-H, protons) in each candidate molecule.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n*   This molecule has two chiral centers. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ethyl group would be split by the CH₂ of the ethyl group (triplet), the neighboring C-H (doublet), and the methyl group attached to the same carbon (quartet). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   However, the other C-H proton (alpha to the COOH group) would be split by its neighboring C-H (doublet) and the adjacent methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This structure does not account for the observed doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n*   This structure has protons on a carbon chain that would lead to different splitting patterns, such as a doublet of septets, but not the specific dtq and dtt combination observed.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n*   The splitting patterns in this molecule would be complex, but would likely involve quintets due to coupling with CH₂ groups of the ethyl substituents. It would not produce the specific dtq and dtt signals.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nLet's label the key protons in this structure:\n`CH₃(a)-CH(b)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(c)(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂(d)-COOH`\n\n*   **Proton (b):** This proton is coupled to three distinct sets of neighbors:\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (a) → **quartet**.\n    *   The single proton at position (c) → **doublet**.\n    *   The two protons of the ethyl's CH₂ group → **triplet**.\n    *   Combining these gives a predicted signal of a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal described.\n\n*   **Proton (c):** This proton is also coupled to three distinct sets of neighbors:\n    *   The single proton at position (b) → **doublet**.\n    *   The two protons of the ethyl's CH₂ group attached to the same carbon → **triplet**.\n    *   The two protons of the CH₂ group at position (d) → **triplet**.\n    *   Combining these gives a predicted signal of a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal described.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe splitting patterns observed in the ¹H NMR spectrum, specifically a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets, are uniquely consistent with the structure of **CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
