    "When solving partial differential equations like the heat equation numerically, a common step is to discretize the spatial derivatives, which transforms the partial differential equation into a large system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The solution to this system involves the matrix exponential function. For a sequential algorithm, approximating this exponential function with a rational function (a fraction of two polynomials) leads to solving a series of linear systems one after another.\n\nThe key to converting this into a parallel algorithm lies in the mathematical properties of this fractional approximation. By decomposing the rational function into a sum of simpler fractions—a technique known as partial fraction expansion—the problem is transformed. Instead of one complex, sequential task, the problem becomes a set of independent, simpler linear systems. These independent systems can then be solved simultaneously on different processors. The final solution is obtained by combining the results from each processor.\n\nTherefore, the ability to express the fractional approximation as a sum of linear partial fractions is the essential factor that allows for the distribution of the workload across multiple processors, thus converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one.\n\n<<<C>>>"
