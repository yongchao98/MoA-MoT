    "The search results confirm the physics and formulas I used.\n\nSpecifically, result provides the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for circular orbits (e=0):\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_star + M_p)^(2/3)\n\nThe problem states M_p is similar to Neptune and M_star is similar to the Sun. M_Neptune is about 17 times M_Earth, and M_Sun is about 333,000 times M_Earth. So, M_p << M_star, and the approximation (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star is valid.\n\nThe formula becomes:\nK ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)\n\nThis confirms that K is proportional to P^(-1/3), assuming all other factors are constant between the two systems.\n\nThe problem states:\n- M_star1 = M_star2 (given)\n- m_p1 ≈ m_p2 (given as \"similar masses\")\n- The RV method measures M_p * sin(i), so the most reasonable interpretation is that M_p1*sin(i1) ≈ M_p2*sin(i2).\n\nThe wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity (K).\n\nTherefore, the logic holds:\n1.  K is proportional to Δλ.\n    K2 / K1 = Δλ2 / Δλ1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n2.  K is proportional to P^(-1/3).\n    K2 / K1 = (P2 / P1)^(-1/3) = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)\n3.  Equating the two expressions for K2 / K1:\n    1.4 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)\n4.  Solving for P2 / P1:\n    (1.4)³ = P1 / P2\n    2.744 = P1 / P2\n    P2 / P1 = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe result is robust. The answer is approximately 0.36.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 0.36\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nMy calculated value matches option C.\n\nThe problem is a straightforward application of the radial velocity formula, requiring careful algebraic manipulation. The key is to correctly identify the relationship K ∝ P^(-1/3) and to make the standard assumption that \"similar masses\" in an RV context refers to the observable quantity `m_p * sin(i)`.\n\nThe calculation is complete and verified. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\n1.  **State the relationship between wavelength shift and radial velocity amplitude.** The amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is directly proportional to the observed periodic wavelength shift (Δλ).\n2.  **Calculate the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes.** K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7/5 = 1.4.\n3.  **State the formula for the radial velocity amplitude.** For a planet in a circular orbit, K is proportional to M_p*sin(i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)).\n4.  **Apply the given conditions.** The stars have the same mass (M₁ = M₂), and the planets have similar masses (implying m_p₁*sin(i₁) ≈ m_p₂*sin(i₂)).\n5.  **Simplify the relationship.** Under these conditions, K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3).\n6.  **Set up the equation.** K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3).\n7.  **Solve for the period ratio.**\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n    (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644.\n8.  **Compare with the options.** The calculated value of ~0.36 matches option C.\n\nThe reasoning is sound. I will now write the final response.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to relate the observed periodic wavelength shift to the orbital period of the exoplanet using the principles of the Radial Velocity (RV) method.\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The periodic shift in the spectral line's wavelength (Δλ) is caused by the Doppler effect due to the star's motion along our line of sight. This motion is induced by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The amplitude of the star's radial velocity (denoted as K) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Formula:** The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) for a star with an orbiting planet is given by the formula:\n    K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\n    This formula applies under the given conditions: circular orbits (eccentricity e=0) and a planet mass (m_p) much smaller than the star's mass (M_star). Here, P is the orbital period, G is the gravitational constant, m_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and i is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Applying the Given Information:** We are given that:\n    *   The stars have identical masses: M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂. In the context of the RV method, the measured quantity is the minimum mass, m_p * sin(i). The problem's phrasing implies that this value is similar for both planets, so we can assume m_p₁ * sin(i₁) ≈ m_p₂ * sin(i₂).\n\n4.  **Finding the Relationship between K and P:** Since M_star and m_p * sin(i) are the same for both systems, the formula simplifies to show that the radial velocity amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period P:\n    K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** We can now set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We already calculated that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. Substituting this value:\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. We find this by taking the reciprocal:\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36. Comparing this to the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
