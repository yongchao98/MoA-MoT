    "The treatment of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst results in a self-metathesis reaction. This reaction involves the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds. The starting material is a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n\nThe self-metathesis reaction of a terminal alkene like 3-methylpent-1-ene (CH₂=CH–R) produces ethene and a symmetrical, internally unsaturated alkene (R–CH=CH–R). In this specific case, the R group is a chiral sec-butyl group, -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃. The resulting product, excluding ethene, is 3,6-dimethyl-4-octene.\n\nDue to the racemic nature of the starting material, three different reaction pairings can occur:\n1.  Reaction between two (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene molecules.\n2.  Reaction between two (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene molecules.\n3.  Reaction between one (R) and one (S) molecule.\n\nThese pairings lead to products with different stereochemistry at the C3 and C6 positions, as well as E/Z (cis/trans) isomerism at the newly formed C4=C5 double bond.\n\nThe possible products are:\n*   **From the (R) + (R) reaction:** This pairing produces (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. This can exist as two geometric isomers:\n    *   (E)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n    *   (Z)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n*   **From the (S) + (S) reaction:** This pairing produces the enantiomers of the (R)+(R) products, which are (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. These are distinct compounds and also exist as two geometric isomers:\n    *   (E)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n    *   (Z)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n*   **From the (R) + (S) reaction:** This cross-reaction produces (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. Due to the opposite configurations at the two chiral centers, these products are meso compounds (achiral molecules with chiral centers). There are two such meso products:\n    *   (E)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (a meso compound)\n    *   (Z)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (a meso compound)\n\nIn total, there are four stereoisomers that form two pairs of enantiomers, and two additional diastereomeric meso compounds. Counting each of these distinct chemical compounds, there are a total of six possible products.\n\n<<<C>>>"
