    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics applied to binary star systems.\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M = m₁ + m₂) can be derived from Kepler's Third Law. The relationship connects the orbital period (P), the sum of the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ + K₂), and the inclination of the orbit (i):\n\nM = [P / (2πG)] * [(K₁ + K₂ )³ / sin³(i)]\n\nIn this problem, both systems are described as exhibiting eclipses. For an eclipse to occur, the orbital plane must be viewed nearly edge-on, which means the inclination angle *i* is approximately 90°. When *i* ≈ 90°, sin(*i*) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(*i*) ≈ 1. This simplifies the mass calculation significantly.\n\nThe simplified formula for the total mass of an eclipsing binary system is:\n\nM ≈ [P * (K₁ + K₂)³] / (2πG)\n\nTo find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M₁) to the mass of system_2 (M₂), we can set up the following equation:\n\nM₁ / M₂ ≈ { [P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³] / (2πG) } / { [P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³] / (2πG) }\n\nThe constant term (2πG) cancels out, leaving:\n\nM₁ / M₂ ≈ [P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³] / [P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³]\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values:\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nPlugging these values into the ratio equation:\n\nM₁ / M₂ ≈ [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nM₁ / M₂ ≈ 2 * (15/25)³\nM₁ / M₂ ≈ 2 * (3/5)³\nM₁ / M₂ ≈ 2 * (27 / 125)\nM₁ / M₂ ≈ 54 / 125\nM₁ / M₂ ≈ 0.432\n\nThe calculated mass ratio is approximately 0.432. Comparing this result to the given options:\n\nA) ~ 0.6\nB) ~ 0.7\nC) ~ 0.4\nD) ~ 1.2\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
