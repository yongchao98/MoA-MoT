    "Here is a step-by-step solution to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts was passed through three tubes. Let's analyze the change in each tube to identify the products.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase is 3.60 g, which is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change, indicating that no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The oxygen must have come from a gaseous oxide that is not acidic and reacts with hot copper. The two common possibilities are nitrous oxide (N₂O) or oxygen (O₂). However, the problem states that a gas C remained *after* this tube. If the gas were O₂, it would be consumed, and it's unlikely that the initial mixture contained elemental nitrogen. A more plausible scenario is the reaction of N₂O with copper: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. In this reaction, 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of oxygen atoms to form CuO.\n    *   Therefore, 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms came from **0.05 mol of N₂O**. This reaction also produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   The volume of the remaining gas is 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas C is the nitrogen (N₂) that passed through all the tubes. It consists of any N₂ produced directly from the decomposition plus the N₂ produced from the reaction of N₂O with copper.\n    *   Total N₂ = N₂ (original) + N₂ (from N₂O reaction)\n    *   0.10 mol = N₂ (original) + 0.05 mol\n    *   So, the amount of N₂ produced directly from the decomposition is **0.05 mol**.\n\nTo summarize, the decomposition of the 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B yielded:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂\n\n### 2. Identification of Salts A and B\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products is:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of N₂O = 0.05 mol * 44.0 g/mol = 2.20 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.05 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 1.40 g\n*   Total Mass = 3.60 + 2.20 + 1.40 = 7.20 g\n\nThis total mass is equal to the initial mass of the salt mixture. This confirms that the salts decomposed completely into these gaseous products.\n\nThe salts A and B are in an equimolar mixture. Let's assume `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B were heated.\nThe overall reaction is:\n`n`A + `n`B → 0.05 N₂ + 0.05 N₂O + 0.20 H₂O\n\nDividing the product moles by the smallest value (0.05) gives a ratio of 1 N₂ : 1 N₂O : 4 H₂O.\nThis suggests that the decomposition of one mole of A and one mole of B produces 1 mole of N₂, 1 mole of N₂O, and 4 moles of H₂O.\nLet's look for two common nitrogen-containing salts whose decomposition products match this. The most common salts that produce these gases are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nIf we have an equimolar mixture of these two salts, their combined decomposition is:\nNH₄NO₂ + NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + N₂O + 4H₂O\n\nThis perfectly matches the 1:1:4 molar ratio of the products we deduced. Thus, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\nLet's verify the moles. The reaction `n`A + `n`B produced 0.05 mol of N₂ and 0.05 mol of N₂O. This means `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * (64.0 g/mol) = 3.20 g\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * (80.0 g/mol) = 4.00 g\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass given in the problem.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (or B): Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (or A): Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in NH₄NO₂) + (Atoms in NH₄NO₃) = 8 + 9 = **17 atoms**.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<C>>>"
