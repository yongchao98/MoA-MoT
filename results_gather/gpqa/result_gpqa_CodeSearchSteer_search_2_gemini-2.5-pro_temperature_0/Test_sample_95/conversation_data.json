    "The google search confirms the formulas I used.\n\n*   **Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy:** `S = (k * A) / (4 * l_p^2)` where `k` is the Boltzmann constant, `A` is the event horizon area, and `l_p` is the Planck length. This is confirmed by multiple sources. The formula can also be written as `S = (k * c^3 * A) / (4 * G * ħ)`, which is equivalent.\n*   **Event Horizon Area:** For a Schwarzschild black hole, the area `A` is `4 * π * R_s^2`, where `R_s` is the Schwarzschild radius.\n*   **Angular Diameter Relation:** For a small angle `θ` (in radians), the physical size `D` (diameter) of an object at distance `d` is given by `D ≈ d * θ`.\n*   **Schwarzschild Radius:** `R_s = D / 2`.\n\nThe constants are also confirmed.\n*   Boltzmann constant (k) ≈ 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n*   Planck length (l_p) ≈ 1.616 × 10⁻³⁵ m\n*   1 parsec ≈ 3.086 × 10¹⁶ m\n\nThe calculation steps were:\n1.  Convert distance `d` to meters: `d = 10^10 pc * 3.086 * 10^16 m/pc = 3.086 * 10^26 m`.\n2.  Convert angular size `θ` to radians: `θ = 10^-17 deg * (π / 180) rad/deg ≈ 1.745 * 10^-19 rad`.\n3.  Calculate the diameter `D` of the event horizon: `D = d * θ = (3.086 * 10^26 m) * (1.745 * 10^-19) ≈ 5.38 * 10^7 m`.\n4.  Calculate the Schwarzschild radius `R_s`: `R_s = D / 2 = 2.69 * 10^7 m`.\n5.  Calculate the event horizon area `A`: `A = 4 * π * R_s^2 = 4 * π * (2.69 * 10^7 m)^2 ≈ 9.09 * 10^15 m^2`.\n6.  Calculate the entropy `S`: `S = (k * A) / (4 * l_p^2) = (1.38 * 10^-23 J/K * 9.09 * 10^15 m^2) / (4 * (1.616 * 10^-35 m)^2) ≈ 1.2 * 10^62 J/K`.\n\nThe result is robustly on the order of 10^62 J/K.\n\nOne search result shows a calculation for the exact same problem. However, it contains a significant error in calculating the radius `r`. It calculates `r ≈ 5.39 × 10⁻³ m`, which seems to be a result of a calculation mistake. My calculation gives `R_s ≈ 2.69 * 10^7 m`. The huge discrepancy in the radius leads to a completely different final answer in that source. My calculation is consistent with the physical formulas and constants.\n\nTherefore, based on my step-by-step calculation, the order of magnitude is 10^62 J/K.\n\nFinal check of the order of magnitude calculation:\n*   d ~ 10^10 * 3e16 = 3e26 m\n*   θ ~ 1e-17 * (3/180) ~ 1e-17 * 1.7e-2 ~ 1.7e-19 rad\n*   D ~ 3e26 * 1.7e-19 = 5.1e7 m\n*   Rs ~ 2.5e7 m\n*   A ~ 4 * 3 * (2.5e7)^2 = 12 * 6.25e14 = 75e14 = 7.5e15 m^2\n*   k ~ 1.4e-23 J/K\n*   lp ~ 1.6e-35 m => lp^2 ~ 2.6e-70 m^2\n*   S ~ (1.4e-23 * 7.5e15) / (4 * 2.6e-70) ~ 10.5e-8 / 10.4e-70 ~ 1e-8 * 1e70 = 1e62 J/K.\n\nThe calculation is correct. The order of magnitude is 10^62 J/K. This corresponds to option A.To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we can use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula. The calculation involves several steps, starting from the given observational data.\n\nFirst, we determine the physical size of the event horizon from its angular size and distance. The relationship between the physical diameter (D) of an object, its angular diameter (θ), and the distance to it (d) is given by the small-angle formula: D = θ × d.\n\nThe given values are:\n*   Distance, d = 10¹⁰ parsecs\n*   Angular size, θ = 10⁻¹⁷ degrees\n\nWe need to convert these values into standard units (meters and radians).\n\n1.  **Convert the distance to meters:**\n    1 parsec is approximately 3.086 × 10¹⁶ meters.\n    d = 10¹⁰ pc × (3.086 × 10¹⁶ m/pc) = 3.086 × 10²⁶ m.\n\n2.  **Convert the angular size to radians:**\n    1 degree is π/180 radians.\n    θ = 10⁻¹⁷ degrees × (π / 180) rad/degree ≈ 1.745 × 10⁻¹⁹ radians.\n\n3.  **Calculate the diameter of the event horizon (D):**\n    D = θ × d = (1.745 × 10⁻¹⁹ rad) × (3.086 × 10²⁶ m) ≈ 5.38 × 10⁷ m.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Schwarzschild radius (Rₛ):**\n    The radius is half the diameter.\n    Rₛ = D / 2 = (5.38 × 10⁷ m) / 2 = 2.69 × 10⁷ m.\n\n5.  **Calculate the area of the event horizon (A):**\n    The area of the event horizon of a non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole is given by A = 4πRₛ².\n    A = 4π × (2.69 × 10⁷ m)² ≈ 9.09 × 10¹⁵ m².\n\n6.  **Calculate the entropy (S) of the black hole:**\n    The Bekenstein-Hawking formula for entropy is S = (k * A) / (4 * lₚ²), where k is the Boltzmann constant and lₚ is the Planck length.\n    *   Boltzmann constant, k ≈ 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   Planck length, lₚ ≈ 1.616 × 10⁻³⁵ m\n\n    S = (1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K × 9.09 × 10¹⁵ m²) / (4 × (1.616 × 10⁻³⁵ m)²)\n    S ≈ (1.254 × 10⁻⁷ J/K·m²) / (4 × 2.611 × 10⁻⁷⁰ m²)\n    S ≈ (1.254 × 10⁻⁷ J/K·m²) / (1.044 × 10⁻⁶⁹ m²)\n    S ≈ 1.20 × 10⁶² J/K.\n\nThe calculated entropy is approximately 1.20 × 10⁶² J/K. The order of magnitude is therefore 10⁶² J/K.\n\n<<<A>>>"
