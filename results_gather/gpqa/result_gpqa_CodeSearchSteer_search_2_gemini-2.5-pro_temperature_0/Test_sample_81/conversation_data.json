    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the major isomer of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclooctatetraene heated with maleic anhydride**\n\nWhen heated, cyclooctatetraene (COT), which exists in a non-planar tub conformation, enters into an equilibrium with its valence isomer, bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene. This isomerization is a thermal 6Ï€-electrocyclic reaction. Bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene contains a reactive 1,3-cyclohexadiene system that readily undergoes a Diels-Alder reaction with maleic anhydride, a good dienophile. According to the Alder-endo rule, which governs the stereoselectivity of many Diels-Alder reactions, the dienophile adds in an *endo* orientation. This means the anhydride group is oriented on the same side of the newly formed six-membered ring as the longest bridge (in this case, the bridge containing the cyclobutene ring). This reaction traps the bicyclic isomer and forms Product 1, the *endo* adduct.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with methanol and sulfuric acid**\n\nProduct 1, a cyclic anhydride, is heated with methanol in the presence of a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction. The acid protonates a carbonyl oxygen of the anhydride, making it more electrophilic. Methanol then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon and leading to the opening of the anhydride ring. A second molecule of methanol reacts to form a second ester group. The result is the formation of a dimethyl dicarboxylate (Product 2). This reaction converts the anhydride to two methyl ester groups but does not alter the stereochemistry of the carbon framework established in the first step.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 heated with cyclopentadiene**\n\nProduct 2 contains a strained double bond within its cyclobutene ring, which can act as a dienophile in a second Diels-Alder reaction. Cyclopentadiene, a highly reactive diene, is introduced. The stereochemical outcome of this second cycloaddition is determined by the approach of the cyclopentadiene to the dienophile (Product 2). The molecule of Product 2 has a concave and a convex face. The bulky diester group, being in the *endo* position from the first reaction, occupies the concave face. For the second Diels-Alder reaction, the cyclopentadiene will approach from the less sterically hindered convex face. This mode of addition is known as an *exo* attack (relative to the dienophile's existing stereocenters).\n\n**Conclusion: The Structure of Product 3**\n\nThe final product, Product 3, is the result of two sequential Diels-Alder reactions, followed by an esterification.\n1.  The first Diels-Alder reaction proceeds with *endo* selectivity.\n2.  The second Diels-Alder reaction proceeds with *exo* selectivity due to steric hindrance.\n\nThis specific sequence of stereoselectivity leads to the formation of a single major diastereomer. By analyzing the stereochemical descriptors provided in the options, the structure corresponding to this reaction pathway is **dimethyl (1R,4S,4aR,4bR,5R,8S,8aS,8bS,10S,11R)-1,4,4a,4b,5,8,8a,8b-octahydro-1,4-ethano-5,8-methanobiphenylene-10,11-dicarboxylate**.\n\nThe SMILES string for this molecule is: `O=C(OC)[C@@H]1[C@H](C=C2)[C@@H]3[C@@H]([C@H]4[C@@H]3[C@@H]5C=C[C@H]4C5)[C@H]2[C@@H]1C(OC)=O`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
