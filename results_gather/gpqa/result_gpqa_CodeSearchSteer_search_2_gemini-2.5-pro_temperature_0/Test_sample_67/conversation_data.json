    "The physical phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the particle's spin is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in an eigenstate of the Z-component of the spin operator, `Sz`. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the spin begins to precess around the new field direction.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is given by `H = -μ · B`. Since the magnetic moment `μ` is proportional to the spin `S` by the gyromagnetic ratio `γ` (i.e., `μ = γS`), the Hamiltonian becomes `H = -γS · B`.\n\nIn this problem, the new magnetic field is `B = Bŷ`, so the Hamiltonian is `H = -γB * Sy`, where `Sy` is the Y-component of the spin operator.\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of any spin component will be an oscillation. This is the quantum mechanical analogue of Larmor precession. The angular frequency of this precession is given by the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<Sz(t)>`, will oscillate as `cos(γBt)`. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
