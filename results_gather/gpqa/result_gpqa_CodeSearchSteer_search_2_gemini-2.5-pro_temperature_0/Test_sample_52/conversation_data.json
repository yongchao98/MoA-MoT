    "Based on the provided spectroscopic data, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is determined by systematically identifying its structural fragments.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum**: The presence of absorption peaks for an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed.\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum**:\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring**: This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents (a C₆H₄ group). The presence of only two signals for the aromatic protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern, which results in a symmetrical structure with two equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Ester Group and Methyl Signals**: The FTIR shows an ester. The ¹H NMR shows two -CH₃ signals and, crucially, no -CH₂ signals. An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or any longer-chain ester would contain -CH₂ groups. Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) to avoid any -CH₂ signals. This accounts for one of the two -CH₃ signals observed.\n    *   **Vinyl and Second Methyl Group**: The remaining signals are two vinyl protons (one doublet, one doublet of quartets) and a second -CH₃ group. This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). In this fragment, the vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton and the three methyl protons, resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighboring vinyl proton, appearing as a doublet. The methyl group is split by one vinyl proton, appearing as a doublet. This accounts for the two vinyl signals and the second -CH₃ signal.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\nBy combining the identified fragments, we can deduce the structure and its chemical formula:\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring**: C₆H₄\n*   **Substituent 1 (Ester)**: -COOCH₃ (which contains C₂H₃O₂)\n*   **Substituent 2 (Vinyl group)**: -CH=CH-CH₃ (which contains C₃H₅)\n\nThe complete structure is Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n### Calculating the Chemical Formula\n\nSumming the atoms from all fragments:\n\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 (from ring) + 2 (from ester) + 3 (from propenyl) = 11\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: 4 (from ring) + 3 (from ester) + 5 (from propenyl) = 12\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 (from ester)\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This formula corresponds to the identified structure, which is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<D>>>"
