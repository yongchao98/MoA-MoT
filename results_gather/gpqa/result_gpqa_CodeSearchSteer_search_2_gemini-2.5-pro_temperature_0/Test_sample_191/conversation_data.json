    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the physics problem:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the uncharged spherical conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge, `-q`, on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law, which states that the electric field inside the material of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially uncharged (neutral). To maintain its overall neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to balance the `-q` induced on the inner surface.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. The charges inside the cavity (the original `+q` and the induced `-q` on the inner wall) have no effect on the electric field outside the conductor. The electric field inside the bulk of the conductor is zero.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Due to the shielding effect, the `+q` charge on the outer surface is not influenced by the position of the charge `+q` or the cavity inside. Because the conductor is a sphere, this outer charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the surface.\n\n5.  **Calculating the External Electric Field:** For any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field can be calculated as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere. In this case, the uniformly distributed `+q` on the outer surface creates an electric field at point P as if it were a point charge `+q` located at the center of the large spherical conductor.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe other parameters, such as the cavity's radius `r`, its distance from the center `s`, the distance `l`, and the angle `Î¸`, are irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to the principle of electrostatic shielding.\n\nBased on this analysis, option A correctly describes the magnitude of the electric field at point P.\n\n<<<A>>>"
