    "This problem requires an understanding of the selective reactivity of different reducing agents towards functional groups, specifically esters and carboxylic acids.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe starting materials are stereoisomers of a dicarboxylic acid monoester: `(R)-` or `(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu). The product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. The formation of this six-membered ring lactone occurs through the reduction of one of the carbonyl-containing groups to an alcohol, followed by an acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n**Reaction 1: Reduction with LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group of the starting material (A) to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains largely unaffected. The resulting intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Cyclization:** The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxyl group and catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the newly formed hydroxyl group and the existing carboxylic acid group to form the delta-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The original stereocenter at carbon 3 (C3) of the starting material is not involved in the reaction and becomes the stereocenter at carbon 4 (C4) of the lactone product. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. Since the product is `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material **A** must have been **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: Reduction with BH₃**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃), often used as a complex with THF (BH₃-THF), is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material (B) to a primary alcohol. The isobutyl ester group remains intact. The resulting intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n*   **Cyclization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carbonyl of the isobutyl ester, forming the delta-lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the stereocenter at C3 is unaffected and becomes C4 in the product. The stereochemistry is retained. Since the product is `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material **B** must have been **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the selective nature of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
