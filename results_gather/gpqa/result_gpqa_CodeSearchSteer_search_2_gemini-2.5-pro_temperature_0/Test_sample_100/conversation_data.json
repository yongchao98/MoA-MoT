    "The reaction described is the formation of an enamine from a secondary amine and a carbonyl compound.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Product:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** 3-methylpyrrolidine is a secondary amine.\n    *   **Product:** 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. The \"enamine\" functional group consists of an amine attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (`C=C-N`). The structure of the product indicates that the nitrogen of the pyrrolidine ring is attached to a `CH` group, which is double-bonded to a cyclohexane ring.\n2.  **Determine Reagent A:** Enamines are formed through the condensation of an aldehyde or a ketone with a secondary amine. The structure of the product requires a carbonyl compound that can provide the cyclohexylidene-methyl (`(C₆H₁₀)=CH-`) fragment.\n    *   Vinylcyclohexane is an alkene and does not have the necessary carbonyl group.\n    *   Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`) is an aldehyde. When it reacts with the secondary amine (3-methylpyrrolidine), it can form the specific double bond arrangement seen in the product after dehydration. The reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of the amine on the aldehyde's carbonyl carbon, followed by the elimination of a water molecule. Therefore, reagent A must be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n3.  **Determine Catalyst B:** The formation of an enamine is an acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction. The catalyst protonates the hydroxyl group of an intermediate (a carbinolamine), turning it into a good leaving group (water).\n    *   While weak acids like acetic acid can be used, strong acids are generally more effective for this dehydration step.\n    *   p-Toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) is a strong organic acid commonly used as a catalyst for imine and enamine formations because it is highly effective at promoting the elimination of water. It is often used to drive the reaction to completion.\n\n**Conclusion:** The appropriate reagent (A) is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the suitable catalyst (B) is p-toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH).\n\n<<<C>>>"
