    "To determine the time elapsed for the astronaut, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n### 1. Required Information\n\n*   **Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC):** The distance from Earth to the LMC is approximately 163,000 light-years.\n*   **Time Dilation Formula:** The formula for time dilation is T = T₀ / √(1 - v²/c²), where T is the time observed by a stationary observer, T₀ is the time experienced by the moving observer (the proper time), v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light. This can also be written as T₀ = T * √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n### 2. Calculation Steps\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the travel time from Earth's perspective (T).**\n\nThe spacecraft travels at a constant speed of 0.99999987 *c*. The time it takes to travel 163,000 light-years from Earth's frame of reference is:\n\n*   T = Distance / Velocity\n*   T = 163,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)\n*   T ≈ 163,000.02 years\n\nSo, from an observer on Earth's point of view, the journey takes just over 163,000 years.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (T₀).**\n\nNow, we apply the time dilation formula to find the time that passes for the astronaut.\n\n*   T₀ = T * √(1 - (v/c)²)\n*   T₀ ≈ 163,000.02 * √(1 - (0.99999987)²)\n*   T₀ ≈ 163,000.02 * √(1 - 0.99999974)\n*   T₀ ≈ 163,000.02 * √(0.00000026)\n*   T₀ ≈ 163,000.02 * 0.0005099\n*   T₀ ≈ 83.11 years\n\nThe journey will take approximately 83.11 years from the astronaut's perspective.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe astronaut is 22 years old when the journey begins. The time elapsed for the astronaut during the trip is about 83 years.\n\n*   Astronaut's age upon arrival: 22 + 83.11 = 105.11 years.\n\nSince the average lifetime of the alien species is 150 years, the astronaut will survive the journey. The calculated travel time of approximately 83 years is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
