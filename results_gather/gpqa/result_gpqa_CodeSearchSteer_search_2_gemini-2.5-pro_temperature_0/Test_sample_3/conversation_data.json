    "In our universe, one of Maxwell's equations, known as Gauss's law for magnetism, is a mathematical statement that isolated magnetic poles (monopoles) do not exist. This law states that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇ ⋅ B) is zero, meaning that magnetic field lines always form closed loops and never start or end at a single point.\n\nIn a parallel universe where magnetic monopoles are real, two of Maxwell's equations would need to be modified to account for them.\n\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (related to the divergence of the magnetic field):** This is the most direct change. The equation ∇ ⋅ B = 0 would be altered to ∇ ⋅ B = ρm (where ρm represents the magnetic charge density). This new form indicates that the magnetic field can now diverge from a source (a magnetic monopole), just as the electric field diverges from an electric charge.\n\n2.  **Faraday's Law of Induction (related to the circulation of the electric field):** To maintain the symmetry of the equations, Faraday's Law would also be modified. Just as a moving electric charge (an electric current) creates a circulating magnetic field (Ampere's Law), a moving magnetic monopole (a magnetic current, Jm) would create a circulating electric field. The equation would change from ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t to include a term for this magnetic current, such as ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - Jm.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would be different are the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the one related to the circulation (or curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<D>>>"
