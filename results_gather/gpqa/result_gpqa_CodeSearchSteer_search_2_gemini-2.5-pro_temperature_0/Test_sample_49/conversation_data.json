    "The number of loops in the Feynman diagram can be determined from the mathematical expression provided, specifically from the factor involving powers of `4π`.\n\nIn quantum field theory calculations for four-dimensional spacetime, each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of `1/(16π²)` to the overall expression for the diagram's amplitude. This can be rewritten as `1/((4π)²)`.\n\nThe expression given is:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nTo find the number of loops, we can isolate the loop factor and set it equal to the general form for an L-loop diagram:\n\n`(1/(4π)²)^L = 1/(4π)^6`\n\nHere, `L` represents the number of loops. By comparing the exponents, we can solve for `L`:\n\n`2 * L = 6`\n`L = 3`\n\nThe other terms in the expression relate to different aspects of the diagram. For instance, `alpha^3` and `g^2` are related to the coupling constants which determine the strength of the interactions at the vertices. The term `(Q/M)^2` is a kinematic factor involving the ratio of two different energy scales. However, the power of `1/(4π)` is the most direct indicator of the loop order.\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<C>>>"
