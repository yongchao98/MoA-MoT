    "The relationship between the two mean free paths, λ1 and λ2, is determined by the nature of the collisions occurring in each case.\n\n*   **λ1: Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules:** This is the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. This is governed by the kinetic theory of gases. The collision is between two particles of similar size.\n*   **λ2: Mean Free Path of Electrons:** This is the average distance an electron from the beam travels before it is scattered by a gas molecule.\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ), which represents the effective area for a collision to occur. The formula is generally expressed as λ = 1/(nσ), where 'n' is the number density of the target particles.\n\nIn this scenario, the number density 'n' of the residual gas molecules is the same for both calculations. The key difference lies in the collision cross-section.\n\n1.  **Gas-Gas Collision (σ1):** For λ1, the collision is between two gas molecules. The cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n2.  **Electron-Gas Collision (σ2):** For λ2, the collision is between a high-energy electron and a gas molecule. An electron is a point-like particle, or at least vastly smaller than a gas molecule. Therefore, the effective area it presents for a collision is significantly smaller than the area presented by another gas molecule. The electron can travel through the atomic structure of the gas molecule, only being scattered by a close encounter with the nucleus or its electron cloud. This results in a much smaller collision cross-section (σ2 << σ1).\n\nSince the mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section, a much smaller cross-section for the electron-gas interaction results in a much longer mean free path. Therefore, λ2 will be significantly larger than λ1.\n\nLooking at the options:\n*   A) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect. The collision types are different.\n*   B) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect. This would imply electrons collide more frequently than gas molecules, which is contrary to the physics.\n*   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This is consistent with λ2 being larger than λ1. It establishes a lower bound but allows for λ2 to be significantly larger, which aligns with the physical principles.\n*   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This suggests λ2 is only slightly larger than λ1. This contradicts the physical expectation that the electron's mean free path should be substantially longer.\n\nBased on the physical principles, the mean free path of the electron (λ2) must be significantly greater than the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ1). Option C is the only one that correctly reflects this relationship by allowing for a potentially much larger value of λ2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
