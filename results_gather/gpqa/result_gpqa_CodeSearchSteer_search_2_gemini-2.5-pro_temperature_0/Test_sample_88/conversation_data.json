    "This multi-step synthesis problem requires a careful deduction of the structures of three sequential products.\n\n*   **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    The reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with a strong base (KOH) at high temperature is known to cause a ring-opening rearrangement. The adamantane cage rearranges to a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system. The product, **1**, is bicyclo[3.3.1]non-6-ene-3-carbaldehyde. The provided spectral data for product 1 in the prompt appears to be erroneous, as the known product is an aldehyde, which would show a characteristic proton signal around 9-10 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a conjugated aldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, which is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces aldehydes and ketones to the corresponding alcohols. Therefore, the aldehyde group in product **1** is reduced to a primary alcohol, yielding product **2**, which is (bicyclo[3.3.1]non-6-en-3-yl)methanol. The C=C double bond is unaffected by this reagent.\n\n*   **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. In the case of bicyclo[3.3.1]non-6-ene derivatives, this cleavage opens one of the rings to form a substituted cyclooctane derivative. The resulting product, **3**, is *cis*-4-(hydroxymethyl)cyclooctane-1,5-dicarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n    We need to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product **3** (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton and the aldehyde -CHO protons). The most deshielded C-H protons in this molecule would be those on carbons adjacent (alpha) to the electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups. These are the protons at positions C2, C6, and C8.\n\n    Let's analyze the splitting pattern for one of these, for example, a proton at the C2 position (H2).\n    1.  It is coupled to the aldehyde proton at C1. This vicinal coupling (³J) will split the signal into a **doublet**.\n    2.  It is also coupled to the two non-equivalent protons on the adjacent C3 carbon. In an eight-membered ring, which is flexible, the coupling constants to these two protons are often averaged or similar, causing them to split the signal as a **triplet**.\n\n    Therefore, the signal for the proton at C2 is split by one adjacent aldehyde proton and two adjacent methylene protons. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**. This would also be the pattern for the protons at C6 and C8.\n\n<<<B>>>"
