    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Role of Gene G2\n*   The single knock-out mutant `g2` shows 0% resistance, a complete loss of the wild-type phenotype.\n*   The double mutants `g1g2` and `g2g3` also show 0% resistance.\n*   This means that when gene G2 is knocked out, the status of G1 and G3 becomes irrelevant; resistance is already zero. This is the definition of **epistasis**, where the mutation in one gene (G2) masks the phenotypic effects of mutations in other genes (G1 and G3).\n*   In a genetic pathway, the gene that is epistatic to others is typically upstream. Since the problem states at least one gene is a transcription factor (a master regulator that turns other genes on or off), G2 is the strongest candidate for this role. Its presence is absolutely required for the resistance pathway to function.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Roles of Genes G1 and G3\n*   The `g1` mutant has 75% resistance, meaning G1 is responsible for some, but not all, of the plant's resistance. The loss of G1 leads to a 25% drop in resistance.\n*   The `g3` mutant has 50% resistance, meaning G3 has a more significant role than G1. The loss of G3 leads to a 50% drop in resistance.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Interaction between G1 and G3\n*   If the genes acted independently and their effects were simply additive, the resistance of the double mutant `g1g3` would be the starting resistance (100%) minus the losses from each mutation (25% + 50%). This predicts a resistance of 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%.\n*   However, the experimental result for the `g1g3` double mutant is 10% resistance.\n*   Since the observed phenotype (10% resistance) is more severe than the expected additive phenotype (25% resistance), the genes G1 and G3 have a **synergistic interaction**. This often implies that the genes function in parallel pathways that contribute to the same outcome, or that their gene products have partially overlapping, or redundant, functions.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Given Options\nLet's evaluate each option based on the conclusions above:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: This is consistent with our analysis.\n    *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: This is a plausible hypothesis for how a single transcription factor (G2) could regulate both genes, but it cannot be concluded with certainty from this data.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: This is incorrect by the standard definition, as the `g1g3` phenotype (10% resistance) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50% resistance). However, in the context of a multiple-choice question with potential flaws, sometimes \"epistatic\" is used loosely to refer to the gene with the stronger phenotypic effect. Since the `g3` mutation causes a larger drop in resistance (50%) than the `g1` mutation (25%), this might be the intended, albeit non-standard, meaning.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Pleiotropy means one gene affects multiple traits. This experiment only measures one trait (anthracnose resistance), so there is no evidence for pleiotropy.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: This is incorrect; the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: This is highly unlikely. The `g1` mutant has the mildest phenotype, whereas the upstream transcription factor (G2) has the most severe.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: This is a good description of their synergistic interaction.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: This is incorrect.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nComparing the options, Option A presents the most plausible overall scenario, despite the imprecise use of the term \"epistasis\". The core conclusions that G2 is the upstream transcription factor and that G1 and G3 are downstream are best represented in this option. The idea that G3 is \"epistatic\" is the most likely intended answer if interpreted as G3 having a stronger effect than G1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
