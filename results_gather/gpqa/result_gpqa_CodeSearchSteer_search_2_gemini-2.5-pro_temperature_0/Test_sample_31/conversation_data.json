    "To determine the total energy of the Lithium-6 (⁶Li) nucleus traveling at 0.96c (96% of the speed of light), we will use the principles of special relativity.\n\nFirst, we identify the nucleus in question. Lithium (Li) has an atomic number of 3, meaning it has 3 protons. The problem specifies it also has 3 neutrons, so its mass number is 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. Thus, the nucleus is ⁶Li.\n\nThe total energy (E) of a relativistic particle is given by the equation E = γE₀, where E₀ is the rest energy and γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n1.  **Calculate the rest energy (E₀):**\n    The rest energy is determined by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula, E₀ = m₀c², where m₀ is the rest mass of the nucleus.\n\n    *   The atomic mass of a ⁶Li atom is 6.015122 atomic mass units (amu).\n    *   To find the nuclear mass, we must subtract the mass of its 3 electrons. The mass of a single electron is approximately 0.00054858 amu.\n    *   Mass of 3 electrons = 3 * 0.00054858 amu = 0.00164574 amu.\n    *   Rest mass of ⁶Li nucleus (m₀) = 6.015122 amu - 0.00164574 amu = 6.01347626 amu.\n    *   We can convert this mass to energy in Giga-electronvolts (GeV) using the conversion factor 1 amu ≈ 0.9314941 GeV/c².\n    *   E₀ = 6.01347626 amu * 0.9314941 GeV/amu = 5.601419 GeV.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor depends on the velocity (v) of the nucleus, which is given as 0.96c.\n\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28\n    *   γ = 3.57142857\n\n3.  **Calculate the total energy (E):**\n    Now, we multiply the Lorentz factor by the rest energy.\n\n    *   E = γ * E₀\n    *   E = 3.57142857 * 5.601419 GeV\n    *   E ≈ 20.0050 GeV\n\nRounding to the required precision, the energy is approximately 20.0050 GeV. Comparing this result to the provided options:\n\n*   A) 21.419 GeV\n*   B) 18.475 GeV\n*   C) 23.069 GeV\n*   D) 20.132 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of 20.0050 GeV is closest to 20.132 GeV. The minor discrepancy can arise from using slightly different values for physical constants. For instance, if we use a slightly different mass for the ⁶Li nucleus or a different conversion factor, the result changes. If we use the proton and neutron masses directly (mp ≈ 938.272 MeV/c², mn ≈ 939.565 MeV/c²) and account for the binding energy (around 32 MeV for ⁶Li), we arrive at a similar result. Let's re-calculate using the binding energy per nucleon for ⁶Li, which is about 5.332 MeV.\n\n*   Mass of 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 3 * 938.272 MeV + 3 * 939.565 MeV = 5633.511 MeV.\n*   Total binding energy = 6 nucleons * 5.332 MeV/nucleon = 31.992 MeV.\n*   Rest energy E₀ = 5633.511 MeV - 31.992 MeV = 5601.519 MeV = 5.601519 GeV.\n*   Total Energy E = γ * E₀ = 3.57142857 * 5.601519 GeV ≈ 20.0054 GeV.\n\nThis result is still closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
