    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a local, Poincar√©-invariant quantum field theory. This means all operators within SMEFT must respect the symmetries of spacetime, which are Lorentz symmetry (boosts and rotations) and translational symmetry. Together, these form the Poincare group. Therefore, both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries must be respected.\n\nCPT (Charge-Parity-Time) symmetry is a fundamental consequence of any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory. Since SMEFT adheres to these principles, it must also be CPT-invariant.\n\nCP (Charge-Parity) symmetry, however, is not a required symmetry for all SMEFT operators. The Standard Model itself contains sources of CP violation. SMEFT, as an extension, includes additional higher-dimensional operators that can provide new sources of CP violation. In fact, a significant area of research involves classifying and searching for these CP-violating operators.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are:\n1.  Lorentz Symmetry\n2.  Poincare symmetry\n4.  CPT symmetry\n\n<<<B>>>"
