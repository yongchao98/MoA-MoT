    "The problem of calculating the net potential energy of a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R can be solved using the method of images.\n\nHere's a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **The Method of Images**: The electric field outside the grounded conducting sphere is equivalent to the field produced by the original charge q and an \"image\" charge, q', placed at a specific location inside the sphere. The grounded sphere itself is considered to be at zero potential.\n\n2.  **Properties of the Image Charge**:\n    *   The image charge, q', has a magnitude of `-q(R/d)`.\n    *   It is located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center and the charge q.\n\n3.  **Potential Energy Calculation**: The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to the distance d. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force from the image charge.\n\n    The potential at the location of the charge q due to the image charge q' is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    where `k = 1 / (4πε₀)` is Coulomb's constant.\n\n    Substituting the values for q' and b:\n    `V_image = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_image = -k * qR / (d * (d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n    `V_image = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  **Work Done**: The potential energy of the charge q in the potential of the image charge is `U = q * V_image`. However, a crucial consideration is that the total energy stored in the field is half of the interaction energy between the charge and the image charge. This is because the induced charge distribution on the sphere also has self-energy. A detailed analysis shows that the total potential energy of the system is `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`.\n\n    Therefore, the net potential energy of the system is:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nC) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
