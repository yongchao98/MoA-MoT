    "Quantum field theories such as Quantum Chromodynamics and Quantum Electrodynamics require regularization to handle the infinities that arise in calculations, particularly at high energies. Classical Electrodynamics also faces a high-energy problem related to the infinite self-energy of point-like charges, which requires regularization.\n\nIn contrast, Superstring Theory is widely believed to be a UV-finite theory, meaning it does not suffer from these high-energy (ultraviolet) divergences. The fundamental objects in this theory are one-dimensional strings rather than point particles. This extended nature of strings is thought to smooth out interactions at very short distances (high energies), thus naturally avoiding the infinities that plague quantum field theories. As a result, Superstring Theory is not expected to require regularization for high-energy phenomena. While there isn't a complete formal proof for all cases, the evidence from perturbative calculations strongly supports its UV-finiteness.\n\n<<<B>>>"
