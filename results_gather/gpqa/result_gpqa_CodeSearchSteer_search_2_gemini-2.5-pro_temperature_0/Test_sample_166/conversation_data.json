    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the non-Gaussianity (nG) for the given Schrödinger cat state.\n\n### 1. Define the State and Parameters\n\nThe Schrödinger cat state is given by:\n|ψ⟩ = (cos(φ)|α⟩ + sin(φ)|-α⟩) / N\n\nThe parameters are:\n*   Phase (φ) = -π / 4\n*   Amplitude (α) = 0.5\n\n### 2. Simplify the State with the Given Parameters\n\nFirst, let's find the values of the trigonometric functions for φ = -π/4:\n*   cos(-π/4) = 1/√2\n*   sin(-π/4) = -1/√2\n*   sin(2 * -π/4) = sin(-π/2) = -1\n\nNow, substitute these into the state vector |ψ⟩. The state becomes a representation of an \"odd\" cat state:\n|ψ⟩ = ( (1/√2)|α⟩ - (1/√2)|-α⟩ ) / N = ( |α⟩ - |-α⟩ ) / (√2 * N)\n\nThe normalization constant N is:\nN = √[1 + sin(2φ) * exp(-2α²)] = √[1 - exp(-2α²)]\n\nSo, the density matrix ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ| is that of a pure state.\n\n### 3. Understand the Measure of Non-Gaussianity\n\nThe measure of non-Gaussianity is the quantum relative entropy between the state ρ and a reference Gaussian state τ. The formula for relative entropy is S(ρ || τ) = trace(ρ ln ρ) - trace(ρ ln τ).\n\nThe user provided the formula `del_b = [trace(ρ* ln(rho))-trace(tau* ln(tau))]`, which simplifies to `S(τ) - S(ρ)`.\n\nFor a pure state like |ψ⟩, the von Neumann entropy S(ρ) = -trace(ρ ln ρ) is zero. Therefore, the non-Gaussianity measure simplifies to the entropy of the reference Gaussian state, S(τ).\n\n### 4. Determine the Reference Gaussian State (τ)\n\nThe reference Gaussian state τ is chosen to have the same first and second moments as the state ρ.\n\n*   **First Moment (Displacement):** For the given state with φ = -π/4, the average displacement is zero. This means the state is centered, and the reference state τ will also be a centered Gaussian state.\n*   **Second Moment (Covariance Matrix):** For a centered state, the reference Gaussian state τ is a thermal state that has the same average photon number, ⟨n⟩, as ρ.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Average Photon Number (⟨n⟩)\n\nThe average photon number for the state |ψ⟩ is calculated as:\n⟨n⟩ = ⟨ψ|â† â|ψ⟩\n\nFor the specific case of φ = -π/4, this simplifies to:\n⟨n⟩ = α² * [1 + exp(-2α²)] / [1 - exp(-2α²)]\n\nNow, substitute α = 0.5:\n*   α² = 0.25\n*   exp(-2α²) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.60653\n\n⟨n⟩ = 0.25 * (1 + 0.60653) / (1 - 0.60653)\n⟨n⟩ = 0.25 * (1.60653) / (0.39347)\n⟨n⟩ ≈ 1.02076\n\n### 6. Calculate the Entropy of the Thermal State S(τ)\n\nThe von Neumann entropy of a thermal state τ with an average photon number ⟨n⟩ is given by the formula:\nS(τ) = (⟨n⟩ + 1) * ln(⟨n⟩ + 1) - ⟨n⟩ * ln(⟨n⟩)\n\nUsing the calculated value of ⟨n⟩ ≈ 1.02076:\n*   S(τ) = (1.02076 + 1) * ln(1.02076 + 1) - 1.02076 * ln(1.02076)\n*   S(τ) = 2.02076 * ln(2.02076) - 1.02076 * ln(1.02076)\n*   S(τ) ≈ 2.02076 * 0.70348 - 1.02076 * 0.02055\n*   S(τ) ≈ 1.42159 - 0.02098\n*   S(τ) ≈ 1.40061\n\nThis value is approximately 1.40.\n\n### 7. Final Answer\n\nThe calculated value of non-Gaussianity is approximately 1.40. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 1.38\nC) 2.48\nD) 0.25\n\nThe value 1.40 is closest to 1.38. The minor difference might arise from slight variations in physical constants or rounding in the problem's intended answer. Based on the calculation, 1.38 is the most plausible choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
