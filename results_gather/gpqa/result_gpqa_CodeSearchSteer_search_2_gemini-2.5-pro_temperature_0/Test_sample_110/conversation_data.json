    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Reactant Analysis and Enolate Formation**:\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. It's important to correctly identify the structure and the available α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The name `2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one` and `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethylcyclohexan-2-one` refer to the same molecule, just with different numbering schemes for the carbon ring. Let's analyze the structure based on the name that clarifies the reactive site.\n    *   Using the name `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethylcyclohexan-2-one`, the carbonyl group is at position C2. The α-carbons are C1 and C3.\n    *   C3 is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no α-protons.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only deprotonate the ketone at the C1 position. This removes any ambiguity about which enolate is formed.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition**:\n    *   The enolate formed at C1 will attack the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-COOEt`).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After protonation (typically from the solvent or during workup), the final product is formed.\n\n4.  **Product Identification**:\n    *   The resulting molecule has an ethyl propanoate group attached to the C1 position of the `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl` ring.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name for this product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the product A listed in options C and D.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the 1-nitropropane at the carbon alpha to the nitro group, creating a nucleophilic nitronate anion. This anion then attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n\n2.  **Reactant Analysis and Nucleophile Formation**:\n    *   The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the C1 of 1-nitropropane (`CH3-CH2-CH2-NO2`) to form the nitronate anion `[CH3-CH2-CH-NO2]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition**:\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`).\n    *   The new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane part and C3 of the butenenitrile part.\n\n4.  **Product Identification**:\n    *   The initial adduct is protonated by water to give the final product: `CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group is six carbons long, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering from the nitrile, we have a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the product B listed in options A and C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A** is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\n*   **Product B** is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option C contains both correct products.\n\n<<<C>>>"
