    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound X:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Product's NMR Spectra\n\nFirst, we must deduce the structure of the product formed in the reaction from the provided NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The starting material, Compound X, has the formula C11H12O. The reaction is with DABCO, which acts as a catalyst and is not incorporated into the final product. Therefore, the product also has the formula C11H12O.\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   A signal at **δ 197.7** is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), specifically a ketone.\n    *   Signals at **δ 21.3** and **δ 28.4** are in the aliphatic region, corresponding to two distinct methyl (CH₃) groups.\n    *   The remaining six signals are in the range of δ 126-145, which is typical for sp² hybridized carbons of aromatic rings and double bonds. The spectrum shows 8 carbons in this region (2C + 1C + 2C + 1C + 1C + 1C), which is consistent with a substituted benzene ring and a C=C double bond.\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   Two singlets at **δ 2.28 (3H)** and **δ 2.31 (3H)** confirm the presence of two methyl groups that are not adjacent to any protons.\n    *   The signals in the δ 6.7-7.8 region correspond to protons on a benzene ring and a double bond.\n    *   The pair of doublets at **δ 7.08 (2H)** and **δ 7.71 (2H)** is a classic pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two doublets at **δ 6.75 (1H)** and **δ 7.68 (1H)** are characteristic of two protons on a trans-substituted double bond (-CH=CH-).\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified (a ketone, two methyl groups, a para-substituted benzene ring, and a trans C=C double bond), the most plausible structure for the product (C11H12O) is **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n    *   **Structure:** p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃\n    *   This structure is consistent with all the NMR data. For instance, published spectral data for (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one shows:\n        *   ¹H NMR signals around δ 7.48 (d, 1H, vinylic), 7.43 (d, 2H, aromatic), 7.19 (d, 2H, aromatic), 6.66 (d, 1H, vinylic), 2.36 (s, 6H, two methyls). While the exact values differ slightly from the problem statement (which is common depending on solvent and instrument), the pattern of signals (two methyl singlets, two vinylic doublets, two aromatic doublets) is a clear match.\n        *   ¹³C NMR signals reported include δ 198.6 (C=O), 143.6, 141.1, 131.8, 129.8 (2C), 128.4 (2C), 27.5, 21.6. This again matches the types and general locations of the signals provided.\n\n### 2. Determine the Reaction and Identify Compound X\n\nThe reaction involves heating an epoxide (Compound X) with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), a non-nucleophilic base. This condition is known to promote the rearrangement of epoxides. Specifically, vinylic epoxides (where the epoxide ring is adjacent to a C=C double bond) can rearrange to form α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options for Compound X to see which one would yield (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one upon rearrangement.\n\n*   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This has a C₁₁H₁₂O formula. However, its rearrangement would likely produce 3-methyl-1-phenylbut-2-en-1-one, which does not match the product's NMR spectrum.\n*   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The structure is p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂. This compound has the correct formula, C₁₁H₁₂O. Base-catalyzed rearrangement of this vinylic epoxide would involve abstraction of the proton on the carbon that is both part of the epoxide and allylic to the styryl double bond. This leads directly to the formation of (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. This is a known type of transformation.\n*   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:** The formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which is incorrect.\n*   **D) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This has a C₁₁H₁₂O formula. Its rearrangement would lead to products like 1-phenylpent-1-en-3-one or 2-methyl-3-phenylpropenal, neither of which matches the product's NMR data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe product of the reaction is identified as (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one based on the provided NMR spectra. The only starting material, Compound X, that would form this product under the given reaction conditions (base-catalyzed epoxide rearrangement) is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<B>>>"
