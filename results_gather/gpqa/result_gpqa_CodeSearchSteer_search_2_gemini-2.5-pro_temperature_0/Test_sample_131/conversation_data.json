    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided 1H NMR Spectrum Data\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the two aromatic signals must come from protons that are equal in number. For example, two different 2H signals, or two different 1H signals that happen to have a 1:1 ratio due to the mixture.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### Evaluating Each Compound's Expected 1H NMR Spectrum\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they appear as a single **singlet** representing 2 hydrogens (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** representing 12 hydrogens (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two non-equivalent aromatic protons at positions 4 and 6. Neither has an adjacent proton, so they appear as two distinct **singlets**, each representing 1 hydrogen (1H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in three **singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent but are adjacent to each other. This ortho-coupling means they will split each other, appearing as a pair of doublets (an AB system), not singlets. This compound can be immediately ruled out as it does not produce singlets in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** It would show two singlets for the methyl groups (one for C1/C4 and one for C2/C3).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent and appear as a single **singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The signals for the ethyl groups would be a quartet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CH3, not singlets. This compound can also be ruled out.\n\n### Analyzing the Mixture Options\n\nBased on the individual spectra, only 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene produce only singlets in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions (ignoring the splitting in prehnitene and diethylbenzene). Let's examine the mixture described in option B.\n\n**Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene in a 1:1 mixture.**\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides two singlets (1H each).\n    *   The problem states there are only **two singlets in a 1:1 ratio**. This can happen if one of the 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has the same chemical shift as the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. This would result in one signal integrating to 3H (2H+1H) and the other integrating to 1H, giving a 3:1 ratio. This contradicts the given 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate. What if the two aromatic signals observed are the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and one of the aromatic protons from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, and the other proton from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is overlapping with one of the methyl signals? This is highly unlikely.\n    *   Let's reconsider the aromatic signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. They are two 1H singlets. And the signal from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene is one 2H singlet. For the mixture to show two aromatic signals in a 1:1 ratio, it implies that the total number of protons for each signal is the same. This would happen if the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene are the signals observed, and the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene is coincidentally overlapping with one of them. This would lead to a 3:1 ratio.\n    *   There must be a misunderstanding of the problem or a simplification. Let's re-examine the aliphatic region, which is often more definitive.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides three singlets (in a 6H:3H:3H ratio).\n    *   **Combined:** The spectrum is described as having three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This perfectly matches the signals from **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene alone**.\n    *   If the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, it should contribute a large 12H singlet. This would drastically alter the aliphatic region unless its signal overlaps perfectly with one of the signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n        *   Let's assume the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene overlaps with the 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The total integration would be (12H+6H) : 3H : 3H, which is an 18:3:3 or 6:1:1 ratio. This does not match.\n        *   Let's assume the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene overlaps with one of the 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The total integration would be 6H : (12H+3H) : 3H, which is a 6:15:3 or 2:5:1 ratio. This does not match.\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction in the problem statement as written. Let's reconsider the aromatic region. \"two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio\".\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the aliphatic ratio and re-evaluate the aromatic signals.\n*   **Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: 1 singlet (2H) from durene, 2 singlets (1H each) from isodurene.\n    *   If the 2H singlet from durene has a unique chemical shift, and the two 1H singlets from isodurene are also resolved, we would see three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   If the 2H singlet from durene overlaps with one of the 1H singlets from isodurene, we would see two signals with a 3:1 ratio.\n    *   If the two 1H singlets from isodurene have the same chemical shift (unlikely but possible), and this is different from the durene signal, we would see two signals with a 2H:2H or 1:1 ratio. Let's check if this is plausible. The two aromatic protons in isodurene are in slightly different environments, so their signals should be distinct.\n\nLet's reconsider the aliphatic region. \"three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\". This is the exact pattern for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene's methyl groups (6H:3H:3H). Where does the signal for 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene's methyl groups (12H) go? For the overall ratio to be 2:1:1, the 12H signal must be hidden or overlapping in a very specific way.\n\nLet's reconsider the question and options. There might be a simpler interpretation.\n\n*   **Aromatic:** Two singlets, 1:1 ratio.\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has two 1H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has one 2H signal (not a singlet).\n    *   If we mix **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**, we get a 2H singlet and a 2H non-singlet. This doesn't match.\n    *   If we mix **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**, we have a 2H singlet and two 1H singlets. This is three signals.\n    *   What if the question implies that the two compounds *together* create this pattern?\n\nLet's assume the two compounds are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n*   **Aromatic Protons:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB: 1 singlet (2H) at ~6.89 ppm.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB: 2 singlets (1H each).\n    *   The problem states two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This could mean the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB accidentally integrate to a 1:1 ratio. This is only possible if the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are coincidentally equivalent, giving a 2H singlet. Then we would have two 2H singlets, which is a 1:1 ratio. This is the most plausible explanation for the aromatic region.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB: 1 singlet (12H) at ~2.18 ppm.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB: 3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The problem states three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This is the exact pattern for the methyl groups of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This implies that the large 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene must be overlapping with one of the signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n    *   Let's assume the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB overlaps with the 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This would give three signals with integrals of (12+6)H : 3H : 3H, which is an 18:3:3 or 6:1:1 ratio. This does not match the 2:1:1 ratio given.\n\nThere is a clear contradiction in the problem statement. However, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, one must often find the \"best fit\" even if the data is imperfectly described.\n\nLet's re-evaluate from the start, assuming there is a correct answer among the options.\n*   Options A and C are ruled out because 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene does not give an aromatic singlet.\n*   Option D is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene gives a quartet and a triplet, not singlets, for its alkyl protons.\n\nThis leaves only **Option B** as a possibility. Let's try to reconcile the data with this option.\n*   **Compounds:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:** The problem states three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This is the signature of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene's methyl groups (6H:3H:3H). For this to be the observed ratio in a 1:1 mixture, the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene must be accounted for. The only way the 2:1:1 ratio is preserved is if the 12H signal from 1,2,4,5-TMB overlaps with the 6H signal from 1,2,3,5-TMB, and the problem statement has a typo in the ratio. For instance, if the ratio was 6:1:1, it would fit. Given the provided 2:1:1 ratio, there is a strong contradiction.\n*   **Aromatic Signals:** The problem states two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets.\n    *   For these to result in two singlets with a 1:1 ratio, the most likely scenario (within the constraints of a flawed question) is that the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are coincidentally degenerate (have the same chemical shift), creating a single 2H singlet. This, combined with the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB, would give two 2H singlets, resulting in a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**Conclusion based on best fit:**\nDespite the contradictions in the data (particularly the aliphatic ratio), Option B is the only one that contains compounds that could plausibly create the described signals (all singlets). The other options include compounds that fundamentally do not match the signal splitting (non-singlets). Therefore, assuming there are errors in the problem's description of the ratios, Option B is the only chemically sound choice.\n\nFinal check:\n- Aromatic: Two 2H singlets (1:1 ratio) is plausible if the two 1H protons in 1,2,3,5-TMB are accidentally equivalent in the NMR.\n- Aliphatic: Three singlets (2:1:1 ratio). This is the pattern for 1,2,3,5-TMB. The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB is problematic. However, if we must choose the best option, B is the only one that doesn't violate fundamental splitting rules.\n\n<<<B>>>"
