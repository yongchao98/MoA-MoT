    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of the orbital angular momentum ($L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$) of two electrons and finding the specific outcome where both yield an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the quantum state and the measurement process:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The system consists of two electrons, each in a p orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The system is in a specific coupled angular momentum state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. In this notation, $l$ is the total angular momentum quantum number and $m$ is the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Measurement**: A measurement is performed on the individual z-components of the angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The possible outcomes for a measurement of $L_z$ for a particle with angular momentum $l=1$ are the eigenvalues $m_l\\hbar$, where $m_l$ can be -1, 0, or 1.\n\n3.  **Desired Outcome**: We want to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ to be $-\\hbar$ (which corresponds to $m_{l1} = -1$) AND the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$ (which corresponds to $m_{l2} = -1$). This outcome corresponds to the uncoupled state $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle = |-1, -1\\rangle$.\n\nThe connection between the coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ and the uncoupled states $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$ is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The coupled state can be expressed as a linear combination (superposition) of the uncoupled states:\n$|l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_{l1}, m_{l2}} \\langle l_1, m_{l1}, l_2, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle |m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$\n\nA fundamental selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, $\\langle l_1, m_{l1}, l_2, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle$, is that they are zero unless the magnetic quantum numbers add up: $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = m$. This rule arises from the conservation of the z-component of the total angular momentum ($L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$).\n\nIn this problem, the system is in the state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$. Therefore, any uncoupled state $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$ that contributes to this superposition must satisfy $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1$. The possible combinations for $(m_{l1}, m_{l2})$ are (0, -1) and (-1, 0).\n\nWe are looking for the probability of finding the system in the state $|-1, -1\\rangle$. For this state, the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -2$ is not equal to the total magnetic quantum number of the system, $m = -1$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero.\n\nThe probability of measuring a specific uncoupled state is the square of the absolute value of its corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. Since the coefficient is zero, the probability is also zero. The state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ is not a component of the superposition that forms the state $|2, -1\\rangle$, and therefore, it is impossible to measure this outcome.\n\n<<<D>>>"
