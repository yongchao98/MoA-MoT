    "A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most often caused by the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This planarity gives the molecule a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this complex bicyclic compound includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS). These descriptors specify a particular three-dimensional arrangement at chiral centers. The naming of a specific, non-meso stereoisomer indicates that the compound is chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the substituents on both chiral carbons are identical (a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, and a carboxylic acid group). The (2R, 3S) configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry, which makes the molecule achiral despite the presence of chiral centers. This type of compound is known as a meso compound and is optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule and has a non-superimposable mirror image, the (2S,3S) enantiomer. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)*-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the (R) configuration at the first carbon atom (C1), which is a chiral center. The paths around the ring from C1 are different due to the double bond's position. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical activity.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)*-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound, also known as cis,cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, has its three hydroxyl (-OH) groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement creates multiple planes of symmetry in the molecule, for instance, a plane passing through one hydroxyl group and the opposite carbon atom. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure of this ketone is a cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon of a 3-methylbutanone chain. An analysis of the structure reveals no chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two methyl groups, and the rest of the molecule, so it is not chiral. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nIn summary, the following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, 3 of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>"
