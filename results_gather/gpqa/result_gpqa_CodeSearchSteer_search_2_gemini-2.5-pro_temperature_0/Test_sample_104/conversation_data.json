    "To determine the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same signal as the spotted star, we must first calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the star's rotation.\n\n### 1. Calculate the Flux Variation Due to Starspots\n\nThe brightness or flux (F) of a star is related to its effective temperature (Teff) by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, where flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (F ∝ T_eff⁴).\n\nThe star has two distinct hemispheres:\n*   An unspotted hemisphere with a uniform temperature of **T_star = 6000 K**.\n*   A spotted hemisphere where 20% of the area is covered by dark spots. The spots have a temperature of **T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K**. The remaining 80% of this hemisphere is at the star's normal temperature of 6000 K.\n\nThe maximum brightness (F_max) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to the star's temperature to the fourth power:\n**F_max ∝ T_star⁴ = 6000⁴**\n\nThe minimum brightness (F_min) occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is a weighted average of the spotted and unspotted areas on this hemisphere:\n**F_min ∝ (0.80 × T_star⁴) + (0.20 × T_spot⁴)**\n**F_min ∝ (0.80 × 6000⁴) + (0.20 × 5000⁴)**\n\nThe amplitude of the variation is the relative change in flux:\n**Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max**\n\nSubstituting the expressions for flux:\nAmplitude = (6000⁴ - [0.80 × 6000⁴ + 0.20 × 5000⁴]) / 6000⁴\nAmplitude = (0.20 × 6000⁴ - 0.20 × 5000⁴) / 6000⁴\nAmplitude = 0.20 × (1 - (5000⁴ / 6000⁴))\nAmplitude = 0.20 × (1 - (5/6)⁴)\nAmplitude = 0.20 × (1 - 625 / 1296)\nAmplitude = 0.20 × (671 / 1296)\n**Amplitude ≈ 0.10355**\n\n### 2. Equate to Exoplanet Transit Depth\n\nThe dimming caused by a transiting exoplanet is known as the transit depth. This depth is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n**Transit Depth = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π × R_pl²) / (π × R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²**\n\nTo produce the same signal, the transit depth must equal the amplitude calculated from the starspots:\n**(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude ≈ 0.10355**\n\n### 3. Solve for the Relative Radius\n\nFinally, we solve for the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius (R_pl / R_star):\n**R_pl / R_star = √0.10355**\n**R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218**\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<B>>>"
