    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Substance X and calculate the required atomic masses.\n\n### Identification of the Substances\n\n1.  **Substance B**: The melting point of B is stated to be very close to 277 K. This is approximately 3.85°C or 38.9°F. This value is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O).\n\n2.  **Substance X and its Isotope**: The presence of heavy water (D₂O) as a product strongly suggests that the heavier isotope in Substance X is deuterium (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n3.  **Organic Chemistry Context**: The problem states that Substance X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. It also mentions that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with two oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group. A powerful reducing agent would reduce both groups to alcohols, resulting in a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. A very common and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits the description of Substance X.\n\n4.  **Reaction with Liquid Y**: LiAlD₄ reacts violently with protic solvents like water. Let's test the reaction with heavy water (D₂O) as Liquid Y.\n    *   **Reaction**: LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂\n    *   **Gas W**: The gas released is deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium molecule (D₂) consists of two deuterons, each having 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, the molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, matching the description that the number of protons and neutrons are equal.\n    *   **Precipitate G**: The products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) and aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). While LiOD is soluble, Al(OD)₃ is insoluble and would form a precipitate.\n    *   **Heating G**: When aluminium hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) is heated, it decomposes to aluminium oxide and water. Similarly, heating aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) would release heavy water (B, D₂O).\n\nAll clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄). The phrasing \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\" is a key instruction.\n\n1.  **Elements in LiAlD₄**: The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n\n2.  **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**:\n    *   Based on atomic number and mass, Hydrogen is the lightest element, and Aluminium is the heaviest element.\n\n3.  **Summing the Masses**:\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen)**: There are four atoms of the lightest element, all of which are the deuterium isotope (D). The mass number of deuterium is 2. Therefore, the total mass contributed by the lightest element is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium)**: There is one atom of the heaviest element, Aluminium (Al). The mass number of the most common isotope of aluminium is 27.\n\n4.  **Cumulative Mass**: The cumulative mass is the sum of the total masses of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass of Hydrogen isotopes) + (Total mass of Aluminium isotopes)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThus, the cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>"
