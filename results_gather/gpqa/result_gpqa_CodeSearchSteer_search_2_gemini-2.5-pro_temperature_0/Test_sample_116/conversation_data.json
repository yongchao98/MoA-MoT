    "Here is an analysis of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule belongs to a class of compounds called biphenyls. Biphenyls can exhibit a special type of stereoisomerism known as atropisomerism, which is due to restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation occurs when there are bulky groups at the ortho positions (the positions next to the connecting bond). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate groups). This significant steric hindrance prevents the two rings from rotating freely, which can lead to two different, non-superimposable mirror-image forms (enantiomers). Therefore, this compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon in the propanoate chain) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is called a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images, called enantiomers, which are optically active. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. For a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Benzophenone possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, making it achiral. Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism. While individual benzophenone molecules are achiral, they can crystallize in a chiral form, but the molecule itself is not optically active in solution.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The double bond in the center of the molecule prevents free rotation. The molecule has a center of symmetry and is planar. Due to these symmetry elements, it is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. Its *cis*-isomer, dimethyl maleate, also has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
