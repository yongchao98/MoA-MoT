    "The user is asking for the molecular symmetry group of a product from a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\nThis is the nitration of toluene. The methyl group is an ortho, para-director. The major product, due to less steric hindrance, is p-nitrotoluene.\n*   Product 1: p-nitrotoluene\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, forming product 2.**\nThis is the oxidation of the methyl group of p-nitrotoluene. A mixture of manganese dioxide and sulfuric acid is a strong oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing an alkyl side chain on a benzene ring to a carboxylic acid.\n*   Product 2: p-nitrobenzoic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\nThis step involves the reaction of p-nitrobenzoic acid with acetone and a base (NaOH).\nFirst, the acidic carboxylic acid proton reacts with NaOH to form sodium p-nitrobenzoate.\nThe subsequent reaction is the reductive coupling of the nitro group. Aromatic nitro compounds can be reduced by agents like alcohols or ketones in the presence of a strong base to form azo or azoxy compounds. In this case, acetone acts as the reducing agent, and p-nitrobenzoate is reduced and dimerized. The likely product is the trans-azo compound, which is generally more stable than the cis isomer or the azoxy intermediate.\nThe reaction is:\n2 * p-NO₂-C₆H₄-COO⁻ + CH₃COCH₃ + NaOH → ⁻OOC-C₆H₄-N=N-C₆H₄-COO⁻ + oxidized acetone products + H₂O\n*   Product 3: trans-4,4'-azodibenzoate\n\n**Molecular Symmetry of Product 3**\nProduct 3 is trans-4,4'-azodibenzoate. We need to determine its point group.\n*   The trans-azobenzene core is known to be planar or nearly planar.\n*   Assuming a planar structure for the entire molecule, we can identify the symmetry elements.\n*   The molecule has a center of inversion (i) at the midpoint of the N=N double bond.\n*   It has a C₂ rotation axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and passing through the center of inversion.\n*   It has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that is coincident with the molecular plane.\n*   The presence of these elements (E, C₂, i, σh) defines the C₂h point group. The addition of the carboxylate groups at the para positions does not break this symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is C₂h.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) Cs: Incorrect. The molecule has more symmetry elements than just a single mirror plane.\nB) D2h: Incorrect. This would require two additional C₂ axes in the molecular plane, which are not present.\nC) C3: Incorrect. There is no 3-fold rotation axis.\nD) C2h: Correct. The molecule possesses a C₂ axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and a center of inversion.\n\n<<<D>>>"
