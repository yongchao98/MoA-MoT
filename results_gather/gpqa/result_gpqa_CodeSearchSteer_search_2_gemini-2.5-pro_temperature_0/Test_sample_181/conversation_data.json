    "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid under a specific set of assumptions. Analyzing these conditions helps to identify the correct statement.\n\nThe key assumptions for the Mott-Gurney law are:\n*   **Single-carrier device:** The model assumes that only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) is mobile and contributes to the current.\n*   **Trap-free solid:** The derivation assumes the semiconductor is ideal and does not contain any trap states that could capture charge carriers. The presence of traps would alter the current-voltage relationship.\n*   **Ohmic contacts:** The contacts must be \"Ohmic,\" meaning they can inject an unlimited supply of charge carriers into the semiconductor. This ensures that the current is limited by the charge transport properties of the material itself (the space charge) and not by the injection process at the contact. A barrier to injection, such as a Schottky contact, would violate this assumption.\n*   **Negligible diffusion current:** The equation is derived by considering only the drift current, which is the movement of charge carriers under the influence of the applied electric field. The diffusion current, which arises from gradients in carrier concentration, is assumed to be negligible.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on these principles:\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement aligns perfectly with all the core assumptions of the Mott-Gurney law. \"No carrier injection barrier\" is synonymous with an Ohmic contact.\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because the law is derived for single-carrier transport.\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This is incorrect. The space-charge-limited current is fundamentally a drift current. Neglecting it would imply no current flow.\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect. A Schottky contact creates an injection barrier, which violates the assumption of an Ohmic contact needed for space-charge-limited conditions.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that accurately describes the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
