    "An N-sided polygonal aperture where N is infinitely large and all apothems are of the same length 'a' is equivalent to a circular aperture with radius 'a'. When monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it produces a diffraction pattern known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\nThe angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function. The condition for the minima is given by the formula:\n\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = c * λ / D\n\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   D is the diameter of the circular aperture.\n*   c is a constant that depends on the order of the minimum.\n\nIn this problem, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle, so the diameter D = 2a.\n\nThe angular positions for the first two minima are:\n*   **First minimum (θ₁):** The constant 'c' is approximately 1.22.\n    θ₁ ≈ 1.22 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a\n*   **Second minimum (θ₂):** The constant 'c' for the second minimum is approximately 2.23.\n    θ₂ ≈ 2.23 * λ / (2a) = 1.115 * λ / a\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is the difference between their angular positions:\n\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ ≈ (1.115 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.505 * λ / a\n\nUsing more precise values for the minima positions (1.220 and 2.233) gives a difference of approximately 0.5065 λ / a. This value is closest to option B.\n\nTherefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<B>>>"
