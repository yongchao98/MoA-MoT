    "To determine the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in the solution, we need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n### 1. Understand the Equilibrium\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the reaction:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe given formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA) for this reaction is very large (5 x 10¹⁰), indicating that the complex is very stable and favors the product side.\n\nThe problem asks for the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions, which are produced by the dissociation of the complex. The dissociation is the reverse reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n### 2. Determine the Dissociation Constant (K_d)\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant (K_f).\n\n*   K_d = 1 / K_f\n*   K_d = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n*   K_d = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n### 3. Set Up an ICE Table\n\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that dissociates from the complex.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **[Ca-EDTA]²⁻** | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| **Ca²⁺** | 0 | +x | x |\n| **EDTA⁴⁻** | 0 | +x | x |\n\nThe problem assumes an ideal pH, which means we can use the absolute formation constant without correcting for pH effects on the EDTA species.\n\n### 4. Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve\n\nNow, we write the expression for the dissociation constant, K_d:\n\nK_d = ( [Ca²⁺] [EDTA⁴⁻] ) / [ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ]\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the expression:\n\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause K_d is extremely small, the extent of dissociation (x) will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make a simplifying assumption:\n\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nSolve for x²:\n\n*   x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n*   x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\nNow, solve for x, which represents the concentration of Ca²⁺:\n\n*   x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n*   x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n*   x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
