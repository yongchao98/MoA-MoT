    "To find the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition of the wave function. In quantum mechanics, the total probability of finding a particle in all possible locations must be equal to 1. This is expressed mathematically by integrating the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |ψ(x)|², over all space where the particle can exist and setting the result to 1.\n\nThe given wave function is:\nψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe problem states that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the normalization integral will be over this interval.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |ψ(x)|². For a complex function ψ = Re + i*Im, the squared magnitude is |ψ|² = Re² + Im².\nIn this case:\n*   The real part is Re(ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n*   The imaginary part is Im(ψ) = -0.5\n\nSo, the squared magnitude is:\n|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nNext, we set up the normalization integral and solve for \"a\":\n∫¹³ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫¹³ 0.25 dx = 1\n\nSolving the first part:\na² ∫¹³ (1 / (1 + x)) dx = a² [ln(1 + x)]¹³\n= a² (ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1))\n= a² (ln(4) - ln(2))\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n= a² ln(4/2)\n= a² ln(2)\n\nSolving the second part:\n∫¹³ 0.25 dx = [0.25x]¹³\n= 0.25 * 3 - 0.25 * 1\n= 0.75 - 0.25\n= 0.5\n\nNow, we substitute these results back into the equation:\na² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nNow, we solve for \"a\":\na² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the value of ln(2) ≈ 0.693147:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693147\na² ≈ 0.7213475\na ≈ √0.7213475\na ≈ 0.84932\n\nThis value is approximately 0.85.\n\n<<<A>>>"
