    "To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle X⁰, we must first calculate the average distance the particle travels in the bubble chamber before it decays. This requires a few steps based on the principles of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe Lorentz factor, γ, relates the energy of a particle to its rest mass and is a measure of the relativistic effects. It is calculated as the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest energy (m₀c²).\n\nGiven:\n*   Total energy (E) = 27 GeV\n*   Rest mass (m₀) = 3.41 GeV/c²\n\nThe Lorentz factor is:\nγ = E / (m₀c²) = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV = 7.918\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Mean Decay Length (L)\nThe proper lifetime (τ₀) is the lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. In the laboratory frame (the bubble chamber), the particle's lifetime (τ) is dilated due to its high speed, a phenomenon known as time dilation. The observed lifetime is τ = γτ₀.\n\nThe mean decay length (L) is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. For a highly relativistic particle, its velocity (v) is very close to the speed of light (c). The decay length can be calculated more precisely using the formula L = c * τ₀ * √(γ² - 1).\n\nGiven:\n*   Proper lifetime (τ₀) = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s\n*   Speed of light (c) ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   Lorentz factor (γ) ≈ 7.918\n\nL = (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s) * √(7.918² - 1)\nL ≈ (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m) * √(62.69 - 1)\nL ≈ (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m) * √(61.69)\nL ≈ (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m) * 7.854\nL ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Minimum Resolution (d)\nThe problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. For a decay to be \"observed,\" the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution, `d`. The probability that a particle survives to travel at least a distance `d` follows an exponential decay law: P(l ≥ d) = e^(-d/L).\n\nWe are given that this probability must be at least 30%:\ne^(-d/L) = 0.30\n\nTo solve for `d`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n-d/L = ln(0.30)\nd = -L * ln(0.30)\nd ≈ -(1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204)\nd ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated minimum resolution is approximately 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ meters. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) 2.08 × 10⁻⁹ m\nB) 2.08 × 10⁻¹ m\nC) 2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m\nD) 2.08 × 10⁻³ m\n\nThe value 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m is closest in magnitude and order to option C. The slight numerical difference may be due to rounding of constants or a minor inaccuracy in the problem statement's values. Therefore, the most plausible answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
