    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂):\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n    Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio**:\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law relates a star's temperature (T) to the rest-frame wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (λ_rest_max):\n        λ_rest_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant.\n        This implies that T is inversely proportional to λ_rest_max. So, the temperature ratio is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = λ_rest_max₂ / λ_rest_max₁\n\n    *   **Doppler Effect**: The problem states that the radial velocity of Star_2 is v₂ = 700 km/s, while Star_1 is stationary (v₁ = 0). This velocity causes a Doppler shift in the observed wavelength. The problem also states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs_max₁ = λ_obs_max₂).\n        The relationship between the observed wavelength (λ_obs) and the rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest) for a velocity much smaller than the speed of light (c) is:\n        λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c)\n\n    *   For Star_1 (v₁ = 0): λ_obs_max₁ = λ_rest_max₁\n    *   For Star_2 (v₂ = 700 km/s): λ_obs_max₂ = λ_rest_max₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\n    *   Since λ_obs_max₁ = λ_obs_max₂, we have:\n        λ_rest_max₁ = λ_rest_max₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\n    *   Now we can find the ratio of the rest-frame wavelengths:\n        λ_rest_max₂ / λ_rest_max₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Now substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n\n    Let's plug in the values:\n    *   v₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   v₂/c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.002333)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00937\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
