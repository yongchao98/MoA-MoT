    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Assume a Value for Each Letter:** The most direct approach for this type of problem is to assume that each letter (A, C, G, T) corresponds to a numerical value. The value of the entire sequence is the sum of the values of its letters.\n\n2.  **Formulate Equations from Examples:**\n    *   For the input `AGG`, the letter counts are A=1, G=2. This gives the equation:\n        `1*A + 2*G = 115`  (Equation 1)\n    *   For the input `TGCTGA`, the letter counts are T=2, G=2, C=1, A=1. This gives the equation:\n        `1*A + 1*C + 2*G + 2*T = 176` (Equation 2)\n\n3.  **Simplify the System of Equations:**\n    *   Notice that the term `1*A + 2*G` from Equation 1 also appears in Equation 2.\n    *   We can substitute the value from Equation 1 into Equation 2:\n        `(1*A + 2*G) + 1*C + 2*T = 176`\n        `115 + C + 2*T = 176`\n    *   Now, simplify to find a relationship between C and T:\n        `C + 2*T = 176 - 115`\n        `C + 2*T = 61` (Equation 3)\n\n4.  **Formulate the Query Equation:**\n    *   The question asks for the value of the sequence `ACAGTGACC`.\n    *   First, count the letters in this sequence: A=3, C=3, G=2, T=1.\n    *   The value to find (let's call it `Q`) is:\n        `Q = 3*A + 3*C + 2*G + 1*T`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Query Value:**\n    *   The system of equations (`A + 2G = 115` and `C + 2T = 61`) is underdetermined, meaning there isn't a single unique value for each letter. However, the value of the specific combination `Q` can be uniquely determined.\n    *   We can find a set of integer values that satisfies the equations. For instance:\n        *   From `C + 2T = 61`, if we choose `T=1`, then `C=59`.\n        *   From `A + 2G = 115`, if we choose `A=11`, then `2G = 104`, so `G=52`.\n    *   This gives a valid set of values: `A=11`, `C=59`, `G=52`, `T=1`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   Substitute these values into the query equation `Q`:\n        `Q = 3*(11) + 3*(59) + 2*(52) + 1*(1)`\n        `Q = 33 + 177 + 104 + 1`\n        `Q = 210 + 104 + 1`\n        `Q = 314 + 1`\n        `Q = 315`\n\nTo confirm the result is unique, we can try another set of values. For example, `A=1`, `G=57`, `C=67`, `T=-3`.\n`Q = 3*(1) + 3*(67) + 2*(57) + 1*(-3) = 3 + 201 + 114 - 3 = 315`.\nThe result is the same, confirming that the value of the expression is independent of the specific solution chosen for the individual letters.\n\nThe value for `ACAGTGACC` is 315.\n\n<<<B>>>"
