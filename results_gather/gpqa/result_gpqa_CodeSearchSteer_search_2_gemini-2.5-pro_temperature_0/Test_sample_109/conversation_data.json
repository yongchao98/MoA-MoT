    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n### **Observatory Criteria**\n\nFirst, let's establish the observation criteria for each instrument:\n\n*   **ESPRESSO (Paranal Observatory, Chile):**\n    *   Location: Southern Hemisphere (Latitude ~24.6° S). It can observe stars with a declination (DEC) south of approximately +65°.\n    *   Magnitude Limit: Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m) brighter than 17 (i.e., m < 17).\n\n*   **HIRES (W. M. Keck Observatory, Hawaii):**\n    *   Location: Northern Hemisphere (Latitude ~19.8° N). It can observe stars with a declination (DEC) north of approximately -70°.\n    *   Magnitude Limit: Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m) brighter than 16 (i.e., m < 16).\n\nA star must meet both the location (declination) and magnitude requirements for both observatories to be detectable by both.\n\n### **Star-by-Star Analysis**\n\nThe key formulas to calculate the apparent magnitude (m) from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d), and to account for interstellar absorption (A_V), are:\n1.  `m = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5`\n2.  `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`\n3.  Observed magnitude = `m + A_V`\n\n---\n\n**Star1**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** -75°\n*   **Observability:**\n    *   Paranal (S. Hemi): Observable.\n    *   Keck (N. Hemi): **Not observable**, as -75° is south of its -70° limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both instruments.\n\n---\n\n**Star2**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** +55°\n*   **Observability:**\n    *   Paranal (S. Hemi): Observable, as +55° is south of its +65° limit.\n    *   Keck (N. Hemi): Observable, as +55° is north of its -70° limit.\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude (m):** 16.5 mag\n*   **Magnitude Check:**\n    *   ESPRESSO (m < 17): 16.5 is brighter than 17. **OK.**\n    *   HIRES (m < 16): 16.5 is **not** brighter than 16. **FAIL.**\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both instruments.\n\n---\n\n**Star3**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** +48°\n*   **Observability:**\n    *   Paranal (S. Hemi): Observable.\n    *   Keck (N. Hemi): Observable.\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude (m):** 15.5 mag. The term \"apparent magnitude\" typically refers to the brightness as seen from Earth, including any dimming from dust. The additional information about color excess and distance is likely extraneous.\n*   **Magnitude Check:**\n    *   ESPRESSO (m < 17): 15.5 is brighter than 17. **OK.**\n    *   HIRES (m < 16): 15.5 is brighter than 16. **OK.**\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable by both instruments.**\n\n---\n\n**Star4**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** -48°\n*   **Observability:**\n    *   Paranal (S. Hemi): Observable.\n    *   Keck (N. Hemi): Observable.\n*   **Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   Absolute Magnitude (M) = 15.5 mag, Distance (d) = 10 pc.\n    *   Apparent magnitude without absorption: `m = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 = 15.5 mag`.\n    *   Absorption (A_V): `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag`.\n    *   Observed Apparent Magnitude: `15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag`.\n*   **Magnitude Check:**\n    *   ESPRESSO (m < 17): 16.74 is brighter than 17. **OK.**\n    *   HIRES (m < 16): 16.74 is **not** brighter than 16. **FAIL.**\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both instruments.\n\n---\n\n**Star5**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** +60°\n*   **Observability:**\n    *   Paranal (S. Hemi): Observable.\n    *   Keck (N. Hemi): Observable.\n*   **Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   Absolute Magnitude (M) = 16.5 mag, Distance (d) = 5 pc.\n    *   Observed Apparent Magnitude: `m = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 5 * (0.70) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.5 - 5 = 15.0 mag`.\n*   **Magnitude Check:**\n    *   ESPRESSO (m < 17): 15.0 is brighter than 17. **OK.**\n    *   HIRES (m < 16): 15.0 is brighter than 16. **OK.**\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable by both instruments.**\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe analysis shows that Star3 and Star5 are observable from both locations and are bright enough to be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n<<<D>>>"
