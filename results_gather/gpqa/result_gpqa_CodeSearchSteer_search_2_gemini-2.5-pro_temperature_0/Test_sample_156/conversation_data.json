    "The correct approach to designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a quick detection of a new retrovirus is outlined in option C.\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\n\n**C) First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing. You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.**\n\nThis option presents the most scientifically sound and modern approach for several key reasons:\n\n1.  **Nature of a Retrovirus:** A retrovirus has an RNA genome, not a DNA genome. To analyze its genetic sequence, the RNA must first be converted into a stable DNA copy. This is done using an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, and the resulting DNA is known as complementary DNA (cDNA). Therefore, performing cDNA sequencing is the correct initial step to identify and characterize the genetic makeup of a new retrovirus.\n\n2.  **Identification is Key:** Before any diagnostic test can be designed, the exact genetic sequence of the new pathogen must be determined. cDNA sequencing, often as part of next-generation sequencing (NGS), allows researchers to obtain the full or partial genome of the novel virus. This sequence information is crucial for designing the specific components of a diagnostic kit.\n\n3.  **Real-Time PCR for Diagnosis:** Once the viral sequence is known, a real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR or real-time RT-PCR) assay can be developed. This is the gold standard for rapid and accurate viral detection. It is highly sensitive, meaning it can detect very small amounts of the virus, and highly specific, because it uses custom-designed primers and probes that only bind to the target retrovirus's genetic sequence. The \"real-time\" aspect allows for the detection and quantification of the virus as the reaction happens, providing results in hours rather than days.\n\n### Why Other Options Are Incorrect:\n\n*   **A) First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.**\n    *   Identifying a virus based on symptoms alone is unreliable for designing a molecular test. Many different viruses can cause similar symptoms. To design a PCR test, you need the precise genetic sequence, which symptoms cannot provide.\n\n*   **B) First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick and accurate diagnosis.**\n    *   This describes a serological test, not a molecular diagnostic test. It detects the body's immune response (antibodies) to the virus, not the virus itself. Furthermore, IgG antibodies typically appear later in the course of an infection and can persist for a long time, making them better for determining past exposure rather than diagnosing an active, early-stage infection. For quick diagnosis during an outbreak, detecting the virus's genetic material is more effective.\n\n*   **D) First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.**\n    *   This is incorrect because a retrovirus is an RNA virus. It does not have a DNA genome that can be directly sequenced. The essential first step of reverse transcription to create cDNA is missing from this option.\n\n<<<C>>>"
