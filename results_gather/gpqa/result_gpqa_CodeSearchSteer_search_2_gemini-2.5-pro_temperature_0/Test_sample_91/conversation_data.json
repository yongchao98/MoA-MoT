    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound, we can use the provided bond energies and enthalpy of atomization of carbon. The process involves three main steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the total energy required to form the gaseous atoms** of the elements from their standard states.\n2.  **Calculate the total energy released when forming the molecule** from its gaseous atoms (which is the negative of the enthalpy of atomization of the compound).\n3.  **Combine these values** using Hess's Law to find the overall enthalpy of formation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count**\n\nThe molecule is (CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Counting the atoms gives C₁₂H₂₂.\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   There are 22 C-H single bonds.\n    *   There are 9 C-C single bonds.\n    *   There are 2 C=C double bonds.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation of Gaseous Atoms**\n\nWe need to find the enthalpy change for the reaction: 12 C(s) + 11 H₂(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g).\n\n*   **For Carbon:** The enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol.\n    *   Energy to form 12 moles of C(g) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   **For Hydrogen:** The bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol. This is the energy to break one mole of H₂ into 2 moles of H atoms. We need 22 moles of H atoms, which come from 11 moles of H₂.\n    *   Energy to form 22 moles of H(g) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements:** 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound.\n\n*   **Energy to break C-C bonds:** 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol.\n*   **Energy to break C=C bonds:** 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol.\n*   **Energy to break C-H bonds:** 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol.\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Compound:** 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy of atomization of the elements minus the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n\n*   ΔH_f = (Total enthalpy for atomization of elements) - (Total enthalpy for atomization of compound)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol.\n\n**Step 5: Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options include answers in kJ/g. We need to convert our result.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C₁₂H₂₂:** (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   **Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g:** (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.445 kJ/g.\n\nThis value is extremely close to option C.\n\n*   A) 1900 kJ/g (Incorrect unit)\n*   B) 67.4 kJ/mol (Incorrect value)\n*   C) 11.44 kJ/g (Matches calculation)\n*   D) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not its formation)\n\n<<<C>>>"
