    "The search results confirm the principles I used.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy and Momentum:** Annihilation processes must conserve total energy and momentum.\n2.  **Proton Rest Mass Energy:** The rest energy of a proton is consistently cited as approximately 938.3 MeV. I will use this value for the calculation.\n3.  **Annihilation at Rest:** The term \"slowly moving\" implies the initial kinetic energy is negligible. This is consistent with the concept of \"annihilation at rest,\" where the initial energy is dominated by the rest mass of the particles. In this scenario, the total initial momentum is considered to be zero.\n\nThe calculation steps remain the same:\n\n1.  **Initial State:**\n    *   Particles: 1 proton ($p$) and 1 antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   Assumption: Both are effectively at rest, so their kinetic energy is zero.\n    *   Total Initial Energy ($E_i$): $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$.\n    *   Using $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3$ MeV.\n    *   $E_i = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Total Initial Momentum ($P_i$): $P_i = 0$.\n\n2.  **Final State:**\n    *   Particles: 2 $A^+$ and 2 $A^-$. A total of 4 particles of mass $m_A$.\n    *   Rest mass of A: $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n    *   From momentum conservation, the total final momentum must be zero. The most symmetric configuration is that all four particles have the same speed ($v$) and thus the same total energy ($E_A$).\n    *   Total Final Energy ($E_f$): $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy ($E_i = E_f$):**\n    *   $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n    *   $1876.6 = 1200 \\gamma$\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n4.  **Calculate Velocity (v):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n    *   Rearranging for $v/c$: $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$.\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n    *   $v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The calculated velocity is approximately $0.77c$. This matches option D.\n\nThe logic is sound and confirmed by the search results. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nHere is a summary of the calculation:\n*   **Initial Energy**: The process starts with a proton and a slowly moving antiproton. Assuming they are effectively at rest, the initial energy is the sum of their rest energies. The rest energy of a proton is approximately 938.3 MeV.\n    $E_{initial} = E_{proton} + E_{antiproton} = 2 \\times m_{p}c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n*   **Final Energy**: The annihilation produces four particles of type A (two positive, two negative), each with a rest mass energy of $m_{A}c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$. The total energy of these four particles must equal the initial energy. Since the initial momentum is zero, the four final particles must have equal speeds and energies to conserve momentum.\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_{A} = 4 \\times \\gamma m_{A}c^2$.\n*   **Conservation of Energy**: By equating the initial and final energies:\n    $1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\, \\text{MeV})$\n    $1876.6 = 1200 \\gamma$\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.564$\n*   **Velocity Calculation**: The velocity is found from the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{1.564^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.408} = \\sqrt{0.592} \\approx 0.769$\n*   **Result**: The velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
