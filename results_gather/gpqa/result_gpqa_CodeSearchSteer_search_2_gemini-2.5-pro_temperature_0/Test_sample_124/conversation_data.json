    "The quantum mechanical system described is a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for this system are given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega$\nwhere $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number, and $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers.\n\n*   The ground state corresponds to n = 0 ($n_x=n_y=n_z=0$). Energy: $E_0 = (3/2) \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   The first excited state corresponds to n = 1. Energy: $E_1 = (1 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (5/2) \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   The second excited state corresponds to n = 2. Energy: $E_2 = (2 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (7/2) \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   The third excited state corresponds to n = 3. Energy: $E_3 = (3 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (9/2) \\hbar \\omega$.\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level is its degeneracy. The degeneracy, $g_n$, for the n-th energy level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n$g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$.\n\nFor the third excited state, n = 3. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n$g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10$.\n\nThis degeneracy can also be found by counting the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ that sum to 3:\n*   (3, 0, 0) and its permutations: 3 states\n*   (2, 1, 0) and its permutations: 6 states\n*   (1, 1, 1): 1 state\nTotal degeneracy = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10.\n\n<<<B>>>"
