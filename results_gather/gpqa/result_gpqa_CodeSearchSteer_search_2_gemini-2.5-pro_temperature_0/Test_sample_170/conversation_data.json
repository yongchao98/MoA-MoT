    "### Analysis of Substituent Effects on Electrophilic Bromination\n\nTo arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must first classify the substituents on the benzene ring. These substituents determine the reaction's regioselectivity, directing the incoming bromine to specific positions (ortho, meta, or para).\n\n**1. Classification of Substituents:**\n\nThe substituents are classified based on their electronic effects (activating or deactivating) and their directing influence (ortho/para or meta).\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the benzene ring, making it more reactive. They direct the electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-CH₃ (Toluene, 1):** Alkyl group, activating.\n    *   **-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene, 5):** Alkyl group, activating.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** Halogens are electron-withdrawing via induction (deactivating) but can donate electrons via resonance, which directs substitution to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** Halogen, deactivating.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw significant electron density from the ring, making it less reactive and directing the electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene, 4):** Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **-COOH (Benzoic acid, 6):** Deactivating.\n    *   **-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** Deactivating.\n\n**2. Isomer Distribution and Para-Yield:**\n\nThe percentage of the para-isomer formed depends on the nature of the substituent.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Substances 4, 2, 6):** For nitrobenzene (4), ethyl benzoate (2), and benzoic acid (6), the primary product is the meta-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer is consequently very low. For instance, the nitration of ethyl benzoate yields only 5% of the para-isomer, with the majority being the meta-product (73%). Similarly, the bromination of nitrobenzene almost exclusively produces the meta-isomer. Therefore, these three substances will have the lowest para-isomer yields. Among these, the deactivating strength generally follows the order -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅, which correlates with lower ortho/para substitution. Thus, the para yield order is expected to be 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n*   **Ortho/Para-Directors (Substances 1, 5, 3):** For toluene (1), ethylbenzene (5), and chlorobenzene (3), the substitution occurs at the ortho and para positions. The ratio between ortho and para products is influenced by steric hindrance.\n    *   **-CH₃ and -C₂H₅:** Alkyl groups are ortho/para directors. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric hindrance around the ortho positions in ethylbenzene favors substitution at the less hindered para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) is expected to have a higher para-isomer yield than toluene (1). For example, in nitration, toluene gives 37% para-product, while the more sterically hindered tert-butylbenzene gives 75% para-product.\n    *   **-Cl:** The chloro group is also an ortho/para director. Halogens typically yield a high percentage of the para-isomer due to a combination of electronic and steric factors. For example, the nitration of chlorobenzene results in 70% para-product. In bromination, chlorobenzene shows high selectivity for the para position, with yields over 95% under certain conditions. This strong preference for the para position is generally higher than for simple alkylbenzenes.\n\n**3. Final Ordering:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can establish the order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n\n1.  **Lowest Yields (Meta-Directors):** The deactivating, meta-directing groups will produce the smallest amount of the para-isomer. The order among them, from lowest to highest para yield, is generally accepted as: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n2.  **Intermediate Yields (Ortho/Para-Directors):** The activating alkyl groups will produce significant amounts of para-isomer. Due to less steric hindrance, toluene (1) will have a lower para-to-ortho ratio compared to the bulkier ethylbenzene (5). Thus, the order is Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n3.  **Highest Yield (Ortho/Para-Director):** The chloro group in chlorobenzene (3) strongly directs substitution to the para position, often with very high selectivity, surpassing that of the alkylbenzenes.\n\nCombining these groups, the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
