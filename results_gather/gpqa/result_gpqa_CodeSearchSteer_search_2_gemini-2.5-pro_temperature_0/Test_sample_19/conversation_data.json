    "The impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations is based on a set of simplifying assumptions about how a probe (like an electron or neutrino) interacts with a nucleus. Analyzing the provided options reveals the core tenets of this approximation.\n\nThe key assumptions are:\n\n1.  **The interaction involves only one nucleon:** The complex interaction with the A-nucleon system is treated as an incoherent sum of interactions with individual nucleons. This is often referred to as the one-body current assumption. The remaining (A-1) nucleons are considered spectators.\n\n2.  **The struck nucleon is treated as a free particle:** The interaction is assumed to occur over a very short time. During this brief period, the effects of the potential that binds the nucleon to the rest of the nucleus are considered negligible. This \"neglect-of-binding\" is a central part of the impulse approximation.\n\n3.  **There are no final-state interactions:** After the interaction, the ejected nucleon is assumed to exit the nucleus without any further interactions with the remaining nucleons. This is also known as the \"plane wave\" assumption, and when combined with the other points, it forms the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA). This implies the nucleus is effectively transparent to the outgoing particle.\n\nBased on this, the assumptions from the list that jointly define the impulse approximation are:\n\n*   **1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the fundamental principle of reducing the many-body problem to a single-body one.\n*   **2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This is the \"no final-state interactions\" assumption, crucial for the simplified PWIA.\n*   **4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the \"neglect-of-binding\" hypothesis, where the nucleon is treated as free during the collision.\n\nAssumption 3, regarding the non-relativistic nature of quarks, pertains to the internal structure of the nucleon itself, not its behavior within the nucleus during a scattering event. The impulse approximation simplifies the nuclear many-body problem, treating nucleons as the fundamental entities, and does not inherently depend on a model of their quark substructure.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
