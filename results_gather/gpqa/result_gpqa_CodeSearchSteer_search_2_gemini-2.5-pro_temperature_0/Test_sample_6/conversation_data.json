    "To determine the energy at which high-energy gamma-rays ($\\gamma$) have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, we need to calculate the threshold energy for the pair production process $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$.\n\n### 1. Physical Principle\n\nThe creation of an electron-positron pair from two photons is governed by the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of four-momentum. The threshold energy is the minimum energy required for this reaction to occur. This minimum energy corresponds to the case where the electron and positron are created with no excess kinetic energy in the center-of-mass frame.\n\nFor the reaction to happen, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least the rest energy of the electron-positron pair, which is $2m_e c^2$, where $m_e$ is the rest mass of an electron and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n### 2. Threshold Energy Calculation\n\nLet $E_\\gamma$ be the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray and $E_{CMB}$ be the energy of the CMB photon. The condition for pair production at the threshold for a head-on collision (which requires the minimum energy for the high-energy photon) is given by the equation:\n\n$E_\\gamma E_{CMB} = (m_e c^2)^2$\n\nFrom this, we can solve for the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray, $E_\\gamma$:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n### 3. Necessary Values\n\nTo perform the calculation, we need the following values:\n*   **Rest energy of an electron ($m_e c^2$)**: This is a fundamental physical constant. Its value is approximately 0.511 MeV.\n*   **Average energy of a CMB photon ($E_{CMB}$)**: This is given in the problem as $10^{-3}$ eV.\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nFirst, let's express all energy values in the same unit, electron volts (eV).\n\n*   $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n*   $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the equation for $E_\\gamma$:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511^2 \\times (10^6)^2) \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} \\text{ eV}$\n\n$E_\\gamma = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question provides the options in Giga-electron volts (GeV), so we need to convert our result.\n*   $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{15}}{10^9} \\text{ GeV}$\n\n$E_\\gamma = 0.261121 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis can be written as $2.61121 \\times 10^5$ GeV.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nComparing our calculated value with the given options:\nA) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\nB) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\nC) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\nD) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\n\nThe calculated energy of approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV matches option A. Therefore, gamma-rays with energies around this value would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by pair production with CMB photons.\n\n<<<A>>>"
