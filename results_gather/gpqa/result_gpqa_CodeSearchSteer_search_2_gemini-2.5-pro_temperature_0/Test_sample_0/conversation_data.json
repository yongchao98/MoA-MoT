    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the inherent uncertainty, or \"width,\" of each level. This energy width is fundamentally linked to the lifetime of the state by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\nThe relationship is given by the formula ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the lifetime of the state, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). A shorter lifetime leads to a larger uncertainty in the energy, resulting in a broader energy level.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state:\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime (τ₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width (ΔE₁) ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime (τ₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width (ΔE₂) ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo resolve the two levels, the energy separation between them must be significantly larger than the broader of the two energy widths. The first state has the shorter lifetime and therefore the larger energy width of about 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nNow, we compare this required separation with the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, as it is several orders of magnitude greater than the natural linewidth of either state.\n\n<<<D>>>"
