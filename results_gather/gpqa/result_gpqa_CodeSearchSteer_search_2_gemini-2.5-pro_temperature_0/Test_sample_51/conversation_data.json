    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem asks for the change in the ratio of the populations of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in a star's photosphere at two different temperatures. Under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the population of atoms in different energy states is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two energy levels, an upper level (u) and a lower level (l), is given by:\n    N_u / N_l = (g_u / g_l) * exp(-(E_u - E_l) / (k * T))\n    where:\n    *   g_u and g_l are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   E_u and E_l are the energies of the levels.\n    *   ΔE = E_u - E_l is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Define the Ratio:** The problem states that \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) ... decreases when the star has spots\". Spots cause the temperature to decrease (from T_nospots = 6000 K to T_spots = 5500 K).\n    Let's analyze how the ratio N_u / N_l behaves as temperature (T) decreases:\n    *   As T decreases, 1/T increases.\n    *   This makes the negative exponent -(ΔE / kT) less negative (i.e., it increases).\n    *   Therefore, exp(-(ΔE / kT)) increases.\n    *   This means the ratio N_u / N_l *increases* as temperature decreases.\n\n    This contradicts the problem's observation. Let's consider the inverse ratio, R = N_l / N_u:\n    R = N_l / N_u = (g_l / g_u) * exp(ΔE / (k * T))\n    *   As T decreases, 1/T increases.\n    *   The exponent (ΔE / kT) increases.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio N_l / N_u *increases* as temperature decreases.\n\n    There seems to be a misunderstanding in the premise. Let's re-read: \"the ratio ... decreases when the star has spots\". This means the ratio is smaller at the lower temperature (T_spots).\n    Let's re-examine the first ratio, R = N_u / N_l.\n    R(T) = C * exp(-ΔE / (kT)), where C is the constant ratio of statistical weights.\n    *   At T_nospots = 6000 K, R_nospots = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * 6000)).\n    *   At T_spots = 5500 K, R_spots = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * 5500)).\n    Since 5500 < 6000, then 1/5500 > 1/6000, and -1/5500 < -1/6000.\n    Therefore, exp(-ΔE / (k * 5500)) < exp(-ΔE / (k * 6000)), which means R_spots < R_nospots. This matches the problem's description. So, the ratio in question is indeed the population of the upper energy level to the lower energy level.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy of a photon for the transition is related to its wavelength (λ) by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n    ΔE = h * c / λ\n    where:\n    *   h is the Planck constant (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n    *   c is the speed of light (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s).\n    *   λ is the wavelength, 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n\n    ΔE = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s) / (1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m) ≈ 1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Factor:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes, which is the ratio of the ratios:\n    Factor = Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots\n    Factor = [C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))] / [C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))]\n    Factor = exp[(-ΔE/k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots)]\n    Factor = exp[(ΔE/k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots)]\n\n    Now, let's plug in the values:\n    *   ΔE ≈ 1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J\n    *   k = 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   T_spots = 5500 K\n    *   T_nospots = 6000 K\n\n    First, calculate the term ΔE/k:\n    ΔE/k ≈ (1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J) / (1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 99420 K.\n\n    Now, calculate the temperature term:\n    (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) = 500 / 33,000,000 = 1 / 66,000 K⁻¹.\n\n    Finally, compute the factor:\n    Factor = exp[99420 * (1 / 66000)]\n    Factor = exp(1.506)\n    Factor ≈ 4.508\n\nThis value is approximately 4.5. The other information provided in the problem, such as the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage, is not required for this calculation since the effective temperatures are given.\n\n<<<A>>>"
