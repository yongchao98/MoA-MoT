    "### Problem Analysis\n\nThe total energy of this system is the sum of the electrostatic potential energies between all unique pairs of the 13 particles. We can divide this into two parts:\n1.  **U_center**: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  **U_sphere**: The potential energy from the interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\nThe total energy `U_total` is the sum of these two components: `U_total = U_center + U_sphere`.\n\n### Charge and Distance Values\n*   Charge of each particle (q) = 2e = 2 * (1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C) = 3.204353268 × 10⁻¹⁹ C.\n*   Distance of the 12 particles from point P (R) = 2 m.\n*   Coulomb's constant (k) ≈ 8.98755 × 10⁹ N⋅m²/C².\n\n### Calculation of U_center\n\nThe central charge interacts with each of the 12 charges on the sphere. The distance for each of these interactions is R = 2 m.\nThe potential energy for one such pair is `k * q² / R`.\nSince there are 12 such pairs, the total energy for this part is:\n`U_center = 12 * (k * q²) / R`\n\n### Calculation of U_sphere\n\nTo find the minimum energy for the 12 charges on the sphere, we must consider the Thomson problem. This problem seeks the arrangement of N identical charges on the surface of a sphere that minimizes the electrostatic potential energy. For N=12, the solution is a regular icosahedron, where the charges are located at the vertices.\n\nThe potential energy `U_sphere` is the sum of the potential energies for all pairs of the 12 charges. There are C(12, 2) = 66 such pairs.\n`U_sphere = k * q² * Σ(1/r_ij)`, where `r_ij` are the distances between the vertices of the icosahedron.\n\nThis sum can be expressed as `U_sphere = (k * q² / R) * E_12`, where `E_12` is a dimensionless constant representing the sum of inverse distances for an icosahedron inscribed in a unit sphere (R=1).\n\nThe vertices of an icosahedron have three distinct separation distances:\n*   **30 pairs** of nearest neighbors at distance `a`.\n*   **30 pairs** of next-nearest neighbors at distance `b`.\n*   **6 pairs** of antipodal vertices at distance `c = 2R`.\n\nFor an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius R=1, the distances are approximately `a ≈ 1.0515` m, `b ≈ 1.7013` m, and `c = 2` m.\nThe constant `E_12` is the sum of the inverse of these distances for all 66 pairs:\n`E_12 = 30/a + 30/b + 6/c`\n`E_12 ≈ 30/1.0515 + 30/1.7013 + 6/2`\n`E_12 ≈ 28.531 + 17.634 + 3 = 49.165`\n\n### Total Minimum Energy Calculation\n\nNow, we combine the two energy components:\n`U_total = U_center + U_sphere`\n`U_total = (12 * k * q² / R) + (k * q² / R) * E_12`\n`U_total = (k * q² / R) * (12 + E_12)`\n\nSubstituting the values:\n*   `q² = (2e)² = 4e²`\n*   `U_total = (k * 4e² / R) * (12 + 49.165)`\n*   `U_total = (4 * k * e² / R) * (61.165)`\n\nLet's calculate the value of `k * e²`:\n`k * e² ≈ (8.98755 × 10⁹) * (1.602177 × 10⁻¹⁹)² ≈ 2.30708 × 10⁻²⁸ J⋅m`\n\nNow, substitute this into the total energy equation:\n`U_total ≈ (4 * (2.30708 × 10⁻²⁸) / 2) * 61.165`\n`U_total ≈ (2 * 2.30708 × 10⁻²⁸) * 61.165`\n`U_total ≈ (4.61416 × 10⁻²⁸) * 61.165`\n`U_total ≈ 2.8219 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\nRounding to three decimal places (in scientific notation):\n`U_total ≈ 2.822 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
