    "The phenomenon of radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution, which has a key characteristic known as the \"memoryless\" property. This property means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. Therefore, the fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not influence its future decay probability.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Determine the decay constant (λ):**\n    The probability `P` that an atom will decay within a time `t` is given by the formula `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n\n    *   `0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n    *   `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    *   To solve for λ, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `-100λ = ln(0.68)`\n    *   `λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n    *   `λ ≈ -(-0.3857) / 100 ≈ 0.003857` per minute.\n\n2.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:**\n    Due to the memoryless property, the question is equivalent to finding the probability that a new atom will decay within 150 minutes. We use the same formula with `t = 150` minutes.\n\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n    *   Substitute the expression for λ we found earlier: `λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - e^((-ln(0.68) / 100) * 150)`\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))`\n    *   Using the logarithm property `a * ln(b) = ln(b^a)`, this becomes:\n        `P(150) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))`\n    *   Since `e^ln(x) = x`, the equation simplifies to:\n        `P(150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5`\n    *   `0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n    *   `P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393`\n\n3.  **Convert to percentage and compare:**\n    The calculated probability is approximately 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This value is closest to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
