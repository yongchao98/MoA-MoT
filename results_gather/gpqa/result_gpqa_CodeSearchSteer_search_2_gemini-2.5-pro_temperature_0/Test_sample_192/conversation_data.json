    "The relationship between a star's distance `d` and its parallax `plx` is inverse: `d = 1/plx`. This fundamental principle is used to calculate stellar distances; a smaller parallax angle implies a greater distance.\n\nThe problem states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars, let's call it `N`, varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This is best interpreted as the cumulative number of stars up to a certain distance `r` (which corresponds to a minimum parallax `plx`).\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Given Relationship:** The cumulative number of stars `N` is proportional to `1/plx^5`. We can write this as:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax to Distance:** The distance `r` to a star is inversely proportional to its parallax `plx`.\n    `r ∝ 1/plx`\n    This means we can express parallax in terms of distance:\n    `plx ∝ 1/r`\n\n3.  **Express Number of Stars in Terms of Distance:** Now, substitute the relationship from step 2 into the expression from step 1. This will give us the cumulative number of stars `N(r)` within a distance `r`.\n    `N(r) ∝ 1/(1/r)^5`\n    `N(r) ∝ r^5`\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:** The question asks how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance, r*. This is equivalent to finding the density of stars as a function of distance, which can be found by taking the derivative of the cumulative number of stars `N(r)` with respect to the distance `r`.\n    Let `n(r)` be the number of stars per unit distance.\n    `n(r) = dN(r)/dr`\n\n5.  **Differentiate:** Now, we differentiate the proportionality from step 3.\n    `dN(r)/dr ∝ d(r^5)/dr`\n    `dN(r)/dr ∝ 5 * r^4`\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`.\n    `n(r) ~ r^4`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ r^2\nB) ~ r^4\nC) ~ r^3\nD) ~ r^5\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
