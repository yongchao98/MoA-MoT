    "To identify the unknown compound, we must analyze the data from each characterization technique and see which of the proposed chemical formulas is the most consistent with the combined evidence.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in carboxylic acids. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch (1650-1750 cm⁻¹). Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is expected around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which typically appears in the 1680-1640 cm⁻¹ region.\n    *   The combination of a broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule. Vinyl-hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbon atoms of a double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a key piece of evidence. This fragment corresponds to the mass of a carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). This finding strongly supports the identification of the compound as a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Degree of Unsaturation\n\nThe combined spectroscopic data indicate that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid (which contains one C=O double bond) and also has a C=C double bond. Each double bond counts as one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the molecule must have a total of two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nLet's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for each of the possible formulas using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This does not match the required two degrees of unsaturation.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This matches the degrees of unsaturation, but the formula only has one oxygen atom, which contradicts the evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) that requires two oxygens.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This does not match the required two degrees of unsaturation.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has the correct degree of unsaturation (2) and contains two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe evidence from all three analytical techniques points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that accommodates a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an additional C=C double bond, as indicated by its two degrees of unsaturation and the presence of two oxygen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>"
