    "Here's a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from A2:**\n    *   A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    *   The formula for the mass fraction of fluorine is: ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F)), where 'n' is the number of fluorine atoms, M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol), and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n    *   Rearranging the formula to solve for M(Y): M(Y) = (n * M(F) * (1 - ɷF)) / ɷF.\n    *   Plugging in the values: M(Y) = (n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)) / 0.3196 ≈ 40.45 * n.\n    *   We test plausible integer values for 'n' (oxidation state):\n        *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, but CaF is not the common fluoride).\n        *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine, but also very close to Krypton, M(Kr) ≈ 83.8 g/mol). Let's check KrF₂. The fluorine percentage in KrF₂ is (2 * 19.00) / (83.8 + 2 * 19.00) = 38 / 121.8 ≈ 31.2%. This is reasonably close.\n        *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (close to Antimony).\n        *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol.\n        *   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol.\n        *   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (close to Plutonium).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Properties of A1:**\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance. While many fluorides are colorless, some, like dioxygen difluoride (O₂F₂) and chromyl fluoride (CrO₂F₂), are reddish.\n    *   A1 decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 and fluorine (F₂). This indicates A1 is unstable at room temperature and has a higher fluorine content than A2. The reaction is: A1 → A2 + F₂.\n    *   A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. This points to A1 being an exceptionally strong oxidizing agent, more so than xenon difluoride. Krypton difluoride (KrF₂) is known to oxidize xenon to xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆).\n\n3.  **Identify the Compounds:**\n    *   The fact that A1 oxidizes xenon strongly suggests that element Y might be Krypton (Kr). Krypton difluoride (KrF₂) is one of the most powerful known fluorinating agents.\n    *   If Y is Krypton, then A2 would be KrF₂. However, the mass percentage calculation (31.2%) is not a perfect match for the given 31.96%. Let's re-examine the decomposition.\n    *   The decomposition is A1 → A2 + F₂. If A2 is KrF₂, then A1 must be KrF₄.\n    *   Let's check the properties of KrF₄. It is a white crystalline solid that is thermodynamically unstable and decomposes rapidly at room temperature. This fits the description of A1's instability. The decomposition reaction would be KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂.\n    *   Now, let's re-evaluate A2. The problem states A2 has ɷF=31.96%. If A1 is KrF₄, then A2 is KrF₂. The calculated ɷF for KrF₂ is ~31.2%. The discrepancy might be due to experimental data variations in the problem statement, but Krypton fits the chemical properties described far better than any other element.\n    *   Let's assume Y is Krypton.\n        *   **A1**: KrF₄ (Krypton tetrafluoride). Although described as a white solid, its extreme reactivity and instability could align with the problem's description. It decomposes into KrF₂ and F₂.\n        *   **A2**: KrF₂ (Krypton difluoride). It is a powerful oxidizing agent. Its molar mass is approximately 121.8 g/mol.\n    *   **A3**: The problem states A3 can also interact with xenon and is obtained by fluorination of Y. This is consistent with KrF₂, which is made from Kr and F₂ and reacts with xenon. So, A3 is also KrF₂.\n    *   The problem mentions \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\" For Krypton, while KrF₂ is well-established, KrF₄ is theoretically predicted and its synthesis has been claimed but not definitively confirmed. Other compounds like KrF and KrF₆ are hypothetical or only exist under extreme conditions. The \"five compounds\" might refer to KrF₂, KrF₄, and cationic/complex species like KrF⁺, Kr₂F₃⁺, and [KrF⁺][SbF₆⁻]. This part of the prompt is slightly ambiguous but doesn't prevent solving the core problem.\n\n4.  **Identify A4 and A5:**\n    *   A5 is obtained by adding Y (Krypton) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4.\n    *   A5 decomposes in water into two substances.\n    *   This points towards a clathrate compound. Clathrates are substances where one type of molecule is trapped within the crystal lattice of another. Krypton is known to form clathrates with water and other molecules like hydroquinone and phenol.\n    *   Let's assume A4 is a substance that can form a clathrate with Krypton. Hydroquinone (C₆H₄(OH)₂) is a classic example.\n    *   **A4**: Hydroquinone (C₆H₄(OH)₂). It is a colorless solid and forms solutions.\n    *   **A5**: Krypton-hydroquinone clathrate. The general formula is [C₆H₄(OH)₂]₃·Kr. This is formed by adding Krypton to a solution of hydroquinone.\n    *   When this clathrate (A5) is placed in water, it decomposes back into its constituent parts: Krypton gas and a solution of hydroquinone. These are the \"two substances.\"\n\n5.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    *   A4 has been identified as hydroquinone.\n    *   The chemical formula for hydroquinone is C₆H₄(OH)₂.\n    *   Molar Mass Calculation:\n        *   Carbon (C): 6 * 12.01 g/mol = 72.06 g/mol\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 6 * 1.01 g/mol = 6.06 g/mol\n        *   Oxygen (O): 2 * 16.00 g/mol = 32.00 g/mol\n        *   Total Molar Mass = 72.06 + 6.06 + 32.00 = **110.12 g/mol**.\n\n6.  **Select the Correct Range:**\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of A4 (110.12 g/mol) falls within the range of 110-130.\n\n<<<D>>>"
