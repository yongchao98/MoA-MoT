    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula for calculating the degree of unsaturation is `(2C + 2 + N - H - X) / 2`.\n    *   (2 * 9 + 2 + 1 - 11 - 0) / 2 = (18 + 2 + 1 - 11) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5.\n*   A degree of unsaturation of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. The frequency is consistent with a conjugated ester.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons suggests a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom (-O-CH2-). This pattern, combined with the triplet at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is a classic signal for the two protons of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to proton exchange and quadrupolar relaxation from the nitrogen atom.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggests a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two equivalent sets. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester), while the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis of the spectral data, the fragments are:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3)\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nPutting these pieces together, the only structure that fits all the data is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### **5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not an ester, and its NMR spectrum would be different.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester. The ethyl group would be attached to the carbonyl, showing a quartet around 2.3-2.6 ppm, which contradicts the observed quartet at 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the data: the molecular formula, the IR bands for a primary amine and a conjugated ester, and the ¹H NMR signals for an ethyl ester, a primary aromatic amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide and is 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would result in a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two clean doublets.\n\nTherefore, the compound is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
