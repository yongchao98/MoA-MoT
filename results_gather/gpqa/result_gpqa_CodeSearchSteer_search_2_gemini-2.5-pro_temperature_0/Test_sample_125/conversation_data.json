    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the ketone creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the starting material is enantiomerically pure (only the S-isomer), the hydride can attack the carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to the formation of two products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBHâ‚„) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. This results in the formation of three stereoisomers:\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Since the starting material is achiral, these are formed as a racemic mixture.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n### **Combined Products**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the mixture contains a total of five different compounds:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **HPLC Analysis**\n\nThe combined product mixture is analyzed using two different HPLC methods.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, are physically identical in an achiral environment and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different properties, thus eluting as a **separate, second peak** from the Reaction II products.\n*   The products of Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (diols) and will not overlap.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase chromatogram is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral stationary phase is designed to interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It will also separate diastereomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will be resolved by the chiral column into **two separate peaks**.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is achiral and does not have an enantiomer, so it will appear as a **single peak**.\n*   The total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>"
