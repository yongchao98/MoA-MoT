    "The search results confirm the physical principles I used.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature**: The planetary equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is the theoretical temperature a planet would have if it were a black body heated only by its star. The formula involves the star's properties (Luminosity or Temperature and Radius) and the planet's semi-major axis ('a') and albedo ('A'). The key relationship derived from the energy balance is that the absorbed power is proportional to 1/a² and the emitted power is proportional to T_eq⁴. This leads to T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/a², which simplifies to T_eq ∝ 1/√a. My initial relationship was correct. The fact that the albedo is the same for all planets simplifies the proportionality.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law**: The law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of its orbit (P² ∝ a³). This can be written as (P₁/P₂)² = (a₁/a₂)³. This applies to any system of planets orbiting the same central star, where the planets' masses are negligible compared to the star's mass. The problem's mention of the TTV method implies the planets have non-zero mass, but without the star's mass, the simplified law is the only one that can be used.\n\nThe calculation steps remain the same and are validated by these principles.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes.**\nThe relationship between equilibrium temperature and semi-major axis is:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes of two planets (i and j) orbiting the same star is:\na_j / a_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)²\n\nGiven:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4\n*   T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3\n\nWe can find the ratios of the semi-major axes:\n*   a₂ / a₁ = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)² = 1.4² = 1.96\n*   a₃ / a₂ = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)² = 2.3² = 5.29\n\nTo find the ratio a₃ / a₁, we multiply the individual ratios:\n*   a₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods.**\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the relationship between the orbital period (P) and the semi-major axis (a) is:\nP² ∝ a³\nTherefore, the ratio of the orbital periods is:\nP₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2)\n\nUsing the value of a₃ / a₁ calculated in the first step:\n*   P₃ / P₁ = (10.3684)^(3/2)\n*   P₃ / P₁ ≈ 33.385\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4. The information regarding the masses and the TTV discovery method is extraneous to the calculation, as is the specific albedo value (as long as it's constant for all three planets).\n\nComparing the result with the given options:\nA) ~ 33.4\nB) ~ 4.4\nC) ~ 3.2\nD) ~ 10.4\n\nThe calculated factor matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
