    "The reasoning behind the derivation is sound and confirmed by the search results. The relationship between the population of atomic energy levels and temperature in a stellar photosphere (assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, LTE) is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is given as:\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N_j and N_i are the number of atoms in the higher energy state (j) and lower energy state (i), respectively.\n*   g_j and g_i are the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n*   E_j - E_i is the energy difference between the levels (ΔE).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature.\n\nLet's define the ratio of populations (N_j / N_i) as R.\n\nFor star 1, with temperature T_1:\nR_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\nFor star 2, with temperature T_2:\nR_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2, which means R_1 = 2 * R_2.\n\n(g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights (g_j / g_i) cancels out as it's an atomic property and is the same for both stars.\n\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for ln(2):\n\nln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\nFactoring out the common term ΔE / k:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\nCombining the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant, k, is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE / k is approximately 1.\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation:\n\nln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
