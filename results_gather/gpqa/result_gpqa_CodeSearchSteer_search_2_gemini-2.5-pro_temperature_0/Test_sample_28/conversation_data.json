    "To identify the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the one that would most severely disrupt the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis. This is typically achieved by a mutation that leads to a non-functional or truncated protein.\n\n### Analysis of the Mutations\n\nFirst, let's establish the reading frame from the intact gene sequence. The sequence begins with `ATG`, the start codon, so the codons are read in groups of three from the beginning.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`…-3’\n    *   This translates to: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`…-3’\n    *   Compared to the intact gene, the `TTT` codon is now `TTC`, and `CTC` is now `TAC`.\n    *   `TTT` to `TTC` both code for Phenylalanine (a silent mutation).\n    *   `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this could potentially affect the protein's function, it might also have little to no effect, especially if the amino acids have similar properties or are not in a critical region of the protein. The protein is still produced at full length.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`…-3’\n    *   Here, the `CTC` codon for Leucine has been changed to `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   This mutation causes translation to stop prematurely, resulting in a severely shortened protein (only two amino acids long in this case). A truncated protein of this nature is almost certain to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`…-3’\n    *   Comparing the codons to the intact gene:\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   `ACT` (Threonine) changes to `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   This mutant contains at least two **missense mutations**. Similar to Mutant 1, this changes amino acids but still produces a full-length protein. The functional impact is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT`…-3’\n    *   Comparing the codons to the intact gene:\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   `GGT` (Glycine) changes to `GCT` (Alanine).\n    *   This mutant also contains two **missense mutations**. Like mutants 1 and 3, it produces a full-length protein with a few amino acid changes, making the loss of function less certain than a nonsense mutation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAmong the given options, a nonsense mutation is the most likely to cause a complete loss of function. Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. This will halt protein synthesis and produce a tiny, non-functional peptide, thereby eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. While frameshift mutations are also highly effective at knocking out genes, Mutant 2 clearly and unambiguously represents a nonsense mutation, the most severe type among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>"
