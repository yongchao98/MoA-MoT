    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct option:\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a type of isomerism where a molecule exists in two or more readily interconvertible structures that differ in the relative position of at least one atom, commonly a hydrogen atom. Keto-enol tautomerism is a common type that occurs in carbonyl compounds, but it requires the presence of at least one alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):** In the structure of benzoquinone, the carbon atoms adjacent to the two carbonyl groups are part of carbon-carbon double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has alpha-hydrogens on the carbons situated between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6). The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows it to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic compound, which makes it particularly stable. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does exhibit tautomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon has four different substituents, it is a chiral center. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* configuration across the double bond. The molecule is symmetrical and possesses a plane of symmetry. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and thus do not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining the conclusions from both parts:\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
