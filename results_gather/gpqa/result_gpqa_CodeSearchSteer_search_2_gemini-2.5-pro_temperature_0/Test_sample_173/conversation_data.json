    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest Masses and Energy Released\n\nFirst, we establish the rest masses of the initial nucleus (M) and the two fragments (m1 and m2).\n\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** The problem states the initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Relationship:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   **Sum of Fragment Masses:** The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nWe can solve for the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation: `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, which simplifies to `3*m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n2.  This gives `m2 = 0.33 * M`. Consequently, `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n3.  Now, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m1c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m2c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total rest-mass energy of the fragments.\n*   **Q-value:** `Q = Mc² - (m1c² + m2c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThis Q-value is the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T1\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is given by `T = p² / (2m)`. Due to the conservation of momentum, the initial momentum is zero, so the final momenta of the fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (`p1 = p2 = p`).\n\n*   From `p² = 2*m1*T1` and `p² = 2*m2*T2`, we get `m1*T1 = m2*T2`.\n*   This gives the ratio of kinetic energies: `T1 / T2 = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `T1 / T2 = 1/2`, which means `T2 = 2 * T1`.\n*   Substituting this into the total kinetic energy equation: `T1 + 2*T1 = Q`, so `3*T1 = Q`.\n*   **Classical T1:** `T1_classical = Q / 3 = 3 GeV / 3 = 1 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Relativistic Calculation of T1\n\nFor the correct relativistic calculation, we use the energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The total energy `E` is the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `mc²`.\n\n*   Rearranging the energy-momentum relation gives `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`), their squares are also equal: `(p1c)² = (p2c)²`.\n*   Therefore: `T1² + 2*T1*m1c² = T2² + 2*T2*m2c²`.\n*   We know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`. Substituting this into the equation:\n    `T1² + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)² + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n*   Expanding and simplifying the equation:\n    `T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    `T1² + 396*T1 = T1² - 204*T1 + 603`\n    `396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n*   **Relativistic T1:** `T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Difference\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1.\n\n*   **Difference:** `ΔT1 = T1_relativistic - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   To convert this to MeV, we multiply by 1000 (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    `ΔT1 = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 value and the value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
