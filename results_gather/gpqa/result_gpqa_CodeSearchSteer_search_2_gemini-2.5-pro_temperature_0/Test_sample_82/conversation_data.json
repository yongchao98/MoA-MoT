    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   **Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Volume of water added:** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final volume of the solution (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, we find the new concentration (M₂):\n    (0.05 M) × (20.00 cm³) = M₂ × (40.00 cm³)\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, the titration begins with 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), by the NaOH. This creates a buffer solution. The pH of a buffer can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   **Ka of acetic acid:** 1.85 x 10⁻⁵ (as given in the problem)\n*   **pKa:** -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   **Ratio of [A⁻] to [HA]:** At 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base to the remaining acid is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   **pH Calculation:**\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - log(3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.256\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO). The solution now contains the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), which is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Step 1: Find the moles of acetic acid.**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 moles\n\n*   **Step 2: Find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.**\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity of NaOH = 0.001 moles / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.0 cm³\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the total volume and concentration of acetate at the equivalence point.**\n    Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.0 cm³ = 50.0 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    Concentration of acetate [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the pH of the acetate solution.**\n    The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka (where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C)\n    Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    Now, we find the hydroxide concentration [OH⁻] using the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02, we can simplify:\n    x² ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02\n    x² ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n    Now, calculate pOH:\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    Finally, calculate pH:\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated pH values are **4.26** at 25% titration and **8.52** at the equivalence point. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
