    "To determine the angle between the directions of the two photons, we must apply the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. The process involves an electron and a positron annihilating each other to produce two photons.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial total energy:**\n    The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n    *   Energy of the electron (E_e) = γ_e * m_e * c² = 4 * m_e * c²\n    *   Energy of the positron (E_p) = γ_p * m_p * c² = 2 * m_e * c² (since the positron has the same rest mass as the electron).\n    *   Total initial energy (E_initial) = E_e + E_p = (4 + 2) * m_e * c² = 6 * m_e * c².\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial total momentum:**\n    The relativistic momentum can be calculated using the formula p = √(E² - (mc²)²)/c or p = mc√(γ² - 1).\n    *   Momentum of the electron (p_e), moving from the left (+x direction):\n        p_e = m_e * c * √(4² - 1) = m_e * c * √15.\n    *   Momentum of the positron (p_p), moving from the right (-x direction):\n        p_p = -m_e * c * √(2² - 1) = -m_e * c * √3.\n    *   Total initial momentum (p_initial) is the vector sum. Since the motion is along the horizontal axis, we only have an x-component:\n        p_initial = p_e + p_p = m_e * c * (√15 - √3).\n\n3.  **Apply conservation laws to the final state (photons):**\n    The initial energy and momentum must be conserved in the final state. The final state consists of two photons.\n    *   **Energy Conservation:** The total initial energy is transferred to the two photons. Since the problem states they have the same energy (E_γ), we have:\n        E_initial = E_γ + E_γ = 2 * E_γ\n        6 * m_e * c² = 2 * E_γ\n        E_γ = 3 * m_e * c²\n    *   **Momentum Conservation:** For a photon, the momentum (p_γ) is related to its energy by p_γ = E_γ / c.\n        p_γ = (3 * m_e * c²) / c = 3 * m_e * c.\n        The total initial momentum must equal the total final momentum of the two photons. Since the initial momentum is purely in the horizontal (x) direction, the vertical (y) components of the photons' momenta must cancel out. This is consistent with one photon moving upper-right and the other lower-right with equal energies, implying their angles with the horizontal axis are equal and opposite (let's call them θ and -θ).\n        The total final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of each photon's momentum:\n        p_final = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ).\n\n4.  **Solve for the angle:**\n    By equating the initial and final momentum in the x-direction:\n    p_initial = p_final\n    m_e * c * (√15 - √3) = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ)\n    (√15 - √3) = 6 * cos(θ)\n    cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n\n    Now, we calculate the value:\n    cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n    θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\n    The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is 2θ.\n    Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<D>>>"
