    "### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The single ¹H NMR peak indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The 7 ppm shift is characteristic of vinylic (alkene) protons.\n        *   The two ¹³C NMR peaks suggest a molecule with two types of carbon atoms. The 165 ppm peak is typical for a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride, and the 137 ppm peak is in the range for an alkene carbon.\n        *   Maleic acid is a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. Its dehydration product, maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃), fits this data perfectly. It has two equivalent vinylic protons and two sets of equivalent carbons (two C=O and two C=C), which explains the observed spectra.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This molecule has a five-membered ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, and a CH₂ group at position 5. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride). This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. Typically, the *endo* product is the kinetically favored major product, while the *exo* product is the thermodynamically more stable minor product. The problem states a major and a minor product are formed, consistent with the formation of both isomers.\n\n3.  **Structure of the Adducts and Proton Assignments:**\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene core structure.\n    *   **Protons and Signals:**\n        *   **Me_bridgehead:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). These are on saturated carbons and will appear as a 6H singlet at a lower chemical shift, estimated around **~1.0 ppm**.\n        *   **Me_alkene:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C2, C3). These vinylic methyls will appear as a 6H singlet at a higher chemical shift, estimated around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **H_A:** Two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (C5, C6). These protons are alpha to carbonyl groups and will be a 2H singlet, shifted downfield to around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **C7 Protons:** The CH₂ bridge has two diastereotopic protons (*syn* and *anti* to the double bond). They will appear as two separate 1H signals, likely doublets due to geminal coupling. Their shift is estimated to be around **~1.5 ppm**.\n\n4.  **NOESY Analysis to Distinguish Isomers:**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). The key to distinguishing the *endo* and *exo* isomers is identifying which protons are brought close together in each configuration.\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C7 bridge. In this orientation, the anhydride protons (H_A) are far from the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene).\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"away\" from the C7 bridge and is on the same side as the double bond. In this orientation, the anhydride protons (H_A) are very close to the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene).\n    *   **The Differentiating Cross-Peak:** The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor product.\n        *   The NOE interaction between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene) is strong and characteristic for the *exo* (minor) isomer.\n        *   Therefore, the absence of this peak is characteristic of the *endo* (major) isomer.\n        *   The question asks for a cross-peak that *is present* in the major product. Let's re-examine the options based on our signal assignments.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **Signal Assignments:**\n        *   6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm → Me_alkene\n        *   2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm → H_A (anhydride protons)\n        *   6H singlet at ~1 ppm → Me_bridgehead\n        *   1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm → C7 bridge proton\n    *   **Option A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene):** The distance between these two sets of methyl groups is significant in both isomers. A strong, differentiating NOE is not expected.\n    *   **Option B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_A):** This corresponds to the interaction between the alkene methyl groups and the anhydride protons. As established, this interaction is characteristic of the *exo* (minor) product. Since the question asks for a cross-peak in the *major* product's spectrum which is absent in the minor, this is the inverse of what is described. However, it is the most significant stereochemical differentiating peak. There might be a misunderstanding in the problem's premise or the common kinetic/thermodynamic product distribution for this specific highly substituted system. Let's reconsider. The *endo* product is the kinetic product due to secondary orbital overlap. The *exo* is the thermodynamic product because it's less sterically hindered. The reaction is likely run under kinetic control, making the *endo* product major. But what if the steric hindrance from the four methyl groups on the diene is so significant that it reverses the usual selectivity, making the *exo* product the major one? If the *exo* product were the major product, then the cross-peak between Me_alkene (~1.7 ppm) and H_A (~3.5 ppm) would be the correct answer. Given the options, this is the most plausible chemical scenario that leads to one of the answers.\n    *   **Option C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_A):** An interaction between H_A and a C7 proton exists in both isomers (with H_anti in *endo* and H_syn in *exo*). It is unlikely to be strongly present in one and completely absent in the other.\n    *   **Option D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 proton):** The distance between the bridgehead methyls and the C7 protons should be similar in both isomers.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The most significant and differentiating NOE interaction is between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene). This interaction is strong in the *exo* isomer and very weak or absent in the *endo* isomer. The question describes a peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor. If we assume the major product is the *exo* isomer (which is plausible due to the steric bulk of the four methyl groups on the diene overriding the usual *endo* preference), then the cross-peak would be between the 6H singlet of the alkene methyls (~1.7 ppm) and the 2H singlet of the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm). This matches option B.\n\nFinal check: The interaction described in B is the most chemically sound for differentiating the two stereoisomers via NOESY. The ambiguity lies in which isomer is major. In many simple cases, *endo* is major. However, with heavily substituted dienes, this can be reversed. Assuming the question and options lead to a correct chemical conclusion, the most logical answer is that the major product is *exo*, and the observed cross-peak is between the spatially proximate alkene methyls and anhydride protons.\n\n<<<B>>>"
