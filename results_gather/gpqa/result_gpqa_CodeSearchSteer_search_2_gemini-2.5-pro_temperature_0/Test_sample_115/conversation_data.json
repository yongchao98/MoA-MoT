    "Here is a step-by-step identification of compound D:\n\n1.  **Identification of Compound A**: The proton NMR spectrum shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) and a quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H). This pattern is characteristic of two equivalent ethyl groups (CH₃-CH₂-). The chemical shifts are in the alkane region. The only simple alkane that fits this description is n-butane (CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₃), where the two methyl groups are equivalent and the two methylene groups are equivalent. Thus, Compound A is n-butane.\n\n2.  **Identification of Compound B**: Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. This is a radical halogenation reaction. Bromination can occur at a primary carbon (C1) to give 1-bromobutane or at a secondary carbon (C2) to give 2-bromobutane. The secondary radical is more stable, so 2-bromobutane is the major product. Therefore, Compound B is 2-bromobutane.\n\n3.  **Identification of Compound C**: Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a strong base, which promotes an E2 elimination reaction (dehydrohalogenation). According to Zaitsev's rule, the more substituted (and more stable) alkene is the major product. Elimination of HBr from 2-bromobutane can form but-1-ene (minor product) or but-2-ene (major product). The problem states that compound C has two geometrical isomers, which is true for but-2-ene (*cis* and *trans* isomers). Thus, Compound C is but-2-ene.\n\n4.  **Identification of Compound D**: The *cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-but-2-ene) acts as the dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction with the diene, (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n    *   **Diene**: (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol (HO-CH=CH-CH=CH-CH₃)\n    *   **Dienophile**: *cis*-but-2-ene (CH₃-CH=CH-CH₃)\n\n    This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a six-membered ring, specifically a substituted cyclohexene. The product will be a 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol. The stereochemistry of the product is determined by the stereochemistry of the reactants.\n\n    *   **From the dienophile**: The two methyl groups in *cis*-but-2-ene are *cis* to each other. In the product, they will remain *cis* on the newly formed ring (at positions C5 and C6).\n    *   **From the diene**: The diene has an (E,E) configuration. The substituents at C1 (-OH) and C4 (-CH₃) are on opposite sides in the s-cis conformation, which means they will be *trans* to each other in the final product.\n    *   **Overall Stereochemistry (Endo/Exo Selectivity)**: The Diels-Alder reaction generally favors the *endo* product due to secondary orbital overlap. For this specific reaction, this selectivity dictates the relative orientation between the dienophile's substituents and the diene's substituents. The favored transition state leads to a specific diastereomer.\n\n    Based on these rules, the resulting stereochemistry of the product is (1S,4R,5S,6S). Let's verify this:\n    *   **C1**: The hydroxyl group.\n    *   **C4**: The methyl group from the diene.\n    *   **C5 & C6**: The methyl groups from the dienophile.\n\n    The relative stereochemistry is as follows:\n    *   The OH at C1 is *trans* to the CH₃ at C4.\n    *   The CH₃ at C5 is *cis* to the CH₃ at C6.\n    *   The favored diastereomer has the configuration (1S, 4R, 5S, 6S).\n\nTherefore, compound D is (1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n\n<<<B>>>"
