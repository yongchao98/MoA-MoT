    "To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to perform a series of calculations involving its lifetime and relativistic properties.\n\n**1. Calculate the lifetime (τ):**\nThe lifetime of a particle is inversely proportional to its decay width (Γ). The relationship is given by the formula τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nGiven:\n*   Decay width, Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.320 GeV\n*   Reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻²⁵ GeV·s\n\nCalculation:\nτ = (6.582 x 10⁻²⁵ GeV·s) / (0.320 GeV)\nτ ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n**2. Calculate the relativistic factors (γ and β):**\nThe Lorentz factor (γ) is the ratio of the particle's energy (E) to its rest mass (m).\n\nGiven:\n*   Energy, E_X = 8 GeV\n*   Mass, m_X = 1.2 GeV\n\nCalculation of γ:\nγ = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.67\n\nThe factor β is the ratio of the particle's velocity to the speed of light (c) and can be calculated from γ using the formula β = √(1 - 1/γ²).\n\nCalculation of β:\nβ = √(1 - 1/(6.67)²) = √(1 - 1/44.49) = √(1 - 0.0225) = √0.9775 ≈ 0.9887\n\n**3. Calculate the mean decay distance (d):**\nThe mean decay distance in the laboratory frame is the distance the particle travels on average before decaying. Due to time dilation at relativistic speeds, the lifetime in the lab frame is γτ. The distance is this dilated lifetime multiplied by the particle's velocity (v = βc). The formula is d = γ * β * c * τ.\n\nGiven:\n*   Speed of light, c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n\nCalculation:\nd = (6.67) * (0.9887) * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\nd ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nAlternatively, a more direct formula for the mean decay length is l = (p/m) * cτ, where p is the momentum.\nFirst, calculate the momentum p = √(E² - m²) = √(8² - 1.2²) = √(64 - 1.44) = √62.56 ≈ 7.91 GeV/c.\nThen, calculate cτ = ħc / Γ. Using ħc ≈ 0.1973 GeV·fm (where 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m):\ncτ = (0.1973 GeV·fm) / (0.320 GeV) ≈ 0.6166 fm.\nFinally, calculate the decay length:\nd = (7.91 GeV/c / 1.2 GeV/c²) * (0.6166 x 10⁻¹⁵ m) = (6.59) * (0.6166 x 10⁻¹⁵ m) ≈ 4.065 x 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\nBoth calculation methods yield a result that corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
