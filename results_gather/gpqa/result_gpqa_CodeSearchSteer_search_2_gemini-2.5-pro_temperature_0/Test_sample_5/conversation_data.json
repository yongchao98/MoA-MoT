    "To find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we first need to express the given potential in Cartesian coordinates. The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\n\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nThe transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is given by x = r cos(θ) and y = r sin(θ). From these, we have r² = x² + y² and x² = r² cos²(θ).\n\nSubstituting these into the potential energy expression, we get:\n\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 kx²\n\nCombining the terms, we have:\n\nV(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k)x² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\nThis potential can be separated into two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials, one for the x-direction and one for the y-direction:\n\nV(x, y) = V(x) + V(y)\nwhere V(x) = 1/2 (4k)x² and V(y) = 1/2 ky²\n\nThe energy of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator is given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where ω = sqrt(k'/m) and k' is the effective spring constant.\n\nFor the motion in the x-direction, the effective spring constant is k_x = 4k. The corresponding angular frequency is:\n\nω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe energy levels for the x-motion are:\n\nE_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\nFor the motion in the y-direction, the spring constant is k_y = k. The corresponding angular frequency is:\n\nω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe energy levels for the y-motion are:\n\nE_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nSince the motions are independent, the total energy of the system is the sum of the energies for the x and y motions.\n\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = 2(n_x + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
