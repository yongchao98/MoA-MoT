    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the number of moles of acid and base being mixed.\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of each substance:**\n    *   **CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 moles\n    *   **HCl (strong acid):**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 moles\n        Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n    *   **Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 moles\n        Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, it dissociates to produce two OH⁻ ions per formula unit.\n        Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 moles = 0.180 moles.\n\n2.  **Perform the neutralization reactions:**\n    The strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will react completely with the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂) first.\n    *   Reaction: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles H⁺ (strong) = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    *   The H⁺ is the limiting reactant. All 0.080 moles of H⁺ will be neutralized.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 moles.\n\n    Next, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   Reaction: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n    *   The CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant. All 0.050 moles of the weak acid will be neutralized.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 moles.\n\n3.  **Calculate the final pH:**\n    The final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess strong base (OH⁻). The pH will be determined by the concentration of this excess strong base, as its contribution to the hydroxide concentration is much greater than that of the weak conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) formed.\n    *   **Total volume of the solution:**\n        Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n    *   **Concentration of excess OH⁻:**\n        [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n        [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n    *   **Calculate pOH:**\n        pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n        pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   **Calculate pH:**\n        pH + pOH = 14\n        pH = 14 - pOH\n        pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
