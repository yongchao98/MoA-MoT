    "### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone (butan-2-one). The process involves the nucleophilic addition of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. This initially forms an alkoxide intermediate. To obtain the final product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group, this intermediate must be protonated. Reagent A must therefore be a proton source. Typically, this reaction is carried out by using a cyanide salt like NaCN with an acid. The hydronium ion (H₃O⁺), generated from a strong acid in water, serves as an excellent proton source for this step.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating. Given the options, reagent B acts as the catalyst in the presence of water. Strong acids like hydrochloric acid (HCl) are commonly used to effectively hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids. The reaction proceeds by protonating the nitrile, making it more susceptible to attack by water, eventually leading to the carboxylic acid.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   For the first reaction, the protonation of the alkoxide intermediate is best achieved with a strong acid source, making **A = H₃O⁺**.\n*   For the second reaction, the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid is efficiently catalyzed by a strong acid, making **B = HCl**.\n\nTherefore, the correct set of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<D>>>"
