    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotope of each element.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** A significant peak is observed at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ and M+2 pattern, with a ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32), is a distinctive indicator of the presence of a single chlorine atom. This is due to the natural isotopic abundance of chlorine: ³⁵Cl (≈75%) and ³⁷Cl (≈25%). The M+ peak corresponds to the molecule containing ³⁵Cl, and the M+2 peak corresponds to the molecule containing ³⁷Cl.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom. The molecular formula for all the options is C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol, consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is a result of hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests it belongs to a carboxylic acid. Aromatic carboxylic acids typically show a C=O stretch in the 1710-1680 cm⁻¹ range.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates option D (Phenyl chloroformate), which is an ester and would not show the broad O-H stretch, and option B (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde), which is an aldehyde and a phenol.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically 10-13 ppm) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its chemical shift is high due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent carbonyl group and hydrogen bonding. It appears as a singlet (s) because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton (1H).\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The presence of signals between 7.0 and 8.5 ppm indicates an aromatic ring.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a doublet, meaning the protons are coupled to one neighboring proton. It integrates to two protons, indicating two chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This is also a doublet integrating to two protons.\n*   **Aromatic Substitution Pattern:** The pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic sign of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-substituted ring makes the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry equivalent to the two on the other side. The protons at 8.02 ppm are likely *ortho* to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, which deshields them significantly. The protons at 7.72 ppm are *ortho* to the chlorine atom.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Final Candidates\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This would have a 1,2-disubstitution pattern. Due to the lack of symmetry, it would show four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, not two doublets.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This has a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern. This structure is perfectly consistent with all the data:\n    *   **MS:** Molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ (MW ≈ 156.57 g/mol) with one chlorine atom.\n    *   **IR:** Contains a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Shows a carboxylic acid proton and the characteristic two-doublet pattern for a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe spectral data collectively and unequivocally identify the unknown compound as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
