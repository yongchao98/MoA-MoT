    "To determine the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator, we can use the principle of conservation of energy. The total energy of the system, which is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the potential energy of the spring, must remain constant throughout the oscillation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Total Energy at Maximum Amplitude (x = A):**\n    At the point of maximum displacement, or amplitude (A), the mass is momentarily at rest.\n    *   The speed `v` is 0.\n    *   The kinetic energy is 0.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: `U = (1/2)kA²`.\n    *   The relativistic energy of the mass is purely its rest energy, `E_rest = mc²`.\n    *   Therefore, the total energy of the system is `E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA²`.\n\n2.  **Total Energy at the Equilibrium Position (x = 0):**\n    At the equilibrium position, the mass is moving at its maximum speed, `v_max`.\n    *   The potential energy `U` is 0.\n    *   The speed is `v_max`.\n    *   The total relativistic energy of the mass is given by `E = γmc²`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)`.\n    *   Therefore, the total energy of the system at this point is `E_total = γmc²`.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    By equating the total energy at the two points, we get:\n    `mc² + (1/2)kA² = γmc²`\n\n4.  **Solving for v_max:**\n    First, substitute the expression for `γ`:\n    `mc² + (1/2)kA² = (1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)) * mc²`\n\n    Divide both sides by `mc²`:\n    `1 + (kA²)/(2mc²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)`\n\n    Now, rearrange the equation to solve for `v_max`:\n    `sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))`\n\n    Square both sides:\n    `1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²`\n\n    Isolate the `v_max²/c²` term:\n    `v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²`\n\n    Finally, multiply by `c²` and take the square root:\n    `v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²)`\n\nThis result matches option A. The derivation relies on the fundamental principles of energy conservation applied to a relativistic system.\n\n<<<A>>>"
