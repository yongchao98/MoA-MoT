    "The user wants me to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of a molecule synthesized through a four-step process.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of the reaction:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid + Bromine + Pyridine + Acetic Anhydride → Product 1**\n    This is an alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, specifically the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is brominated at the alpha-carbon.\n    *   Product 1 is **bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 + Ethanol + H₂SO₄ → Product 2**\n    This is a Fischer esterification. Bromoacetic acid is reacted with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   Product 2 is **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 + Sodium Cyanide → Product 3**\n    This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   Product 3 is **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 + excess Sodium Hydride + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4**\n    This is a multi-step process in one pot.\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the two adjacent electron-withdrawing groups (cyano and ester).\n        *   NCCH₂COOEt + NaH → [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   The resulting carbanion (an enolate) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br) in an SN2 reaction.\n        *   [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + Br(CH₂)₅Br → NCCH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + Br⁻\n    *   The problem states *excess* sodium hydride is used. The mono-alkylated product still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. The excess NaH will deprotonate this carbon again.\n        *   NCCH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + NaH → [NCC(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   The resulting carbanion is now part of the same molecule as an alkyl bromide. It will undergo an intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the carbon bearing the bromine. This forms a cyclic compound. The ring will consist of the α-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a 6-membered ring.\n    *   Product 4 is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane):**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. The time-averaged conformation has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, the two substituents, and the opposite carbon, C4.\n*   **Chemical Equivalence:** Protons that can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like this plane of reflection) are chemically equivalent and will have the same chemical shift. Protons that cannot be interchanged are chemically distinct.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH₂-:** The two protons of the methylene group are enantiotopic because they are related by the plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry relates the protons on C2 with C6, and C3 with C5.\n    *   **C2 and C6:** These two carbons are equivalent. On each carbon, there is an axial and an equatorial proton. These two protons (e.g., H2-ax and H2-eq) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. Because C2 and C6 are equivalent, the two axial protons (H2-ax, H6-ax) form one set, and the two equatorial protons (H2-eq, H6-eq) form another. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C3 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent. Similar to the C2/C6 case, the axial protons (H3-ax, H5-ax) are equivalent to each other, and the equatorial protons (H3-eq, H5-eq) are equivalent to each other. The axial and equatorial protons on the same carbon are distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons attached to it (H4-ax and H4-eq) are diastereotopic and not interchangeable. They are in different chemical environments. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH₃) + 1 (OCH₂) = 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n*   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\nThe analysis of the reaction sequence leads to 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. The symmetry analysis of this molecule reveals 8 chemically distinct sets of protons.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n- Reaction sequence is standard and correct.\n- Final product structure is correct.\n- Symmetry analysis of a 1,1-disubstituted cyclohexane is standard. The presence of a symmetry plane simplifies the spectrum but does not make all ring protons equivalent. Axial and equatorial protons on the same carbon are diastereotopic (unless other symmetries are present), and thus distinct. Protons on carbons related by the symmetry plane are equivalent.\n- C2-Hax is equivalent to C6-Hax.\n- C2-Heq is equivalent to C6-Heq.\n- C3-Hax is equivalent to C5-Hax.\n- C3-Heq is equivalent to C5-Heq.\n- C4-Hax is distinct from C4-Heq.\n- OCH₂ protons are enantiotopic and thus equivalent in an achiral solvent.\n- CH₃ protons are equivalent.\n- Total count: 1(CH₃) + 1(OCH₂) + 1(C2/6ax) + 1(C2/6eq) + 1(C3/5ax) + 1(C3/5eq) + 1(C4ax) + 1(C4eq) = 8 signals.\n\nThe reasoning is sound.\n\nThe final product, 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane, has the following distinct proton environments:\n\n1.  The three protons of the methyl group in the ethyl ester.\n2.  The two protons of the methylene group in the ethyl ester (these are enantiotopic and thus chemically equivalent).\n3.  The two axial protons on carbons 2 and 6 of the cyclohexane ring.\n4.  The two equatorial protons on carbons 2 and 6 of the cyclohexane ring.\n5.  The two axial protons on carbons 3 and 5 of the cyclohexane ring.\n6.  The two equatorial protons on carbons 3 and 5 of the cyclohexane ring.\n7.  The axial proton on carbon 4 of the cyclohexane ring.\n8.  The equatorial proton on carbon 4 of the cyclohexane ring.\n\nThis gives a total of 8 distinct signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
