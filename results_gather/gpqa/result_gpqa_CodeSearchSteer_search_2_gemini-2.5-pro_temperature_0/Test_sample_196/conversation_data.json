    "### Analysis of Compound X\n\nFirst, the structure of the starting material, Compound X, is determined from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\nBased on the IR data, Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet in the downfield region is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, suggest a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield shift of the doublet at 8.0 ppm indicates it is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n*   **Alkyl Group Analysis:**\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet representing a methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for a methylene group (-CH₂-) coupled to the methyl group (at 0.9 ppm) and a methine group (-CH-).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for a methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a single proton (the methine group).\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for a methine proton (-CH-) that is attached to the benzene ring (benzylic position), the methyl group (at 1.4 ppm), and the methylene group (at 1.7 ppm).\n*   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** The fragments -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃) form a *sec*-butyl group.\n\n**Conclusion for Compound X:**\nCombining all the spectral information, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (D).\n\n### Reaction and Final Product Identification\n\nCompound X, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is reacted with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids to their corresponding alkanes.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **Transformation:** The -COOH group is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Final Product:** The benzene ring and the *sec*-butyl group remain unchanged. The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\nThis corresponds to option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
