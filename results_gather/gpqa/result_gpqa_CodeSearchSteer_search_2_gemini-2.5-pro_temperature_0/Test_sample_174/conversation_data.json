    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a simple geometry like a spheroid oscillating along its symmetry axis (the z-axis), can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The properties of the radiation emitted by such a dipole can be used to answer the question.\n\n### Angular Distribution of Radiated Power\n\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the radiated power per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) is not uniform in all directions. It is dependent on the angle θ with respect to the axis of oscillation. The relationship is given by:\n\n*   *dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)*\n\nThis means the power is zero along the axis of the dipole (θ = 0° and θ = 180°) and is at its maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis (θ = 90°).\n\nThe problem states that the maximum power radiated is A. This maximum occurs at θ = 90°, where sin²(90°) = 1.\n\nTo find the fraction of A radiated at an angle of θ = 30°, we calculate the value of sin²(30°):\n\n*   sin(30°) = 1/2\n*   sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4\n\nTherefore, the power radiated at 30° is 1/4 of the maximum power A.\n\n### Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is also dependent on the frequency (ω) or wavelength (λ) of the oscillation. The total radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (ω⁴).\n\nSince the angular frequency ω is related to the wavelength λ by ω = 2πc/λ (where c is the speed of light), the power dependence can be expressed in terms of wavelength:\n\n*   Power ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴\n\nThis λ⁻⁴ relationship is a classic result for dipole radiation and is also the reason for phenomena like Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue. The function *f*, representing the power per unit solid angle, will share this same wavelength dependence.\n\nCombining these two findings, the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at θ = 30° is 1/4, and a possible form for the wavelength dependence of the radiated power function *f* is λ⁻⁴.\n\n<<<A>>>"
