    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Abundance Notation\n\nThe notation `[A/B]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of two elements, A and B, in a star relative to the Sun. It is defined as:\n\n`[A/B] = log10( (n_A / n_B)_star ) - log10( (n_A / n_B)_sun )`\n\nwhere `n_A` and `n_B` are the number densities of elements A and B, respectively.\n\nA useful property of this notation is the ability to chain different elemental ratios:\n\n`[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]`\n\n### 2. Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star 1\n\nWe are given the following for Star 1:\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0` dex\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3` dex\n\nWe want to find the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio, `[Si/H]_1`. We can use the chaining property mentioned above:\n\n`[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1`\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\nThis equation tells us the relationship between the silicon abundance in Star 1 and the Sun:\n\n`log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) = 0.3`\n`log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) = 0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun )`\n`(n_Si / n_H)_1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star 2\n\nFor Star 2, we are given:\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0` dex\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3` dex\n\nWe need to find `[Si/H]_2`. We can rearrange the chaining rule: `[Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2`.\n\n`[Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2`\n`[Si/H]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3`\n\nNow, we can relate the silicon abundance in Star 2 to that of the Sun:\n\n`log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) = -0.3`\n`log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) = -0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun )`\n`(n_Si / n_H)_2 = 10^-0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Final Ratio\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star 1 and Star 2. This corresponds to the ratio of their silicon abundances relative to hydrogen.\n\nRatio = `(n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`\n\nSubstitute the expressions we found in the previous steps:\n\nRatio = `( 10^0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) / ( 10^-0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun )`\n\nThe solar abundance term `(n_Si / n_H)_sun` cancels out:\n\nRatio = `10^0.3 / 10^-0.3`\nRatio = `10^(0.3 - (-0.3))`\nRatio = `10^0.6`\n\nCalculating the final value:\n\nRatio â‰ˆ 3.981\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9. The information regarding the stellar masses and the specific solar abundance values for Fe and Mg are not required for this calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
