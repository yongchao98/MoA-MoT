    "The search results confirm the standard procedure for calculating the pH of a phosphate buffer and the concentrations of its species. The primary buffer system is H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻, governed by Ka₂. The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is then determined by the third dissociation equilibrium, which is governed by Ka₃. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the appropriate tool for these calculations. The methodology I outlined in the thought process is correct. I can now proceed with presenting the final answer based on my calculations.\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻), we must first calculate the concentrations of the primary buffer components and the pH of the solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the moles of each salt:**\n*   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n**2. Calculate the initial molar concentrations:**\nThe volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n*   KH₂PO₄ provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻), the acid component of the buffer.\n    [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O provides the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻), the conjugate base component.\n    [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\nThe pH of this buffer is governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄), which involves the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ conjugate pair and the equilibrium constant Ka₂.\nThe equilibrium is: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\nThe equilibrium expression is: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] = 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4. Calculate the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) concentration:**\nThe concentration of orthophosphate (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, which is governed by Ka₃.\nThe equilibrium is: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\nThe equilibrium expression is: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] = 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
