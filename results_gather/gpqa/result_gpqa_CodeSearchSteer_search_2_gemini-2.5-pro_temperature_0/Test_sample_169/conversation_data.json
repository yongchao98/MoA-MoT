    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, ⟨S_y⟩, for an electron in the spin state |ψ⟩ = (3i, 4), we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Normalize the spin state vector.**\n    The given unnormalized state is |ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]ᵀ.\n    The corresponding bra is ⟨ψ| = [-3i, 4].\n    The squared norm is ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25.\n    The normalization constant is N = 1/√25 = 1/5.\n    The normalized state is |ψ_norm⟩ = (1/5) * [3i, 4]ᵀ.\n\n2.  **Define the spin operator S_y.**\n    The spin operator S_y is given by S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix for spin in the y-direction.\n    Given σ_y =\n    ```\n    ( 0  -i )\n    ( i   0 )\n    ```\n    So, S_y = (ħ/2) *\n    ```\n    ( 0  -i )\n    ( i   0 )\n    ```\n\n3.  **Calculate the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩.**\n    The expectation value is calculated using the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ_norm|S_y|ψ_norm⟩.\n\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (1/5) * [-3i, 4] * [ (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] ] * (1/5) * [[3i],]\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * [-3i, 4] * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [[3i],]\n\n    First, we compute the product of the matrix and the ket vector:\n    [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [[3i],] = [[0*(3i) + (-i)*4], [i*(3i) + 0*4]] = [[-4i], [3i²]] = [[-4i], [-3]]\n\n    Next, we multiply this result by the bra vector:\n    [-3i, 4] * [[-4i], [-3]] = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12i² - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24.\n\n    Finally, we include the constant factor:\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * (-24) = -24ħ/50 = -12ħ/25.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) -25*hbar/2\nB) 25*hbar/2\nC) 12*hbar/25\nD) -12*hbar/25\n\nThe calculated expectation value is -12ħ/25, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
