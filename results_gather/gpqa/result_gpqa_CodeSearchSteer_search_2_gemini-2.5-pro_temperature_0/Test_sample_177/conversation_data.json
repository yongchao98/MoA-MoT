    "To determine the mass dimension of κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we will analyze the provided Lagrangian interaction term.\n\n### 1. Mass Dimension of κ\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action `S` is dimensionless. The action is the integral of the Lagrangian density `L` over four-dimensional spacetime: `S = ∫d⁴x L`.\n\n*   The spacetime volume element `d⁴x` has a mass dimension of [d⁴x] = -4.\n*   For the action `S` to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension of [L] = 4. This applies to any term in the Lagrangian, including the interaction term `L_int`.\n\nThe interaction Lagrangian is given by:\n`L_int = κ * ψ_bar * σ_μν * ψ * F^μν`\n\nTherefore, `[L_int]` must be equal to 4.\n`[κ] + [ψ_bar] + [σ_μν] + [ψ] + [F^μν] = 4`\n\nNow, let's determine the mass dimension of each component:\n\n*   **Fermion field (ψ):** The kinetic term for a fermion in the Lagrangian is `ψ_bar * (iγ^μ * ∂_μ - m) * ψ`. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, and knowing the derivative `∂_μ` has a mass dimension of 1, the fermion field `ψ` must have a mass dimension of 3/2. Thus, `[ψ] = [ψ_bar] = 3/2`.\n*   **Field strength tensor (F^μν):** The kinetic term for the gauge field in the Lagrangian is `-1/4 * F_μν * F^μν`. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, the field strength tensor `F^μν` must have a mass dimension of 2. So, `[F^μν] = 2`.\n*   **Sigma matrix (σ_μν):** This is defined as `σ_μν = (i/2) * [γ_μ, γ_ν]`. The gamma matrices `γ_μ` are dimensionless matrices. Therefore, `σ_μν` is also dimensionless.\n\nNow we can substitute these dimensions back into the equation for `[L_int]`:\n\n`[κ] + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 4`\n`[κ] + 3 + 2 = 4`\n`[κ] + 5 = 4`\n`[κ] = -1`\n\nSo, the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ is -1.\n\n### 2. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nA key criterion for determining if a theory is renormalizable is power-counting, which looks at the mass dimensions of the coupling constants.\n\n*   If all coupling constants in the Lagrangian have a mass dimension greater than or equal to zero, the theory is generally considered **renormalizable** (or super-renormalizable if the dimension is strictly positive).\n*   If any coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is **non-renormalizable**. This is because interactions with negative mass dimension couplings become stronger at higher energies, leading to uncontrollable divergences in perturbative calculations.\n\nSince we found that `[κ] = -1`, which is a negative mass dimension, the theory described by this interaction is non-renormalizable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
