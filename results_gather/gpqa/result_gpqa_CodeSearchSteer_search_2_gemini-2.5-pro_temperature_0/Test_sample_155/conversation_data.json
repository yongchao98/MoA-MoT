    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene. Treatment with mCPBA results in a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom to the double bond. This stereospecific reaction converts the *trans*-alkene into a *trans*-epoxide. Because the attack can happen from either face of the alkene, a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides, (4R,5R)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, is formed.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an Sₙ2-type reaction where the water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the oxygen atom, causing an inversion of stereochemistry at the site of attack.\n    *   Attack on the (4R,5R)-epoxide at either carbon results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack on the (4S,5S)-epoxide at either carbon results in the formation of (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    These two products, (4R,5S) and (4S,5R), are identical. This product has two chiral centers but also has a plane of symmetry, making it a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, a *cis*-alkene. The *syn*-addition of oxygen from mCPBA converts the *cis*-alkene into a *cis*-epoxide. This epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, is a meso compound itself.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The acid-catalyzed hydrolysis opens the meso-epoxide. The water nucleophile can attack either of the two carbons of the protonated epoxide.\n    *   Attack at one carbon results in an inversion of configuration, leading to the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol enantiomer.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon also causes an inversion, leading to the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol enantiomer.\n    Since the starting epoxide is achiral, attacks on either side are equally probable, producing a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers. This is a **racemic mixture**.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the product from Reaction 1 (the meso compound) with the product from Reaction 2 (the racemic mixture). The final mixture therefore contains three stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (meso)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer)\n\nThe (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are enantiomers of each other. The meso isomer is a diastereomer of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers (the meso compound and the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties and will be separated, resulting in different retention times.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Consequently, the chemist will observe **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This method uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The meso compound will produce a single peak.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will be separated from each other, each giving a distinct peak.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated from them.\n    *   Therefore, the chemist will observe **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the standard HPLC will show 2 peaks, and the chiral HPLC will show 3 peaks.\n\n<<<B>>>"
