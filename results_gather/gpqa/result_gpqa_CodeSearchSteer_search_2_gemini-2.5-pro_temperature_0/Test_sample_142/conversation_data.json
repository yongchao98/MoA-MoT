    "The Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement is a classic reaction in organic chemistry where a 1,2-diol (a molecule with two hydroxyl or -OH groups on adjacent carbons) is converted into a ketone under acidic conditions. The reaction mechanism involves the protonation of one hydroxyl group, which then leaves as a water molecule to form a carbocation. This is followed by a 1,2-shift of a group (like an alkyl, aryl, or hydride) from the adjacent carbon to the carbocation center. This rearrangement results in a more stable, resonance-stabilized cation that then deprotonates to form the final ketone product.\n\nHere is the analysis of the two reactions in question:\n\n**Reaction 1: A + H₂SO₄ → 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one**\n\nThe product is a cyclohexanone, a six-membered ring containing a ketone. It has two *p*-tolyl groups on the carbon next to the carbonyl group (C2). This structure is the result of a ring-expansion reaction.\n\n1.  **Starting Material 'A'**: The starting material must be a cyclopentane derivative that can expand into a cyclohexane ring. The correct starting material is **1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol**.\n2.  **Mechanism**:\n    *   The hydroxyl group on the exocyclic carbon (the one attached to the two *p*-tolyl groups) is protonated by the acid and leaves as water. This forms a highly stable tertiary carbocation, which is also stabilized by resonance with the two aromatic *p*-tolyl rings.\n    *   A carbon-carbon bond from the adjacent cyclopentane ring (C1-C5) then migrates to this electron-deficient carbon. This expands the five-membered ring into a six-membered ring.\n    *   This migration leaves a positive charge on the carbon that was part of the original cyclopentane ring (C1), which still has the other hydroxyl group attached.\n    *   This intermediate is the protonated form of the final ketone. Loss of a proton from the oxygen yields the product, **2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Reaction 2: methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H₂SO₄ → B**\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: The starting material is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-C(OH)(*p*-tolyl)-COOCH₃.\n2.  **Mechanism**:\n    *   The reaction involves choosing which hydroxyl group to protonate. The hydroxyl on C2 is tertiary, while the one on C3 is secondary. Protonation and loss of water from C2 will form a more stable tertiary carbocation, which is also stabilized by the adjacent *p*-tolyl group.\n    *   Once the carbocation is formed at C2, a group must migrate from the adjacent carbon, C3. The groups on C3 are a hydrogen atom (H) and a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   Based on migratory aptitude, a hydride ion (H⁻) is more likely to migrate than a methyl group.\n    *   A 1,2-hydride shift occurs from C3 to C2. This transfers the positive charge to C3, which now has a hydroxyl group attached.\n    *   The oxygen of the hydroxyl group on C3 forms a double bond with the carbon, and a proton is lost to form a ketone.\n    *   The resulting product 'B' is **methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**.\n\nBased on this analysis, starting material 'A' is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol and product 'B' is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
