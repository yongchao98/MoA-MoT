    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we will use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n**1. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Position and Momentum:**\n\nThe principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a particle's position (Δx) and the uncertainty in its momentum (Δp) must be greater than or equal to a constant value. The mathematical expression is:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   **Δx** is the uncertainty in position.\n*   **Δp** is the uncertainty in momentum.\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck's constant (h / 2π), approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\n**2. Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):**\n\nFrom the given information, the uncertainty in the electron's location is Δx = 0.1 nm = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁰ m. We can calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum as follows:\n\nΔp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\nΔp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n**3. Relate Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp) to Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE):**\n\nFor a particle moving at a velocity (v), the uncertainty in its kinetic energy (ΔE) can be related to the uncertainty in its momentum (Δp) by the following approximation, which is derived from the energy-momentum relation:\n\nΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\nThis relationship holds for both non-relativistic and relativistic speeds.\n\n**4. Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE):**\n\nUsing the given speed of the electron, v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s, and the calculated uncertainty in momentum, we can estimate the minimum uncertainty in energy:\n\nΔE ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\nΔE ≈ 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\nΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe estimated minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron is approximately 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J. This value is closest to the option ~10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<C>>>"
