    "To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we must apply the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the energy quantization in an infinite well and the Pauli exclusion principle for fermions.\n\n### Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by:\nE_n = (n² * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²)\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...)\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck's constant\n*   `m` is the mass of the particle\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E = (π² * ħ²) / (2mL²). Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\nE_n = n² * E\n\n### Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nSince the particles are identical spin-1/2 particles (fermions), they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by its quantum numbers, which in this case are the energy level `n` and the spin (up or down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Calculating the System Energies\n\n**Ground State Energy (E_gs)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy E₁ = 1²E = E):** We can place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy E₂ = 2²E = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\nE_gs = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n**First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nTo get the first excited state, we move one particle from the highest occupied level in the ground state to the next available unoccupied level.\n*   The ground state configuration is two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.\n*   We excite one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level (Energy E₃ = 3²E = 9E).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n**Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nFor the second excited state, we must find the next possible energy configuration above the first excited state. We can consider different ways to excite the system from the ground state:\n1.  **Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3:**\n    *   Configuration: one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = **18E**\n2.  **Excite two particles from n=2 to n=3:**\n    *   Configuration: two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**\n3.  **Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4:**\n    *   Configuration: two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4 (Energy E₄ = 4²E = 16E).\n    *   Total Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**\n\nComparing these energies (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest energy above the first excited state (15E) is 18E. Therefore, the second excited state energy is **18E**.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<C>>>"
