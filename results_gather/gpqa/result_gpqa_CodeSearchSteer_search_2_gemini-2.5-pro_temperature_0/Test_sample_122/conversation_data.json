    "The search results confirm the physics principles I used.\n\n1.  **Reference Frames**: The problem involves two inertial reference frames: the Galaxy's and the ejecta's.\n2.  **Time Dilation**: A clock moving relative to an observer is measured to tick slower. The time measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock) is the proper time, Δt₀. The time measured in the stationary frame (the Galaxy's clock) is Δt. The relationship is Δt = γ * Δt₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. The formula for the Lorentz factor is γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n3.  **The Question**: The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels *in the Galaxy reference frame*.\n4.  **Calculation**: This distance (`d`) is the ejecta's velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (`Δt`).\n    *   `d = v * Δt`\n    *   Since `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, the formula becomes `d = v * γ * Δt₀`.\n\nLet's re-verify the calculation steps:\n\n*   **Given**:\n    *   `v = 60,000 km/s`\n    *   `Δt₀ = 50 s` (time in the ejecta's frame, which is the moving frame)\n    *   `c = 300,000 km/s` (approximate speed of light)\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio v/c.**\n    *   `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    *   `γ = 1 / √(1 - (v/c)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n    *   `√0.96 ≈ 0.9797959`\n    *   `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9797959 ≈ 1.02062`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d).**\n    *   `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\n*   **Alternative Calculation**:\n    *   `d = γ * (v * Δt₀)`\n    *   `d ≈ 1.02062 * (60,000 km/s * 50 s)`\n    *   `d ≈ 1.02062 * 3,000,000 km`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,860 km.\n\n*   **Compare with options**:\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is extremely close to option B. The minor difference of 1,860 km (about 0.06%) is negligible and likely due to rounding in the problem's design.\n\nAs noted in the initial thought process, a simple logical check also points to B. The classical distance would be `v * Δt₀ = 3,000,000 km` (Option C). Due to time dilation, the time measured in the Galaxy frame (`Δt`) is longer than the time in the ejecta frame (`Δt₀`). Therefore, the distance measured in the Galaxy frame (`v * Δt`) must be greater than 3,000,000 km. Option B is the only choice that satisfies this condition.\n\nThe physics and the calculation are sound.\n\nFinal check of the question: \"What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\"\n- Distance in Galaxy frame = `d_G`\n- Velocity = `v`\n- Time in Galaxy frame = `t_G`\n- Time in ejecta frame = `t_E` = 50 s\n- `d_G = v * t_G`\n- `t_G = γ * t_E`\n- `d_G = v * γ * t_E`\n- `d_G = 60,000 * (1/sqrt(1-0.2^2)) * 50`\n- `d_G = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`\n- `d_G ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nThe result is consistent. Option B is the correct answer.\n\nTo solve this problem, we must apply the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference.** We have the ejecta's reference frame (the moving frame) and the Galaxy's reference frame (the stationary frame).\n\n2.  **Identify the given values.**\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is the proper time, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Understand the goal.** We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. This distance, `d`, is calculated as `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n4.  **Calculate the time dilation.** According to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure a longer time interval for an event occurring in a moving frame. This is called time dilation. The formula is:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is given by:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate γ:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n        `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n6.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d).**\n    *   `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\n8.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 3,061,800 km is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\nA simpler logical check also confirms this. The non-relativistic distance would be `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option C). Because of time dilation, the time measured in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds, so the distance traveled must be greater than 3,000,000 km. Only option B is greater than 3,000,000 km.\n\n<<<B>>>"
