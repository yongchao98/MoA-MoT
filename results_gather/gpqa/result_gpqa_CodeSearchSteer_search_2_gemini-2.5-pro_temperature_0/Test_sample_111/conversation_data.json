    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Normalize the state |α>**\n\nThe given state is `|α'> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. To find the probabilities, the state vector must be normalized. Let the normalized state be `|α> = C|α'>`. The normalization condition is `<α|α> = 1`.\n\nThe inner product is calculated as:\n`<α'|α'> = [(1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down|] * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n`<α'|α'> = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)`\n`<α'|α'> = (1 - i²) + (4 - i²) = (1 + 1) + (4 + 1) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nSo, `|C|² * 7 = 1`, which means `C = 1/√7`.\n\nThe normalized state is:\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nIn matrix notation, where `|up> = [1, 0]` and `|down> = [0, 1]`, the state is:\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n\n**2. Define the Operator A and find its Eigenstates and Eigenvalues**\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements `Aij = ħ/2` for `i ≠ j` and `Aii = 0`. This gives the matrix:\n`A = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis is `(ħ/2)` times the Pauli-X matrix (`σ_x`).\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -λ ]]) = 0`\n`λ² - (ħ/2)² = 0`\n`λ = ± ħ/2`\n\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +ħ/2` and `λ₂ = -ħ/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n*   For `λ₁ = +ħ/2`:\n    `(A - λ₁I)v₁ = 0` => `(ħ/2) * [[-1, 1], [1, -1]] * [x, y] = 0`\n    This gives `-x + y = 0`, so `x = y`. The normalized eigenvector is `|v₁> = (1/√2) * [1, 1]`.\n\n*   For `λ₂ = -ħ/2`:\n    `(A - λ₂I)v₂ = 0` => `(ħ/2) * [[1, 1], [1, 1]] * [x, y] = 0`\n    This gives `x + y = 0`, so `x = -y`. The normalized eigenvector is `|v₂> = (1/√2) * [1, -1]`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probabilities**\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue `λ_i` is given by `P(λ_i) = |<v_i|α>|²`.\n\n*   **Probability of measuring `λ₁ = +ħ/2` (P₁):**\n    `<v₁|α> = (1/√2) * [1, 1] * (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n    `<v₁|α> = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)]`\n    `<v₁|α> = (1/√14) * [1 + i + 2 - i] = 3/√14`\n    `P₁ = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643`\n\n*   **Probability of measuring `λ₂ = -ħ/2` (P₂):**\n    `<v₂|α> = (1/√2) * [1, -1] * (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n    `<v₂|α> = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)]`\n    `<v₂|α> = (1/√14) * [1 + i - 2 + i] = (-1 + 2i)/√14`\n    `P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n**4. Calculate the Average Value of the Operator**\n\nThe average (or expectation) value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways:\n\n*   **Method 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities**\n    `<A> = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂`\n    `<A> = (9/14)*(ħ/2) + (5/14)*(-ħ/2)`\n    `<A> = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5) = 4ħ/28 = ħ/7`\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the formula `<A> = <α|A|α>`**\n    `<A> = (1/√7) * [1-i, 2+i] * (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n    `<A> = (ħ/14) * [1-i, 2+i] * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n    `<A> = (ħ/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n    `<A> = (ħ/14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)]`\n    `<A> = (ħ/14) * [(1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i)]`\n    `<A> = (ħ/14) * 2 = ħ/7`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is `ħ/7`. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
