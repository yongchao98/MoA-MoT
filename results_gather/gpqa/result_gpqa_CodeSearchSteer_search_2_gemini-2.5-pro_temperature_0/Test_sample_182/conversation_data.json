    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to understand the starting material and the reaction it undergoes.\n\n**1. The Reactant: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**\n\nLet's break down the structure to determine its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group is at position 1.\n*   **Formyl:** A -CHO (aldehyde) group is at position 2.\n*   **Vinyl:** A -CH=CH2 group is at position 5.\n\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is C10H12O3. We can calculate its IHD to verify the structure's features:\n*   IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 5.\n*   This corresponds to one ring, one double bond in the ring, one double bond in the vinyl group, one C=O in the formyl group, and one C=O in the carboxylic acid group (1+1+1+1+1 = 5).\n\n**2. The Reaction: Reduction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI**\n\nThe combination of red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI) is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce a wide range of oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturated bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a single bond.\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group will be reduced, converting the vinyl group into an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n**3. The Product**\n\nThe reaction completely removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all double bonds, without breaking the carbon ring. The carbon skeleton of the reactant (C10) remains intact. The final product is a saturated cycloalkane with the following structure:\n*   A cyclohexane ring.\n*   A methyl group at position 1 (from the original carboxylic acid).\n*   A methyl group at position 2 (from the original formyl group).\n*   An ethyl group at position 5 (from the original vinyl group).\n\nThe resulting molecule is a substituted cyclohexane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n. Since the product has 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula will be C10H20.\n\n**4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD, also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated from the molecular formula using the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\nFor the product C10H20:\n*   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\n*   IHD = 11 - 10\n*   IHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 indicates the presence of either one ring or one double bond. Since the product is a fully saturated cycloalkane (1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane, based on IUPAC naming of the product), the IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring in its structure.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
