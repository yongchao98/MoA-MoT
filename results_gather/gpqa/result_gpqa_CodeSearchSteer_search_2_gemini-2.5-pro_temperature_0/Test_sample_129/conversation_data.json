    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds so they can be detected by ground-based optical telescopes, we need to consider two key factors: the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line and the atmospheric cutoff for optical observations from the ground.\n\n1.  **Lyman-alpha Wavelength**: Neutral hydrogen absorbs light at the specific Lyman-alpha (Lyα) wavelength, which is approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å) or 121.6 nanometers. This wavelength is in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Atmospheric Cutoff**: The Earth's atmosphere blocks most ultraviolet radiation. Ground-based optical telescopes are limited by this atmospheric absorption, particularly by ozone, which creates a \"cutoff\" at the blue end of the spectrum. While the visible spectrum for humans is roughly 4000 Å to 7000 Å, optical telescopes can observe at slightly shorter wavelengths. However, for practical purposes in obtaining a clear signal, the effective lower limit for ground-based optical astronomy is often considered to be around 3200 Å to 3500 Å. Observations below this range are not feasible from the ground.\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation**: The redshift (denoted by 'z') describes how much the wavelength of light from a distant object is stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The formula relating the rest wavelength (λ_rest) and the observed wavelength (λ_observed) is: z = (λ_observed - λ_rest) / λ_rest.\n\nTo find the minimum redshift, we need to calculate the 'z' value that would shift the 1216 Å Lyman-alpha line just into the observable window. Using a practical atmospheric cutoff of ~3500 Å as our minimum observed wavelength:\n\n*   λ_rest = 1216 Å\n*   λ_observed = 3500 Å\n\nPlugging these values into the redshift formula:\n\nz = (3500 Å - 1216 Å) / 1216 Å\nz = 2284 / 1216\nz ≈ 1.878\n\nThis calculated redshift of approximately 1.88 is very close to the provided option of 1.9. A redshift of this magnitude would shift the Lyman-alpha absorption feature to about 3526 Å, placing it within a range that is detectable by ground-based optical telescopes.\n\n<<<A>>>"
