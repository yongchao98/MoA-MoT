    "Based on the provided 1H NMR data, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**. Here is a detailed analysis of the spectrum leading to this conclusion:\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet):** This signal, integrating to three protons and appearing as a singlet (s), is characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (CH₃-C=O). The singlet multiplicity is due to the absence of adjacent protons for coupling.\n\n*   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is in the vinylic region, indicating a proton on a carbon-carbon double bond. The significant downfield shift to 7.0 ppm is caused by the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen atom in the enol acetate structure (-O-CH=). The large coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz is a definitive indicator of a *trans* configuration between the two vinylic protons. *Cis* alkenes typically show a smaller coupling constant, usually in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n\n*   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quartets):** This is the second vinylic proton. Its multiplicity as a doublet of quartets (dq) reveals its coupling partners. It is split into a doublet by the other vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm) and into a quartet by the three protons of an adjacent methyl group.\n\n*   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet):** This signal corresponds to a methyl group (CH₃) that is adjacent to a single proton, causing it to be split into a doublet (d). This confirms the `CH₃-CH=` structural fragment.\n\n**Structure Elucidation:**\n\nAssembling these pieces of information leads to the structure of **trans-propenyl acetate**:\n\n`CH₃(c)-CH(b)=CH(a)-O-C(=O)-CH₃(d)`\n\n*   **Protons (d):** 2.1 ppm (s, 3H)\n*   **Proton (a):** 7.0 ppm (d, 1H) - Coupled to H(b)\n*   **Proton (b):** 5.5 ppm (dq, 1H) - Coupled to H(a) and the three H(c) protons\n*   **Protons (c):** 1.6 ppm (d, 3H) - Coupled to H(b)\n\nThe other options are inconsistent with the data:\n*   **Cis-propenyl acetate** would show a much smaller J-coupling constant for the vinylic protons.\n*   **Cis- and Trans-butenyl acetate** (assuming but-2-enyl acetate) would have a different NMR spectrum. Specifically, the signal for the -CH₂- group attached to the acetate oxygen would appear around 4.5 ppm, and neither vinylic proton would be shifted as far downfield as 7.0 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the data uniquely identifies the compound as Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
