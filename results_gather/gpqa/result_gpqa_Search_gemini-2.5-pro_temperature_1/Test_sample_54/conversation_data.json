    "Here is a step-by-step identification of the unknown compound based on the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n### Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet integrating to three protons is characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃) that is not adjacent to any protons, hence no splitting. This chemical shift is typical for the methyl protons of an acetate group (CH₃COO-). All four possible compounds contain an acetate group, so this signal confirms the presence of this functional group.\n\n2.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (CH₃) coupled to a single proton on an adjacent carbon (a CH group). This pattern is consistent with a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond, like in a propenyl group (CH₃-CH=).\n\n3.  **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm:** These signals are in the chemical shift range for vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a single proton split into a doublet by a neighboring proton. The key piece of information here is the coupling constant, *J* = 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants for vinylic protons are dependent on their stereochemistry. A large coupling constant, typically in the range of 11-18 Hz, is indicative of a *trans* relationship between the two protons. Cis protons, by contrast, show smaller coupling constants, usually between 6-12 Hz. This strongly suggests a *trans* configuration.\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal for a single proton is a doublet of quartets. This means it is being split by two different sets of neighboring protons. The doublet (\"d\") portion arises from coupling to the other single vinylic proton (the one at 7.0 ppm). The quartet (\"q\") portion arises from coupling to a group of three equivalent protons, which corresponds to the methyl group at 1.6 ppm.\n\n### Assembling the Structure:\n\n*   The data points to a propenyl group (CH₃-CH=CH-) rather than a butenyl group. A propenyl acetate structure (CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃) fits the observed signals and their splitting patterns perfectly.\n    *   The methyl group of the acetate is the singlet at 2.1 ppm.\n    *   The methyl group on the double bond is the doublet at 1.6 ppm.\n    *   The proton adjacent to this methyl group is the doublet of quartets at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   The proton adjacent to the oxygen is the doublet at 7.0 ppm.\n*   The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the two vinylic protons at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm definitively establishes their relative stereochemistry as *trans*.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the chemical shifts, integration, splitting patterns, and particularly the large coupling constant of the vinylic protons, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
