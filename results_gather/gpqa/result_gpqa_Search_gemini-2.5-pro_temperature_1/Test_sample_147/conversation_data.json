    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and substance A2.**\n    A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (formula YF&#x208_n) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The mass percentage can be expressed as:\n    `%F = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F) * 100`\n    Where `M_Y` is the atomic mass of element Y, `M_F` is the atomic mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol), and `n` is the number of fluorine atoms.\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for `M_Y`:\n    `M_Y = (n * M_F * (100 - %F)) / %F`\n    `M_Y = (n * 19.00 * (100 - 31.96)) / 31.96`\n    `M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n`\n\n    We can test integer values for `n` to find a plausible element Y:\n    *   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 (resembles Calcium)\n    *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.90 (resembles Bromine)\n    *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 (resembles Antimony, Sb, with an atomic mass of 121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n=4: M_Y ≈ 161.80\n    *   n=5: M_Y ≈ 202.25\n\n    The best fit is for n=3, where Y is Antimony (Sb). Let's verify the fluorine percentage for Antimony trifluoride (SbF₃):\n    M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    %F = (3 * 19.00 / 178.76) * 100 = 31.89%.\n    This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, confirming that **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Identify substances A1 and A3.**\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine (`A1 -> SbF₃ + F₂`). This indicates A1 is a higher fluoride of antimony, which is Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). A1 also oxidizes xenon, a known property of strong fluorinating agents like SbF₅ (`2SbF₅ + Xe -> [XeF][Sb₂F₁₁]`). While pure SbF₅ is colorless, the color mentioned might be due to impurities or specific conditions. The low decomposition temperature suggests high reactivity.\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorinating antimony (`Sb + F₂ -> A3`) and also reacts with xenon. The fluorination of antimony can yield SbF₃ and then SbF₅. Since A3 reacts with xenon, it must be the stronger oxidant, **SbF₅**. Thus, A1 and A3 are the same substance.\n\n3.  **Identify substances A4 and A5.**\n    *   The problem states that A5 is obtained by adding Y (Antimony, Sb) to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio (`Sb + A4 -> A5`).\n    *   This is a reaction where elemental antimony (oxidation state 0) is added to a solution of another antimony compound (A4). This strongly suggests an oxidation-reduction reaction, where Sb(0) is oxidized. Therefore, A4 must be an oxidizing agent.\n    *   In this chemical system, the oxidizing species would be Antimony(V). The most likely candidates for A4 are therefore SbF₅ or a related compound.\n    *   The description \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" points towards Fluoroantimonic acid (HSbF₆), which is a superacid formed by mixing SbF₅ with hydrogen fluoride (HF). It exists as a colorless solution.\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the possible candidates for A4 against the given options:\n        *   **SbF₃**: 178.76 g/mol. This falls into range A (160-180). However, A4 must be an oxidant for Sb(0), making Sb(III)F₃ a chemically inconsistent choice.\n        *   **SbF₅**: 216.76 g/mol. This value does not fall into any of the ranges.\n        *   **HSbF₆**: 1.01 + 121.76 + 6 * 19.00 = 236.77 g/mol. This molecular weight falls perfectly within **range B (220-240)**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on its chemical role as an oxidant for elemental antimony and its description as a colorless solution, combined with the molecular weight calculation, A4 is identified as Fluoroantimonic acid (HSbF₆). The product A5 would be a compound of Antimony(III), likely SbF₃, which is known to decompose in water into two substances (e.g., SbOF and HF). The molecular weight of A4 (HSbF₆) is approximately 237 g/mol, which is in the range of 220-240 g/mol.\n\nThe molecular weight of the substance A4 falls in the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<B>>>"
