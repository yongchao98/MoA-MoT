    "The reaction sequence is as follows:\n\n1.  **Toluene to Product 1:** Toluene reacts with nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. This is a nitration reaction. The methyl group is an ortho, para-director, with the major product typically being the para isomer due to less steric hindrance. Therefore, Product 1 is *p*-nitrotoluene.\n\n2.  **Product 1 to Product 2:** *p*-Nitrotoluene is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a strong oxidizing condition that converts the methyl group (-CH₃) on the benzene ring to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The nitro group (-NO₂) is unaffected. Thus, Product 2 is *p*-nitrobenzoic acid.\n\n3.  **Product 2 to Product 3:** *p*-Nitrobenzoic acid is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). In the presence of a base and a reducing agent (acetone can act as one in this context), nitroarenes can undergo reductive coupling. Two molecules of *p*-nitrobenzoic acid react to form the more thermodynamically stable *trans*-azobenzene derivative. The final product, Product 3, is *trans*-4,4'-azobenzenedicarboxylic acid.\n\n**Symmetry of Product 3 (*trans*-4,4'-azobenzenedicarboxylic acid):**\n\nTo determine the molecular symmetry group, we analyze the symmetry elements of the *trans*-4,4'-azobenzenedicarboxylic acid molecule:\n*   The molecule has a center of inversion (*i*) at the midpoint of the nitrogen-nitrogen double bond.\n*   It has a two-fold axis of rotation (C₂) that passes through the center of inversion and is perpendicular to the plane of the molecule.\n*   It also has a mirror plane (σh) which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n\nA point group that contains a C₂ axis and a center of inversion (*i*) is the **C₂h** group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is C₂h.\n\n<<<A>>>"
