    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a local quantum field theory that extends the Standard Model. As such, it must adhere to certain fundamental symmetries.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: The operators in SMEFT are constructed to be invariant under Lorentz transformations. This is a foundational requirement for any relativistic quantum field theory, ensuring that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers.\n\n2.  **Poincaré Symmetry**: This symmetry group includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) as well as spacetime translations. The SMEFT Lagrangian, being built from local operators, respects Poincaré symmetry.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry**: CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is violated in the Standard Model. SMEFT, as an extension, not only incorporates this violation but also allows for new sources of CP violation through higher-dimensional operators. Therefore, not all operators in SMEFT are required to be CP-symmetric.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry**: According to the CPT theorem, any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT (Charge-Parity-Time) symmetric. Since SMEFT adheres to these principles, its operators must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nBased on this, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
