    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the total mass of each binary system and then find their ratio.\n\n### 1. The Physics of Binary Stars\n\nThe total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be determined using a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law. For a system where both stars' radial velocities can be measured, the total mass (M = m₁ + m₂) is given by:\n\nM = [P / (2πG * sin³(i))] * (K₁ + K₂ )³\n\nWhere:\n*   **M** is the total mass of the system.\n*   **P** is the orbital period.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n*   **K₁** and **K₂** are the amplitudes of the radial velocity variations for each star.\n*   **i** is the orbital inclination (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n### 2. Simplifying for Eclipsing Systems\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a crucial piece of information. For an eclipse to occur, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane of the stars. This means the inclination angle, *i*, is approximately 90 degrees.\n\nWhen *i* ≈ 90°, sin(*i*) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(*i*) ≈ 1. This simplifies the mass equation significantly, as the sin³(*i*) term can be omitted. The constants 2πG will be the same for both systems and will cancel out when we take the ratio.\n\nThus, the total mass of a system is directly proportional to its period and the cube of the sum of its radial velocity amplitudes:\n\nM ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\n### 3. Calculating the Masses\n\nNow we can apply this relationship to each system.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_sum₁): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   The mass of system 1 (M₁) is proportional to: M₁ ∝ 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_sum₂): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n*   The mass of system 2 (M₂) is proportional to: M₂ ∝ 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625\n\n### 4. Finding the Ratio\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which is the ratio M₁ / M₂.\n\nM₁ / M₂ = 6750 / 15625\n\nCalculating the value of this fraction:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4. This indicates that system_1 is actually less massive than system_2.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.2\nB) ~ 0.7\nC) ~ 0.4\nD) ~ 0.6\n\nThe calculated factor of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
