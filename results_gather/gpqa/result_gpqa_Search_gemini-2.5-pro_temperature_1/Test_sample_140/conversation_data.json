    "The reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide (NH2-), initiates the reaction by removing a proton or deuteron from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n\nThere are two possible pathways for this initial elimination step, leading to two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **H-abstraction:** The amide ion removes a hydrogen atom (H) from the C6 position. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, forming an intermediate called **3-deuterobenzyne**. In this intermediate, the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium atom remains at the C2 position.\n2.  **D-abstraction:** The amide ion removes the deuterium atom (D) from the C2 position. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, forming a different intermediate, **benzyne**. In this case, the triple bond is between C1 and C2, and the deuterium atom has been removed.\n\nEach of these two benzyne intermediates can then be attacked by a nucleophile (the amide ion, NH2-) in the addition step.\n\n*   **Addition to 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path 1):**\n    *   Attack at C1 yields **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 yields **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   This pathway produces two distinct products.\n\n*   **Addition to benzyne (from Path 2):**\n    *   Attack at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent, yields **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n    *   This pathway produces one distinct product.\n\nCombining the outcomes from both possible pathways, there are three unique organic products formed in this reaction:\n*   Aniline\n*   2-deuterioaniline\n*   3-deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products.\n\n<<<D>>>"
