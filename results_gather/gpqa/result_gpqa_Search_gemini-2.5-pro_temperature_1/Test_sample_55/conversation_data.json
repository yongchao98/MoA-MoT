    "To determine the correct transition route and probability for the decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions, we must apply the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Transition\nThe problem describes a two-step radiative cascade:\nInitial State: |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩, commonly known as the 3s state.\nFinal State: |n=1, l=0, m=0⟩, the ground state, or 1s state.\n\nThis process involves an intermediate state, |n', l', m'⟩. The decay happens through two successive electric dipole transitions.\n\n### 2. Applying Selection Rules\nThe selection rules for allowed electric dipole transitions are fundamental to determining the path. For a transition to occur, the change in the quantum numbers must satisfy:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly 1.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or 1.\n*   The principal quantum number *n* does not have a strict selection rule but must change (n' < n for decay).\n\n### 3. Determining the Transition Route\n**First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩**\n*   The initial state has l=0. According to the selection rule Δl = ±1, the intermediate state must have **l' = 1**.\n*   The initial state has m=0. The selection rule Δm = 0, ±1 allows the intermediate state to have **m' = 0, +1, or -1**.\n*   The options provided suggest the intermediate state has a principal quantum number **n' = 2**.\n*   Thus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩. These correspond to the 2p subshell.\n\n**Second Transition: |n',l',m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n*   The intermediate state has l'=1. The final state has l=0. This satisfies Δl = 0 - 1 = -1, which is an allowed transition.\n*   The intermediate state has m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}. The final state has m=0. The change Δm = 0 - m' must satisfy |Δm| ≤ 1. This condition is met for all three possible m' values.\n\nTherefore, three possible cascade routes exist:\n1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability\nThe question asks for the probability of a *specific* transition route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first decay step.\n\n*   The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of a photon.\n*   Consequently, the decay probability is distributed equally among all possible final magnetic sublevels (m').\n*   The l'=1 state has (2l'+1) = 3 magnetic sublevels (m' = -1, 0, 1).\n*   Assuming the decay from the 3s state primarily goes to the 2p subshell, the probability of transitioning into any single one of these three states is equal.\n*   Therefore, the branching ratio for the decay into any specific m' state is 1/3.\n\nThe second step of the cascade, from any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states, can only go to the |1,0,0⟩ ground state, as it is the only available lower energy level. Thus, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n\nThe total probability for any one of the specific routes is the product of the probabilities of each step:\nP(Route) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩) × P(|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\n*   A) Incorrect probability (2/3).\n*   B) Correct route and correct probability (1/3).\n*   C) Incorrect probability (1/4).\n*   D) Incorrect probability (1/4).\n\nThe only option that presents a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
