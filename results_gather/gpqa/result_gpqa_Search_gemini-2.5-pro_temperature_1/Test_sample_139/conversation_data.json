    "Based on the detailed analysis of the clues, the following substances have been identified:\n\n*   **Substance X:** Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄). This is a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry, and it contains a heavier isotope of hydrogen (deuterium).\n*   **Liquid Y:** Heavy water (D₂O). LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water, and the use of heavy water is necessary to produce the specified gas.\n*   **Gas W:** Deuterium gas (D₂). The reaction between LiAlD₄ and D₂O produces D₂ gas. A deuterium molecule (D₂) contains two protons and two neutrons, fulfilling the condition of having an equal number of each.\n*   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). This is the precipitate formed from the reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O.\n*   **Substance B:** Heavy water (D₂O). Heating aluminum deuteroxide (G) causes it to decompose, releasing heavy water (B). The melting point of heavy water is 3.82 °C (276.97 K), which is very close to the stated 277 K.\n\nThe problem asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n1.  **Identify the elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n2.  **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:**\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   Lithium (atomic number 3) is the intermediate element.\n3.  **Sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula:**\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of Hydrogen, present as Deuterium (D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of the most common isotope of aluminum is 27.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n4.  **Calculate the cumulative mass:**\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminum)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>"
