    "The reaction between an enol and a halogen like bromine is a classic example of α-halogenation of a ketone. The enol, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, is the less stable tautomer of the ketone 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Enols contain an electron-rich double bond and are highly reactive towards electrophiles such as bromine (Br₂).\n\nThe reaction proceeds via the following steps:\n1.  The electron-rich C=C double bond of the enol acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the bromine atoms in the Br₂ molecule.\n2.  This attack leads to the formation of a new carbon-bromine bond at the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group, which is C2 in this case).\n3.  Simultaneously or subsequently, the hydroxyl group's proton is removed, and the C=O double bond of the ketone is reformed.\n\nThis process results in the substitution of a hydrogen atom on the α-carbon with a bromine atom. For the starting material 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, the α-carbon is at the C2 position. The final product is therefore the α-brominated ketone.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol and C) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol represent products of electrophilic addition across the double bond without the reformation of the stable ketone group. While addition to an alkene is a possible reaction type, the reaction of an enol strongly favors the α-substitution pathway that results in the much more stable carbonyl compound.\n*   D) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone shows bromination at the C4 position. This position has no α-hydrogens to be substituted and is not activated for this type of reaction.\n*   B) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone is the product of α-halogenation, where the bromine has added to the C2 position (the α-carbon) and the enol has converted back to the ketone form. This is the expected major outcome for this reaction.\n\nTherefore, the major product is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\n<<<B>>>"
