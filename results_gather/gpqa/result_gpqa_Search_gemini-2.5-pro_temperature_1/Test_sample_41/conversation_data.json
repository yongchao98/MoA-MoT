    "Here is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit around its star is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where `T_star` is the star's temperature, `R_star` is its radius, `a` is the semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit), and `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n    When we take the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (e.g., Planet_i and Planet_j) orbiting the same star, the terms for the star's temperature and radius (`T_star` and `R_star`) cancel out. Since the problem states that the albedo (`A`) is the same for all three planets, the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` term also cancels out.\n\n    The relationship simplifies to:\n    `T_eq_i / T_eq_j = (a_j / a_i)^(1/2)`\n\n    By squaring both sides, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    `(T_eq_i / T_eq_j)^2 = a_j / a_i`\n\n2.  **Calculate the ratios of the semi-major axes.**\n    Using the given temperature ratios:\n    *   For Planet 1 and Planet 2: `T1 / T2 ≈ 1.4`\n        `a2 / a1 = (T1 / T2)^2 = 1.4^2 = 1.96`\n    *   For Planet 2 and Planet 3: `T2 / T3 ≈ 2.3`\n        `a3 / a2 = (T2 / T3)^2 = 2.3^2 = 5.29`\n\n    To find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1 (`a3 / a1`), we multiply the individual ratios:\n    `a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684`\n\n3.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law.**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) to its semi-major axis (`a`). For planets orbiting the same star, the law is:\n    `(P_i / P_j)^2 = (a_i / a_j)^3`\n\n    Taking the square root of both sides gives:\n    `P_i / P_j = (a_i / a_j)^(3/2)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods.**\n    We want to find the factor by which Planet 3's orbital period is larger than Planet 1's, which is the ratio `P3 / P1`.\n    `P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)`\n    `P3 / P1 = (10.3684)^(1.5)`\n    `P3 / P1 ≈ 33.38`\n\nThe result is approximately 33.4. The information about the planet masses and the TTV discovery method is not needed for this calculation, as the mass of the planets is typically negligible compared to the mass of the central star.\n\nTherefore, the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
