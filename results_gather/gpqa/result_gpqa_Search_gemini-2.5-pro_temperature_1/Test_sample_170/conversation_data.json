    "To arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must consider the directing effects and steric properties of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of Substituents\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on their electronic effects and how they direct incoming electrophiles:\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group (`-CH3`) is an activating, ortho-, para-director.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The ethoxycarbonyl group (`-COOC2H5`) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is a deactivating, ortho-, para-director.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (`-NO2`) is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is an activating, ortho-, para-director.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxyl group (`-COOH`) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n\n### Yield of the Para-Isomer\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (4, 2, 6):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer is extremely low. Among these, the `-NO2` group is the most strongly deactivating, leading to the highest selectivity for the meta position and thus the lowest yield of the para-isomer. The deactivating strength generally follows the order: `-NO2` > `-COOC2H5` ≈ `-COOH`. Therefore, the para-isomer yield will be lowest for nitrobenzene (4), followed by ethyl benzoate (2) and benzoic acid (6). While data for bromination of benzoic acid and its ester can be difficult to find and reactions often require harsh conditions, literature on nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution) shows ethyl benzoate gives about 5% para-isomer. We can infer a similar trend for bromination, placing these three at the beginning of the sequence.\n    *   **4 (Nitrobenzene):** ~0-5% para yield.\n    *   **2 (Ethyl benzoate):** Low para yield, likely slightly higher than nitrobenzene.\n    *   **6 (Benzoic acid):** Low para yield, comparable to ethyl benzoate.\n\n*   **Ortho-, para-directing groups (3, 1, 5):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The ratio of para to ortho product is primarily determined by steric hindrance; a bulkier substituent will sterically hinder the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n    *   **3 (Chlorobenzene):** The `-Cl` atom is relatively small. Nitration of chlorobenzene, for comparison, yields about 64-70% para product. Bromination is expected to yield a high percentage of the para isomer.\n    *   **1 (Toluene):** The `-CH3` group is bulkier than `-Cl`. In conventional bromination, the para-isomer is the major product, forming about 60-70% of the monobrominated mixture.\n    *   **5 (Ethylbenzene):** The `-C2H5` group is bulkier than `-CH3`. Increased steric bulk leads to greater hindrance at the ortho positions, thus favoring para substitution even more than in toluene. Data for bromination in trifluoroacetic acid shows ethylbenzene gives 83.2% para-isomer, while toluene gives 79.2% para-isomer.\n\n### Arranging the Substances\n\nBased on the analysis, we can establish the order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** As the strongest meta-director, it will have the lowest para-yield.\n2.  **Ethyl benzoate (2):** A meta-director with a very low para-yield.\n3.  **Benzoic acid (6):** Another meta-director with a very low para-yield, likely slightly higher than the ester due to less deactivation.\n4.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** An ortho-, para-director where the `-Cl` atom is sterically small, but electronic effects strongly favor para substitution, often leading to a high para yield, but less than the alkylbenzenes in some conditions.\n5.  **Toluene (1):** The methyl group's steric hindrance favors the para position. Standard bromination yields around 36.8% para product under certain conditions, though this can vary. However, relative to other substituents, it is well-established.\n6.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group, leading to the highest proportion of para-isomer among the ortho-, para-directors due to the most significant steric hindrance at the ortho positions.\n\nCombining these findings, the correct order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 (Nitrobenzene) < 2 (Ethyl benzoate) < 6 (Benzoic acid) < 3 (Chlorobenzene) < 1 (Toluene) < 5 (Ethylbenzene)**.\n\nThis sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
