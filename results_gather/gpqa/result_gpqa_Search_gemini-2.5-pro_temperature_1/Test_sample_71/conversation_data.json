    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n### **Reaction Analysis**\n\n*   **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is treated with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide (NaI). The reaction between a tetrabromide like 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI is known to generate a highly reactive diene intermediate. In this case, the intermediate is **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**. This reactive diene then undergoes a Diels-Alder reaction with the starting norbornadiene derivative, which acts as a dienophile. Since two equivalents of the dibromo compound are used, a tandem Diels-Alder reaction occurs, with one molecule of the generated diene adding to each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene. This forms a large, symmetric molecule, **Product 1**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. This is a standard method for the acid-catalyzed deprotection of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OC(CH₃)₃) at the C7 position is cleaved to form a secondary alcohol (-OH), yielding **Product 2**. This reaction preserves the overall symmetry of the molecule.\n\n*   **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    Product 2 is treated with sulfur trioxide pyridine complex (SO₃•pyridine) in DMSO. This set of reagents is used for the **Parikh-Doering oxidation**, a mild reaction that oxidizes primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively. The secondary alcohol at C7 of Product 2 is oxidized to a ketone (=O), forming **Product 3**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n    Product 3 is heated to 150°C. The core of Product 3 is a derivative of bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one. Such structures are known to undergo a retro-Diels-Alder reaction at elevated temperatures. This reaction is followed by a cheletropic extrusion of carbon monoxide (CO), which is a common fragmentation pathway for bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one, yielding benzene as a stable aromatic product.\n\n    The overall process for the core is:\n    Product 3 → 2x [Diene] + Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one\n    Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one → Benzene + CO\n\n    The \"final product 4\" in the question refers to the other organic molecule generated in this process, which is the diene used in the initial step: **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n\n### **Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure**: The molecule consists of a six-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at the C1-C2 and C3-C4 positions. At C5 and C6, there are exocyclic double bonds (=CH₂).\n*   **Symmetry**: The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 single bonds. Due to this symmetry, several hydrogen atoms are chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's identify the sets of equivalent protons:\n1.  The hydrogen atom on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen atom on C4.\n2.  The hydrogen atom on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen atom on C3.\n3.  The two exocyclic methylene (=CH₂) groups at C5 and C6 are equivalent. However, within a single methylene group, the two hydrogen atoms are not equivalent. One points \"inward\" towards the ring system, and the other points \"outward\". These are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The C₂ symmetry makes the two \"inward\" hydrogens equivalent to each other, and the two \"outward\" hydrogens equivalent to each other.\n\nThis gives us four distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n*   **Set 1**: The two hydrogens at positions C1 and C4.\n*   **Set 2**: The two hydrogens at positions C2 and C3.\n*   **Set 3**: The two \"inward\" hydrogens on the exocyclic methylenes.\n*   **Set 4**: The two \"outward\" hydrogens on the exocyclic methylenes.\n\nTherefore, there are **4** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
