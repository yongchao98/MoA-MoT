    "In an organic chemistry lab, the phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a colloquialism used to describe a failed or difficult separation. This situation arises most frequently during chromatography.\n\nChromatography, including Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) and column chromatography, is a fundamental technique used to separate components of a mixture based on their differing polarities. In these methods, a solvent (the mobile phase) moves over a solid adsorbent like silica (the stationary phase).\n\nCompounds with lower polarity are less attracted to the polar stationary phase and travel farther, while more polar compounds interact more strongly and move shorter distances. When two compounds have very similar polarities, they travel at nearly the same rate. On a TLC plate, this results in their spots overlapping or merging, literally appearing \"on top of each other.\" In column chromatography, this means they will exit the column at the same time (co-elute), making their separation and purification challenging.\n\nConsidering the options:\n*   **A) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a property of chiral molecules and is not a separation technique itself.\n*   **B) Similar boiling points:** This would be a problem for separation by distillation, but the phrase is not typically associated with that technique.\n*   **D) Non-covalent interactions:** While these interactions are the basis for how chromatography works, \"similar polarities\" is the direct property that causes the poor separation the chemist is describing.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is most likely referring to the difficulty in separating their compounds using chromatography because they share very similar polarities.\n\n<<<C>>>"
