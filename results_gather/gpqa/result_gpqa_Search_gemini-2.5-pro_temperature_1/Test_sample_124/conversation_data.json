    "The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, a standard model in quantum mechanics. The energy eigenvalues and the degeneracy of these energy levels are key characteristics of this system.\n\n### Energy of the Third Excited State\n\nThe energy eigenvalues ($E_n$) for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\nwhere:\n*   $n$ is the principal quantum number (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant.\n*   $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the oscillator.\n\nThe different energy states are defined as follows:\n*   **Ground State:** This corresponds to n = 0.\n    $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (3/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to n = 1.\n    $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (5/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to n = 2.\n    $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (7/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to n = 3.\n    $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is **(9/2)ħω**.\n\n### Degeneracy of the Third Excited State\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level is the number of distinct quantum states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) that share the same energy. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy ($g_n$) of the nth energy level is given by the formula:\n$g_n = (n + 1)(n + 2) / 2$.\n\nFor the third excited state, we have n = 3. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n$g_3 = (3 + 1)(3 + 2) / 2$\n$g_3 = (4)(5) / 2$\n$g_3 = 20 / 2$\n$g_3 = 10$\n\nThus, there are **10** linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state.\n\nThis degeneracy arises from the different combinations of the Cartesian quantum numbers ($n_x, n_y, n_z$) that sum to the principal quantum number $n$. For n = 3, the possible integer combinations are:\n*   (3, 0, 0) and its 2 permutations: 3 states\n*   (2, 1, 0) and its 5 permutations: 6 states\n*   (1, 1, 1): 1 state\n\nThe total number of states is 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω and its degeneracy is 10. Comparing this with the given options:\n*   A) (9/2) ħω, 3\n*   B) 11 π² ħ² / (2m r²), 10\n*   C) 11 π² ħ² / (2m r²), 3\n*   D) (9/2) ħω, 10\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
