    "The problem describes a classic quantum mechanical phenomenon known as Larmor precession. Here's a step-by-step breakdown to determine the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle has a spin of 1/2, and its magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the spin-up state with respect to the Z-axis. In quantum mechanics, this state is denoted as `|+z>`.\n\n2.  **Hamiltonian and Time Evolution**: The interaction between a magnetic moment `μ` and a magnetic field `B` is described by the Hamiltonian `H = -μ · B`. Given that the magnetic moment is `μ = γS` (where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator), the new Hamiltonian, after the field is switched to the +Y direction, becomes `H = -γB * Sy`. The state of the particle will then evolve over time according to the Schrödinger equation, governed by this new Hamiltonian.\n\n3.  **Larmor Precession**: When the magnetic field is suddenly changed, the spin of the particle does not instantly realign. Instead, the expectation value of the spin vector begins to precess around the direction of the new magnetic field (the Y-axis). The z-component of the magnetic moment is proportional to the z-component of the spin, `μz = γSz`. We are interested in the average, or expectation value, of this component, which is `<μz(t)>`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Oscillation**: The calculation of the expectation value `<μz(t)>` shows that it oscillates. The expectation value of the spin's z-component, `<Sz(t)>`, will vary as `cos(ωt)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency of the oscillation.\n\n5.  **The Oscillation Frequency**: This angular frequency of precession is known as the Larmor frequency, `ωL`. The formula for the Larmor frequency is directly proportional to the gyromagnetic ratio and the magnitude of the magnetic field. The frequency `ω` is given by the equation:\n\n    `ω = γB`\n\nTherefore, the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with a frequency of `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
