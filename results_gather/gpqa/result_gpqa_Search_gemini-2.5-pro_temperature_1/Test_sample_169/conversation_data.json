    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, ⟨S_y⟩, for an electron in the spin state (3i, 4), we follow these steps.\n\nFirst, the given spin state is represented by the vector:\n|ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]ᵗ\n\nThe spin operator for the y-direction, S_y, is given by:\nS_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant and σ_y is the Pauli matrix for spin-y:\nσ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nThe expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is calculated using the formula:\n⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩\n\n1.  **Calculate the normalization factor ⟨ψ|ψ⟩.**\n    The bra vector ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩, so ⟨ψ| = [-3i, 4].\n    ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = 9 + 16 = 25.\n\n2.  **Calculate the term ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩.**\n    First, we apply the S_y operator to the state vector |ψ⟩:\n    S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]ᵗ\n    S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4), (i)(3i) + (0)(4) ]ᵗ\n    S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]ᵗ\n\n    Next, we multiply this result by the bra vector ⟨ψ|:\n    ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]ᵗ\n    ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]\n    ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [12i² - 12]\n    Since i² = -1:\n    ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-12 - 12] = (ħ/2) * [-24] = -12ħ.\n\n3.  **Compute the final expectation value.**\n    Now, we divide the result from step 2 by the normalization factor from step 1.\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = -12ħ / 25\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is -12ħ/25.\n\n<<<C>>>"
