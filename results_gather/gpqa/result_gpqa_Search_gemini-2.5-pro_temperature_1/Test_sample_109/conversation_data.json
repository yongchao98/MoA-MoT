    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, two main criteria must be met for each star:\n\n1.  **Positional Visibility:** The star must be observable from both the Northern Hemisphere (Keck, Hawaii) and the Southern Hemisphere (Paranal, Chile).\n2.  **Brightness:** The star's apparent V magnitude must be within the detection limits of *both* instruments.\n\nThe specified magnitude limits are:\n*   **ESPRESSO:** Apparent V magnitude < 17\n*   **HIRES:** Apparent V magnitude < 16\n\nTherefore, for a star to be detectable by both, it must be visible from both locations and have an apparent V magnitude **brighter than 16**.\n\n### Analysis of Each Star\n\n**1. Positional Visibility Analysis**\n\nA star's visibility depends on its declination (DEC) and the latitude of the observatory.\n*   **Keck Observatory:** Located at a latitude of approximately +20° N, it can observe stars down to a southern declination of about -70°.\n*   **Paranal Observatory:** Located at a latitude of about -25° S, it can observe stars up to a northern declination of roughly +65°.\n\n*   **Star1 (DEC = -75°):** This declination is too far south to be visible from Keck's northern latitude. Therefore, Star1 is not observable by both.\n*   **Star2 (DEC = +55°):** This declination is visible from both Paranal and Keck.\n*   **Star3 (DEC = +48°):** This declination is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Star4 (DEC = -48°):** This declination is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Star5 (DEC = +60°):** This declination is visible from both observatories.\n\n**2. Apparent Magnitude (m_V) Analysis**\n\nFor each star visible from both locations, we must determine its apparent V magnitude and check if it is less than 16. The apparent magnitude (m_V) is calculated using the distance modulus formula, including a term for interstellar extinction (A_V) where applicable:\n\nm_V = M_V + 5 * log₁₀(d) - 5 + A_V\n\nWhere M_V is the absolute V magnitude, d is the distance in parsecs, and A_V is the extinction in the V band. Extinction is calculated as A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V).\n\n*   **Star2 (Visible from both):**\n    *   The apparent V magnitude is given directly as **16.5 mag**.\n    *   This is not brighter than 16, so it cannot be detected by HIRES.\n\n*   **Star3 (Visible from both):**\n    *   The apparent V magnitude is given as **15.5 mag**.\n    *   This is brighter than 16, meeting the condition for both HIRES and ESPRESSO.\n\n*   **Star4 (Visible from both):**\n    *   M_V = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag.\n    *   First, calculate the extinction: A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n    *   Next, calculate the apparent magnitude: m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log₁₀(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**.\n    *   This is not brighter than 16, so it cannot be detected by HIRES.\n\n*   **Star5 (Visible from both):**\n    *   M_V = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc, no extinction is mentioned.\n    *   Calculate the apparent magnitude: m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log₁₀(5) - 5 = 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = **14.995 mag**.\n    *   This is brighter than 16, meeting the condition for both HIRES and ESPRESSO.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, only Star3 and Star5 meet both the visibility and brightness requirements for detection by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n*   **Star3:** Visible from both locations and has an apparent magnitude of 15.5.\n*   **Star5:** Visible from both locations and has an apparent magnitude of approximately 15.0.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
