  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "By analyzing the provided DNA sequence, the reason for the failed protein expression becomes clear. Let's break down the sequence into codons, which are the three-nucleotide sets that the ribosome reads to assemble a protein.\n\nThe sequence begins:\n`5'-ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA...-3'`\n\n1.  **Start Codon**: The sequence starts with `ATG`, which correctly codes for the initial Methionine residue.\n2.  **HA Tag**: The next nine codons, `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`, code for the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA. This is the correct sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic tag you intended to add.\n3.  **The Problem**: Following the HA tag sequence is the codon `AAA`, which codes for the amino acid Lysine. The very next codon is `TGA`. In the standard genetic code, `TGA` (or UGA in mRNA) is one of the three stop codons, along with UAA and UAG. When the ribosome encounters this `TGA` codon, it terminates translation.\n\nTherefore, the ribosome starts translation, correctly synthesizes the HA tag and one additional lysine residue, and then immediately stops. This results in the production of a very short, non-functional peptide, not the full-length GADD45G fusion protein you were expecting. This premature termination of translation is the reason you are unable to detect the overexpressed protein.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   A is incorrect because the HA tag sequence itself is correct.\n*   C is incorrect because the primary issue isn't proteolysis; the full-length protein is never synthesized in the first place.\n*   D is incorrect because the codon in question is TGA, not UAA, and stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs, to terminate translation in all organisms, including hamsters and mice.\n\nThe direct cause is the presence of an inadvertent stop codon immediately following the tag sequence.\n\n<<<B>>>"
