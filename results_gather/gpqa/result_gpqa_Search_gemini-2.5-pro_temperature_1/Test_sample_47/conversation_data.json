    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\n    This reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. One of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom. This yields **2-bromocyclohexanone** as Product 1.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\n    When an α-halo ketone like 2-bromocyclohexanone is treated with a base such as sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the contraction of the six-membered ring into a five-membered ring, forming a carboxylic acid derivative. The product of this step, Product 2, is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\n    Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) in a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Pyridine is typically added to neutralize the HCl byproduct. This reaction forms **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride** as Product 3.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\n    Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce highly reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is reduced to **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**, which is the final product, Product 4.\n\n### Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must examine the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). Due to the puckered nature of the cyclopentane ring and the presence of the substituent, not all hydrogen atoms are equivalent.\n\nWe can categorize the hydrogen atoms as follows:\n1.  **The aldehyde hydrogen (CHO):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The hydrogen on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1):** This methine hydrogen is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The hydrogens on the carbons adjacent to C1 (C2 and C5):** These two carbons are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry. However, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons (a total of four) are diastereotopic. This means the hydrogen pointing in one direction relative to the ring is different from the hydrogen pointing in the other direction. This results in two distinct types of hydrogens at these positions. (2 types)\n4.  **The hydrogens on the carbons beta to C1 (C3 and C4):** Similar to the positions above, these two carbons are equivalent. The two hydrogens on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\nCounting these up: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (on C1) + 2 (on C2/C5) + 2 (on C3/C4) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>"
