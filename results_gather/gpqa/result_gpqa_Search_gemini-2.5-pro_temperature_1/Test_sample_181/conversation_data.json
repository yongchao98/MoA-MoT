    "The Mott-Gurney equation for space-charge-limited current (SCLC) is derived under several key assumptions. Analyzing these assumptions allows us to determine the correct statement regarding its validity.\n\n*   **Single-Carrier Device:** The model assumes that only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes, is mobile and contributes to the current.\n*   **Trap-Free:** The standard Mott-Gurney equation assumes the semiconductor is free of traps that can immobilize charge carriers. The presence of traps would modify the voltage dependence of the current.\n*   **Ohmic Contact (No Injection Barrier):** The derivation requires an \"Ohmic\" contact that can supply an unlimited number of charge carriers into the device. This means there is no energy barrier to charge injection, so the current is limited by the bulk properties of the material (the space charge) rather than the contact itself.\n*   **Negligible Diffusion Current:** A central assumption of the Mott-Gurney law is that the current is dominated by the drift of carriers in the electric field. The current arising from the diffusion of carriers due to concentration gradients is considered negligible. This is generally valid for devices that are not excessively thin and at sufficiently high voltages.\n\nWith these points in mind, we can evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because the model is specifically for a single-carrier device.\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement accurately reflects all the key ideal conditions: it is a single-carrier model, assumes no traps, requires a perfect injecting contact (no barrier), and assumes the current is drift-dominated (negligible diffusion).\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect. A Schottky contact typically has an injection barrier, which would limit the current in a way not described by the SCLC model. SCLC requires an Ohmic contact for unlimited charge injection.\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This is incorrect. The Mott-Gurney equation describes a drift-dominated current; neglecting the drift current would contradict the fundamental principle of the model.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that correctly describes the validity conditions for the Mott-Gurney equation is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
