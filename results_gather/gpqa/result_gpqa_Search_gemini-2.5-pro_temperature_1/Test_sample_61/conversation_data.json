    "To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, a multi-step process is required. The overall strategy involves converting the starting alkyne into an aldehyde, which then undergoes a self-condensation reaction.\n\n1.  **Formation of Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde:** The first major goal is to transform ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   **Step 1: Reduction to Alkene.** The triple bond of ethynylcyclohexane must be reduced to a double bond to form vinylcyclohexane. This is a partial reduction. Both dissolving metal reduction (using Lithium in liquid ammonia, Li/liq. NH3) and catalytic hydrogenation with a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar's catalyst (H2/Pd-CaCO3) can achieve this.\n    *   **Step 2: Oxidative Cleavage (Ozonolysis).** The resulting vinylcyclohexane can then be cleaved at the double bond to yield an aldehyde. This is accomplished through ozonolysis (using O3) followed by a reductive workup. A reductive workup, for instance with dimethyl sulfide ((CH3)2S), ensures that the reaction stops at the aldehyde stage and does not proceed to a carboxylic acid. This reaction splits vinylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and formaldehyde.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Final Product (Aldol Reaction):** The second phase is the dimerization of the newly formed cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   **Step 3: Aldol Reaction.** Two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde react in the presence of a base catalyst in what is known as an aldol reaction. One molecule forms an enolate which then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. The resulting product is the Î²-hydroxy aldehyde, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Suitable bases for this reaction include hydroxides like barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2) or ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH).\n\n### Evaluation of the Options:\n\n*   **A)** The first step, alkylation with methyl chloride, is incorrect as it would form 1-cyclohexyl-1-propyne, which would not lead to the desired product.\n*   **B)** This option is incorrect because the ozonolysis step uses an oxidative workup (H2O), which would produce a carboxylic acid instead of the required aldehyde.\n*   **C)** This sequence follows the correct chemical logic.\n    1.  **NaNH2, methanol:** This first step is chemically neutral; the strong base (NaNH2) deprotonates the alkyne, and the weak acid (methanol) immediately re-protonates it, resulting in no net change to the starting material. We can proceed with ethynylcyclohexane.\n    2.  **Li/liq. NH3:** This correctly reduces the alkyne to an alkene (vinylcyclohexane).\n    3.  **O3/ (CH3)2S:** This correctly performs a reductive ozonolysis to yield cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    4.  **NH4OH:** This provides the basic conditions needed for the aldol reaction to produce the final product.\n*   **D)** This option is incorrect because the second step (H2/Pd) would completely reduce the alkyne to an alkane (ethylcyclohexane), removing the functionality needed for subsequent steps.\n\nBased on this analysis, sequence C represents the only viable pathway to the target molecule among the choices provided.\n\n<<<C>>>"
