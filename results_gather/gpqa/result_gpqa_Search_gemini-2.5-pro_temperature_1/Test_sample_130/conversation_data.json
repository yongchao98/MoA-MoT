    "Here is a detailed analysis to determine which resonances are connected by the key cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and the Reaction\n\n1.  **The Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride—a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm—are characteristic of **maleic anhydride**. The two equivalent vinylic protons give the singlet at 7 ppm, while the two equivalent alkene carbons (~137 ppm) and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm) account for the ¹³C signals. The molecular formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n2.  **The Diene:** The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n3.  **The Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition. The molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄), confirming it is an addition reaction.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products\n\nThe Diels-Alder reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. Two stereoisomers, an *endo* and an *exo* product, are formed.\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** In Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to secondary orbital interactions. The *exo* product is the minor, thermodynamically more stable product. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Endo* Isomer**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Exo* Isomer**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Spatial Relationships for NOESY\n\nThe Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) arises between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak in a 2D NOESY spectrum connects the signals of two such protons. The question states that a cross-peak is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent or weak in the minor (*exo*) product. This means we must identify a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\nLet's visualize the two isomers:\n\n*   ***Endo* Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride part of the molecule is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C7 (CH₂) bridge. In this arrangement, the protons on the anhydride ring carbons (let's call them **H_anhydride**) are positioned underneath the bicyclic system, pointing toward the C2=C3 double bond. This brings them very close to the methyl groups attached to this double bond (the **vinylic methyl groups**).\n*   ***Exo* Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride part is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons point toward the C7 bridge and away from the vinylic methyl groups.\n\nTherefore, the key NOE that distinguishes the major (*endo*) product is the spatial interaction between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **vinylic methyl** protons.\n\n### Step 4: Assign the ¹H NMR Signals\n\nNow, let's predict the ¹H NMR signals for the product and match them to the options provided. The product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) has four main sets of protons:\n\n1.  **Vinylic Methyl Protons (6H):** Two equivalent methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. These typically resonate around 1.6–2.2 ppm. Option D's \"6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\" is a perfect match.\n2.  **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (6H):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons. These are more shielded and appear further upfield, typically around 1.0-1.3 ppm.\n3.  **Anhydride Protons (H_anhydride, 2H):** Two equivalent protons on the carbons where the anhydride is fused. These protons are alpha to two carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. A chemical shift in the range of 3-4 ppm is expected. Option D's \"2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\" is an excellent fit.\n4.  **Bridge Methylene Protons (2H):** The two protons of the C7 bridge.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Cross-Peak\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   The distinguishing NOE in the major (*endo*) product is between the **vinylic methyl protons** and the **anhydride protons (H_anhydride)**.\n*   The vinylic methyl protons correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   The anhydride protons correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This matches option D.\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Bridgehead Me) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Vinylic Me)\n*   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride)\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Bridgehead Me) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Vinylic Me) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride)**\n\nThe correct answer is D, as it identifies the two groups of protons (vinylic methyls and anhydride methines) that are uniquely close in the major *endo* adduct, and correctly assigns their expected integrals and chemical shifts.\n\n<<<D>>>"
