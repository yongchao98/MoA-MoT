    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatographic separations to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter at carbon C5 has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride can attack from either face of the carbonyl, leading to two possible stereoisomers. Since the starting material already possesses a stereocenter at C5 that is unaffected by the reaction, the two products formed will be diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomers are produced.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBHâ‚„) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups at C2 and C4 to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. This results in the formation of three stereoisomers:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This pair of molecules are non-superimposable mirror images, making them enantiomers. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) one.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are produced: a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five distinct stereoisomeric compounds:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\n**1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, like the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) pair from Reaction II, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, which have different physical properties, are separable.\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers and will produce **two separate peaks**.\n    *   In Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the racemic mixture will produce one peak, and the meso compound will produce a second, separate peak, for a total of **two peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** The two separable compounds from Reaction I and the two separable sets of compounds from Reaction II are all structurally different and will have unique retention times. Thus, the total number of peaks observed will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\nChiral HPLC is designed to separate enantiomers by using a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer. It can separate all stereoisomers.\n*   The five distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into five separate peaks.\n    *   **Reaction I:** The two diastereomers ((3S, 5S) and (3R, 5S)) will be separated, resulting in **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) from each other, and the achiral meso compound will elute as its own distinct peak. This results in **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** The total number of peaks will be the sum of the resolved stereoisomers from both reactions, which is 2 + 3 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to the option stating 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>"
