    "To solve this problem, we must first identify the transition that will occur when the molecule absorbs a photon. The molecule starts in its fundamental or ground state, which for the rotation-vibration model corresponds to a vibrational quantum number `v=0` and a rotational quantum number `J=0`. The energy of the absorbed photon must exactly match the energy difference between the initial and final states of the molecule.\n\nThe energy levels of a diatomic molecule in this model are given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\nE(v, J) = E_vib + E_rot = (v + 1/2)ħω + Bħ²J(J+1)\nwhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   ω is the angular frequency of vibration\n*   `B` is the rotational constant, which depends on the molecule's moment of inertia.\n\nFor a photon to be absorbed, the transition must obey certain selection rules. For rovibrational transitions in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the selection rules are Δv = ±1 and ΔJ = ±1. Since the molecule starts at `v=0` and `J=0` and absorbs energy, the final state must have `v'=1` and `J'=1`. A transition to `J'=-1` is not possible. Therefore, the specific transition is from the (v=0, J=0) state to the (v=1, J=1) state.\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (ΔE) is the difference between the final and initial energy levels:\n*   E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω\n*   E_final = E(1, 1) = (3/2)ħω + Bħ²(1)(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2Bħ²\n*   ΔE = E_final - E_initial = ħω + 2Bħ²\n\nThis energy change consists of a vibrational part (ħω) and a rotational part (2Bħ²). We need to calculate both.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Vibrational Energy Change (ΔE_vib):**\n    *   ΔE_vib = ħω\n    *   ΔE_vib = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n2.  **Calculate the Rotational Energy Change (ΔE_rot):**\n    *   This requires the rotational constant B, which is derived from the moment of inertia `I`.\n    *   First, calculate the reduced mass (μ) of the molecule:\n        *   μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n        *   μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n        *   Converting to kg: μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu) ≈ 3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg.\n    *   Next, calculate the moment of inertia (I):\n        *   I = μR²\n        *   I ≈ (3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.207 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n    *   The rotational energy term is 2Bħ² = ħ²/I:\n        *   ΔE_rot = ħ²/I = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.207 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.20 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Energy Change (ΔE):**\n    *   ΔE = ΔE_vib + ΔE_rot = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.0092 x 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n    *   Note that the rotational energy is a very small correction to the vibrational energy.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p):**\n    *   The energy and momentum of a photon are related by the equation E = pc, where c is the speed of light (≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s).\n    *   p = ΔE / c\n    *   p ≈ (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s\nB) p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s\nC) p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s\nD) p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s\n\nThe calculated momentum of approximately 1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s is a very close match to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
