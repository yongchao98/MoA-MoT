    "An N-sided polygon where N approaches infinity, while maintaining a constant apothem 'a', takes the shape of a circle with a radius equal to the apothem 'a'. The problem, therefore, simplifies to finding the angular distance between the first two minima of a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThis diffraction pattern is known as the Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central region (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nThe condition for the minima is given by the relation:\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = z / (ka)\n\nWhere:\n*   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   k is the wave number, k = 2π/λ.\n*   'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   'z' represents the zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nThe first two non-zero roots (zeros) of the Bessel function J₁(x) are approximately:\n*   z₁ ≈ 3.8317 (for the first minimum)\n*   z₂ ≈ 7.0156 (for the second minimum)\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first two minima:\n\nFor the first minimum (θ₁):\nθ₁ = z₁ * λ / (2πa) = 3.8317 * λ / (2πa) ≈ 0.610 λ / a\n\nThis value corresponds to the angular radius of the Airy disk.\n\nFor the second minimum (θ₂):\nθ₂ = z₂ * λ / (2πa) = 7.0156 * λ / (2πa) ≈ 1.116 λ / a\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between these two minima, which is the difference between their angular positions:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ = (1.116 λ / a) - (0.610 λ / a)\nΔθ = (1.116 - 0.610) * λ / a\nΔθ = 0.506 λ / a\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
