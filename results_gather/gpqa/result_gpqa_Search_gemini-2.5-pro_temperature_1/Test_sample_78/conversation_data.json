    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound X:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Product's NMR Spectra\n\nFirst, we must deduce the structure of the reaction product from the provided ¹H-NMR and ¹³C-NMR data.\n\n**¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n*   **δ 2.28 (3H, s):** A singlet integrating to three protons suggests a methyl group (CH₃) with no adjacent protons.\n*   **δ 2.31 (3H, s):** Another singlet for three protons, indicating a second methyl group, also without adjacent protons.\n*   **δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d):** These two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n*   **δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d):** These two doublets, each for one proton, are typical for two protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-) that are coupled only to each other.\n\n**¹³C-NMR Analysis:**\n*   **δ 197.7 (1C, s):** This signal at a very high chemical shift is indicative of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), specifically within a conjugated ketone.\n*   **δ 126.9 (2C, s) and δ 129.1 (2C, s):** These signals, each representing two carbons, correspond to the CH carbons of the para-substituted aromatic ring.\n*   **δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s):** These are the signals for the two methyl group carbons.\n*   The remaining signals (δ 127.1, 130.3, 141.5, 144.1) belong to the vinylic carbons and the quaternary aromatic carbons.\n\n**Assembling the Product Structure:**\nBased on the spectral data, the product is an α,β-unsaturated methyl ketone with a para-substituted tolyl group. The structure is **(E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\nLet's verify the NMR assignments for this structure:\n*   **¹H-NMR:** The methyl group on the aromatic ring (p-tolyl) corresponds to one of the singlets (~2.3 ppm), and the methyl group of the acetyl function (-COCH₃) corresponds to the other (~2.3 ppm). The two doublets at ~7.1 and ~7.7 ppm represent the aromatic protons. The two vinyl protons (-CH=CH-) appear as doublets at ~6.75 and ~7.68 ppm. This matches the data perfectly.\n*   **¹³C-NMR:** The ketone carbonyl appears at ~198 ppm. The two methyl carbons are found at ~21 and ~28 ppm. The aromatic and vinylic carbons account for the remaining signals. The molecular formula of this product is C₁₁H₁₂O, which matches that of the starting material, Compound X.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction\n\nCompound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) is treated with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K (130 °C). This reaction converts Compound X into (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n*   DABCO is a non-nucleophilic base.\n*   The reaction is an isomerization, as the starting material and product have the same molecular formula.\n*   The options provided for Compound X are all epoxides (oxiranes).\n*   The conversion of an epoxide to a ketone is a well-known process called the Meinwald rearrangement. Research shows that DABCO is an effective catalyst for the Meinwald rearrangement of terminal 2-aryl- and 2-alkenyl-epoxides, specifically converting them into methyl ketones. The reaction conditions given in the problem are consistent with those reported in the literature for this transformation.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Options for Compound X\n\nThe reaction is the isomerization of an epoxide (Compound X) to (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. We need to find which of the given epoxides would yield this specific product.\n\n*   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This is an internal epoxide with a phenyl group. Its rearrangement would not produce a p-tolyl group, and the resulting ketone would have a different carbon skeleton.\n*   **B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound contains a phenyl group, not the required p-tolyl group. Furthermore, its rearrangement would lead to a different ketone, likely 2-methyl-1-phenylbut-1-en-3-one.\n*   **C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The structure is p-tolyl-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂. This is a terminal epoxide with a 4-methylstyryl group. The DABCO-catalyzed Meinwald rearrangement of terminal epoxides of the type R-CH(O)CH₂ yields methyl ketones with the structure R-C(=O)CH₃. In this case, R is the p-tolyl-CH=CH- group. The predicted product is therefore p-tolyl-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃, which is (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. This perfectly matches the product identified from the NMR data.\n*   **D) 2-styrylepoxide:** The molecular formula for 2-styryloxirane (C₁₀H₁₀O) does not match the given formula for Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the product's NMR spectra and the known reactivity of epoxides with DABCO, Compound X is identified as 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, which rearranges to form (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n<<<C>>>"
