    "The final product of the multi-step reaction is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. This is determined by analyzing each step of the synthesis.\n\n*   **Step 1: Nitration of Benzene**\n    Benzene reacts with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The nitronium ion (NO₂⁺) is generated and substitutes a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring to form **nitrobenzene (Product 1)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Bromination of Nitrobenzene**\n    Nitrobenzene (Product 1) is treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron powder (Fe), which acts as a catalyst. The nitro group (-NO₂) is a deactivating group and a meta-director. Therefore, the incoming bromine atom is directed to the meta position (carbon-3) of the benzene ring. This reaction yields **1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene (Product 2)**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Reduction of the Nitro Group**\n    1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene (Product 2) is stirred with a palladium-on-carbon catalyst (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere. This is a standard catalytic hydrogenation method used to reduce a nitro group to an amino group (-NH₂). The bromo group is generally unaffected by these conditions, resulting in the formation of **3-bromoaniline (Product 3)**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Diazotization**\n    3-bromoaniline (Product 3) is treated with sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) and tetrafluoroboric acid (HBF₄). This is a diazotization reaction that converts the primary aromatic amine group (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt. The resulting product is **3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate (Product 4)**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Gomberg-Bachmann Arylation**\n    The diazonium salt (Product 4) is heated and treated with anisole (methoxybenzene). This reaction is a Gomberg-Bachmann reaction, which is an aryl-aryl coupling that proceeds via a radical mechanism. The 3-bromobenzenediazonium salt forms a 3-bromophenyl radical. This radical then attacks the anisole ring. The methoxy group (-OCH₃) on anisole is an ortho, para-director, meaning it directs incoming substituents to the positions ortho or para to it. Due to steric hindrance, the para-position is favored. The 3-bromophenyl group attaches to the position para to the methoxy group on the anisole ring. This coupling results in the final product, **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl (Product 5)**.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
