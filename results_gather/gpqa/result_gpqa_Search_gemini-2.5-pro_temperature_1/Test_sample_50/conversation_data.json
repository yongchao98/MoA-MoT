    "The initial theoretical derivation of the potential energy `U` for a charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` yielded the formula:\n\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis was derived using two methods:\n1.  **Work Calculation:** Calculating the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` by integrating the force between the charge `q` and its image charge `q'`. The force on the real charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is due to the image charge `q' = -qR/x` located at `b = R^2/x`. The force is `F(x) = k*q*q' / (x-b)^2`, and the potential energy is the integral of this force from infinity to `d`.\n2.  **Interaction Energy:** Using the formula for the interaction energy between a charge and an induced charge distribution on a conductor, which is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. The potential at the location of `q` due to the induced charge (`V_induced`) is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\nBoth derivations led to the same result. The Google search results confirm the methodology used, particularly the \"method of images\" for a point charge and a grounded conducting sphere. This method involves placing an image charge `q' = -q(R/d)` at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center of the sphere. The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at `d`.\n\nThe calculated force of attraction between the real charge `q` and its image `q'` is `F = -k * q^2 * R * d / (d^2 - R^2)^2`. Integrating this force from infinity to `d` gives the potential energy. This confirms the steps taken in the initial derivation.\n\nThe final derived formula is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. Let's compare this with the given options:\nA) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n\nThe derived formula exactly matches option C. The presence of the `1/2` factor is crucial and comes from the fact that the induced charge distribution (and thus the image charge) is created by the real charge itself. The potential energy is the work done to assemble the system, and simply multiplying the charge `q` by the potential from the image charge would result in double-counting the energy.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for the net potential energy of the system is given by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
