    "Here is a step-by-step determination of the pH of the final solution.\n\n### 1. Calculate the Initial Moles of Each Substance\n\nFirst, we determine the number of moles for each of the reactants before any reaction occurs.\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH₃COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M (mol/L)\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M (mol/L)\n    *   Moles = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂), a strong base:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M (mol/L)\n    *   Moles = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n\n### 2. Determine the Moles of Acidic (H⁺) and Basic (OH⁻) Ions\n\nNext, we identify the total moles of acidic protons and hydroxide ions that will react.\n\n*   **Total moles of H⁺:**\n    *   From the strong acid HCl: 0.080 mol (since HCl dissociates completely).\n    *   From the weak acid CH₃COOH: We will use its total moles for the neutralization reaction, which is 0.050 mol.\n\n*   **Total moles of OH⁻:**\n    *   From the strong base Ba(OH)₂: Ba(OH)₂ dissociates to provide two OH⁻ ions for every one unit.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)₂ × 2 = 0.180 mol\n\n### 3. Perform the Neutralization Reactions\n\nThe neutralization reactions will occur in steps, with the strong acid and strong base reacting first.\n\n*   **Step 1: Strong Acid + Strong Base**\n    *   The 0.080 moles of H⁺ from HCl will react with the OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Step 2: Remaining Strong Base + Weak Acid**\n    *   The remaining 0.100 moles of OH⁻ will react with the 0.050 moles of the weak acid, CH₃COOH.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\nAfter all reactions are complete, there are 0.050 moles of excess hydroxide ions (OH⁻) in the solution.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Final pH\n\nThe final pH is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻).\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the final pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
