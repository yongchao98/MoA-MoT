    "To identify the unknown compound, we will systematically analyze the data from each characterisation technique.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The combination of this peak with the broad O-H stretch is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the spectrum confirms that the compound is an alkene. These peaks typically appear in the 4.5-7.0 ppm region of the NMR spectrum.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment ion for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ group (12 for Carbon + 16+16 for Oxygen + 1 for Hydrogen = 45).\n\n### Integration of Data and Structure Determination:\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points conclusively to a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n*   The presence of the carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options B (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O).\n*   We are left with two possibilities: **A) C6H10O2** and **D) C6H12O2**.\n\nTo distinguish between these two, we calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or π (pi) bonds in a molecule. The formula for a compound with the formula CxHyO₂ is:\n\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\nOur spectroscopic data revealed two sources of unsaturation:\n1.  One C=O double bond (in the carboxylic acid group).\n2.  One C=C double bond (in the alkene group).\n\nThis means the molecule must have a total of **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n\nNow, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**\n*   **D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**\n\nThe formula C6H10O2 has a degree of unsaturation of 2, which perfectly matches our findings of one C=O bond and one C=C bond. The formula C6H12O2 only has one degree of unsaturation, which would account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond but not the additional C=C double bond.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound must be C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
