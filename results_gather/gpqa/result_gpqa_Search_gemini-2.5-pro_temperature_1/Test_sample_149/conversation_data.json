    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Starting Material**\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO from its 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** 5 (suggesting a benzene ring and one other double bond, likely a carbonyl group).\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift and multiplicity (triplet) are characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde's single proton, hence it appears as a doublet. This confirms the presence of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region are a classic sign of a para-disubstituted (1,4-substituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2).\n\nAssembling these fragments, we have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO) as substituents. The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This structure matches the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** These reagents are used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The intermediate formed is 4-(diazonium chloride)phenylacetaldehyde.\n2.  **H₂O:** Water is added to hydrolyze the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction, sometimes called the Sandmeyer reaction (though technically just hydrolysis), forms **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** The product from step 2, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is treated with aqueous potassium hydroxide (a strong base) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the α-carbon (the CH₂ group) of one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This initially forms an aldol addition product, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option B).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct. This dehydration is highly favorable as it results in a conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which is more stable. The final product of this condensation is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This specific compound has been synthesized and studied for its biological activities.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product**\n\nThe question asks for the final product after all reaction steps, including heating. The heat drives the reaction to completion, favoring the formation of the more stable, dehydrated condensation product over the simple addition product.\n\n*   **Option A** is incorrect because the hydroxyl groups are missing and the double bond is in the wrong position.\n*   **Option B** is the intermediate aldol addition product, which would be isolated under milder conditions without heat.\n*   **Option C** is the final aldol condensation product, resulting from dehydration of the adduct, which is expected under heating.\n*   **Option D** is an incorrect structure that would not be formed from this reaction.\n\nTherefore, the final product is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed via aldol condensation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
