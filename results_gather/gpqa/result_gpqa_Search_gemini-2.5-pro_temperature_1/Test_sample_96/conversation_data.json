    "The less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome (47,XXY) compared to Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21) are due to a dosage compensation mechanism known as X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). This process is not available for autosomal trisomies like Down's syndrome.\n\nIn individuals with more than one X chromosome, including those with Klinefelter's syndrome, one of the X chromosomes is largely silenced early in embryonic development (post-zygote). This inactivation is an epigenetic process that involves modifying chromatin to make it compact and transcriptionally inactive. Key to this process is the methylation of histones by enzymes like histone methyltransferases, which leads to the formation of a structure called a Barr body. This ensures that the dosage of most X-linked genes is balanced between males (XY) and females (XX), and it also mitigates the effect of an extra X chromosome in XXY individuals.\n\nHowever, not all genes on the inactivated X chromosome are silenced; about 15% of genes \"escape\" inactivation, which contributes to the specific features of Klinefelter's syndrome.\n\nIn contrast, Down's syndrome results from an extra copy of an autosome, chromosome 21. There is no comparable mechanism to inactivate an entire extra autosome. Consequently, individuals with Down's syndrome have a 1.5-fold overexpression of many genes on chromosome 21, leading to a more significant gene dosage imbalance and more severe, widespread phenotypic effects.\n\nBased on this mechanism, the correct option is B because chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases is the core molecular process behind X-chromosome inactivation, which occurs after fertilization (post-zygote).\n\n<<<B>>>"
