    "The reaction between an organocuprate, like lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), and an epoxide is a well-established method in organic synthesis for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The outcome of this reaction is governed by specific rules of regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n1.  **Reactants**: The reaction involves (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane and lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi). The bicyclic compound is a substituted cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons 1 and 6. The nucleophile provided by the cuprate is a methyl group (CH₃⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: The first rule provided states that the incoming alkyl group (the nucleophile) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide is formed between carbon C1 and carbon C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon bonded to a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is also a tertiary carbon, but it is bonded to a hydrogen atom, not a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered position, and the nucleophilic methyl group from Me2CuLi will attack C6. This determines the connectivity of the resulting product, eliminating options that would arise from an attack at C1. The attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring, leaving the oxygen attached to C1, which becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after an aqueous workup.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The second rule states that an inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon atom that is attacked. This is characteristic of an Sₙ2-type reaction.\n    *   The nucleophilic attack occurs at C6.\n    *   The initial stereochemical configuration of C6 is given as (S).\n    *   Due to the Sₙ2 mechanism, the configuration at C6 will be inverted to (R).\n    *   The configurations of the other stereocenters in the molecule (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps and thus retain their original configurations.\n\n**Determining the Product Structure and Name**\n\n*   **Initial Stereochemistry**:\n    *   C1: R\n    *   C3: R\n    *   C4: R\n    *   C6: S\n*   **Reaction Outcome**:\n    *   Attack occurs at C6.\n    *   The ring opens, and the C1-O bond becomes a C1-OH group. The stereocenter at C1 remains (R).\n    *   A new methyl group attaches to C6, and its stereocenter inverts from (S) to (R).\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 remain (R).\n*   **Product Naming (IUPAC)**: The product is a substituted cyclohexanol. According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group is designated as C1. To assign the lowest possible locants to the substituents, the ring is numbered towards the newly methylated carbon (the original C6).\n    *   **New C1** corresponds to the **Old C1**. It has an -OH group and a methyl group. Its configuration remains **(R)**.\n    *   **New C2** corresponds to the **Old C6**. It now has a methyl group. Its configuration has inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n    *   **New C4** corresponds to the **Old C4**. It has a methyl group. Its configuration remains **(R)**.\n    *   **New C5** corresponds to the **Old C3**. It has a methyl group. Its configuration remains **(R)**.\n\nCombining these assignments, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
