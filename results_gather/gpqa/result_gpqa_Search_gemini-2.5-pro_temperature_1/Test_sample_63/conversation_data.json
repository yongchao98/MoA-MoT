    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer based on the problem statement and chemical principles.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases is formed upon heating the salts and is then passed through a series of tubes. We can determine the composition of the gas mixture by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a strong drying agent, used to absorb water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of 3.60 g is equal to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂), which would form a precipitate (CaCO₃).\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change, indicating the absence of CO₂ or other acidic gases (like SO₂ or most nitrogen oxides).\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper**\n    *   Hot copper can react with oxygen or oxygen-containing compounds like nitrous oxide (N₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form copper oxide (CuO).\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas (Gas C) remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, an alkali solution, or hot copper. This strongly suggests the gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Identifying the Gaseous Products of Decomposition\n\nFrom the analysis above, we need to identify the initial gases produced by heating the salts. The gases contained 0.20 mol of H₂O, 0.10 mol of N₂, and a gas that supplied 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms to the hot copper.\n\nThe gas that reacted with copper was likely nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is:\nN₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO\n\nThis reaction explains the observations perfectly:\n*   It provides the 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms that caused the 0.80 g mass increase in tube №3.\n*   For this to happen, 0.05 mol of N₂O must have been present in the initial gas mixture.\n*   This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂ gas.\n\nThe total amount of N₂ gas (Gas C) collected at the end was 0.10 mol. Since 0.05 mol of this N₂ came from the decomposition of N₂O in tube №3, the other 0.05 mol of N₂ must have been present in the original gas mixture from the start.\n\nTherefore, the thermal decomposition of salts A and B produced:\n*   **0.20 mol of H₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol of N₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol of N₂**\n\n### 3. Identifying Salts A and B\n\nThe salts decomposed completely into a mixture of H₂O, N₂O, and N₂. This composition points towards ammonium salts containing nitrogen and oxygen. The two most common salts that produce these gases upon heating are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nThe decomposition reactions are:\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was **equimolar**. Let's assume *n* moles of salt A and *n* moles of salt B were heated.\n*   From *n* moles of NH₄NO₃, we get *n* moles of N₂O and 2*n* moles of H₂O.\n*   From *n* moles of NH₄NO₂, we get *n* moles of N₂ and 2*n* moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal products would be:\n*   Moles of N₂O = *n*\n*   Moles of N₂ = *n*\n*   Moles of H₂O = 2*n* + 2*n* = 4*n*\n\nComparing this with our findings from the gas analysis:\n*   Moles of N₂O = *n* = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of N₂ = *n* = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of H₂O = 4*n* = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol\n\nThe results are perfectly consistent, confirming that the mixture contained 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₂.\n\n### 4. Verifying the Initial Mass\n\nLet's check if the mass of this mixture matches the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 1.01) + (3 × 16.00) = 80.06 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 1.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 64.06 g/mol\n\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol × 80.06 g/mol = 4.003 g\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol × 64.06 g/mol = 3.203 g\n*   Total Mass = 4.003 g + 3.203 g = 7.206 g\n\nThis matches the initial weight of 7.20 g.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in one molecule of each.\nTotal atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
