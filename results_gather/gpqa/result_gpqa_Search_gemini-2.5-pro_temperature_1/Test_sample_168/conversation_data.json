    "This question describes a nuclear decay analogous to double beta decay. Let's break down the two scenarios to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Scenario 1: The Original Decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V)\n\nThis process is analogous to the observed two-neutrino double beta decay (`2n → 2p + 2e⁻ + 2ν̅e`). Here, two heavy particles (A, nucleons) convert into two other heavy particles (B, nucleons), emitting two light particles (E, electrons) and two other light particles (V, antineutrinos).\n\n*   **Energy Spectrum:** In any decay with more than two particles in the final state, the available energy (the Q-value) is shared among them. Because the two 'V' particles can carry away a variable amount of energy (from zero up to the maximum possible), the two 'E' particles are left with a continuous spectrum of total kinetic energy. This is consistent with the problem statement.\n*   **Endpoint (Q):** The endpoint of the spectrum for the total energy of the two 'E' particles corresponds to the maximum possible energy they can have. This occurs when the other emitted particles (the two 'V' particles) carry away minimal (essentially zero) kinetic energy. The problem defines this endpoint value as Q.\n\n### Scenario 2: The Variant Decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + M)\n\nThis variant decay is analogous to Majoron-emitting neutrinoless double beta decay. Here, the two 'V' particles are replaced by a single, exotic, *massless* particle M.\n\n1.  **Continuous vs. Discrete Spectrum:** The final state consists of three \"particles\" (the 2B nucleus, the 2E particles, and the M particle). Since this is still a multi-body final state (more than two), the energy must be shared among the products. The massless particle M can carry away a continuous range of energy, just as the two V particles did. Consequently, the total energy of the two E particles will also have a continuous distribution. This eliminates options C and D, which suggest a discrete spectrum.\n\n2.  **Endpoint Comparison:** The total energy released in the decay is determined by the mass difference between the initial and final states.\n    *   **Decay 1 Energy:** Q-value₁ = [Mass(2A) - Mass(2B) - Mass(2E) - Mass(2V)]c². The endpoint of the E-particle spectrum is Q, which is the maximum kinetic energy available to the E particles. This happens when the kinetic energy of the V particles is zero. However, energy is also required to create the *rest mass* of the two V particles. So, Q = Q-value₁ - 2mᵥc².\n    *   **Decay 2 Energy:** Q-value₂ = [Mass(2A) - Mass(2B) - Mass(2E) - Mass(M)]c². The problem states that particle M is massless (mₘ = 0).\n\n    In the standard model of physics, neutrinos (the 'V' particles) are known to have a small but non-zero rest mass. In the variant decay, the massless particle M replaces them. Because energy is no longer needed to create the rest mass of the two V particles, more energy is available to be distributed as kinetic energy among the final products.\n\n    The endpoint of the E-particle spectrum in the second scenario will be higher than in the first scenario by the amount of energy that is no longer needed for the rest mass of the two V particles. The new endpoint Q' will be equal to Q + 2mᵥc². Therefore, the endpoint increases.\n\n3.  **Shape of the Spectrum:** The distribution of energy (the shape of the spectrum) depends on the number of particles in the final state. Moving from a four-body final state (2B, 2E, 2V) to a three-body final state (2B, 2E, M) changes the phase space of the decay. The spectrum for the Majoron-emitting decay is known to be \"harder,\" meaning it is shifted towards higher energies compared to the two-neutrino decay.\n\nCombining these points:\n*   The spectrum remains **continuous**.\n*   The shape is **adjusted** (shifted towards higher energy).\n*   The endpoint **increases** because energy is no longer consumed to create the mass of the two V particles.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
