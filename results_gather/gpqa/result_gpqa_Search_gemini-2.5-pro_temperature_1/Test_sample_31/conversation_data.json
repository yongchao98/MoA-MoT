    "To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for the given conditions, we must first calculate the total relativistic energy of the specified nucleus.\n\n### 1. Identify the Nucleus and its Composition\nThe nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   Lithium has an atomic number (Z) of 3, which means it has 3 protons.\n*   The problem states it has 3 neutrons (N).\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li), composed of 3 protons and 3 neutrons.\n\n### 2. Determine the Rest Mass (m₀) of the Nucleus\nFor this calculation, we will sum the rest masses of the constituent protons and neutrons. This is a common method in such problems, which often disregards the mass defect due to nuclear binding energy.\n*   The rest mass of a proton is approximately 0.9383 GeV/c².\n*   The rest mass of a neutron is approximately 0.9396 GeV/c².\n\nThe total rest mass of the ⁶Li nucleus is:\nm₀ = (3 × mass of a proton) + (3 × mass of a neutron)\nm₀ = 3 × (0.9383 GeV/c² + 0.9396 GeV/c²)\nm₀ = 3 × (1.8779 GeV/c²)\nm₀ = 5.6337 GeV/c²\n\n### 3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe speed of the nucleus is given as v = 0.96c. The Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\nγ = 1 / √(0.0784)\nγ = 1 / 0.28\nγ ≈ 3.5714\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)\nThe total relativistic energy is given by Einstein's equation E = γm₀c².\n*   E = 3.5714 × (5.6337 GeV/c²) × c²\n*   E ≈ 20.120 GeV\n\n### 5. Compare with the Given Options\nThe calculated energy is approximately 20.120 GeV. Comparing this with the options provided:\nA) 18.475 GeV\nB) 20.132 GeV\nC) 21.419 GeV\nD) 23.069 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of 20.120 GeV is closest to option B, 20.132 GeV. The minor difference can be attributed to the precision of the physical constants used for the proton and neutron masses.\n\n<<<B>>>"
