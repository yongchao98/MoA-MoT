    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peaks:** The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion (M+) peak at m/z = 156 and another peak (M+2) at m/z = 158.\n*   **Isotopic Abundance:** The ratio of the intensities of these peaks is 100% to 32% (approximately 3:1). This M+ and M+2 pattern is a distinct signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule, corresponding to its two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl (75.8% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (24.2% abundance).\n*   **Molecular Weight:** The molecular weight of the compound containing the ³⁵Cl isotope is 156 g/mol.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n### 3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is highly indicative of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its integration as one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (due to rapid chemical exchange and no adjacent protons to couple with) confirm this assignment.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic indication of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two equivalent sets. The downfield doublet at 8.02 ppm corresponds to the two protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the slightly more upfield doublet at 7.72 ppm corresponds to the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom. Published spectral data for 4-chlorobenzoic acid show similar chemical shifts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the combined evidence:\n\n1.  **Mass Spec** confirms a molecular formula containing one chlorine atom with a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope).\n2.  **IR** confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n3.  **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid proton and indicates a *para*-substituted aromatic ring.\n\nEvaluating the given options:\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Inconsistent with the IR (not a carboxylic acid) and the NMR splitting pattern.\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it is a chlorobenzoic acid, the *ortho* substitution would produce a more complex splitting pattern for the four aromatic protons in the NMR, not two doublets of 2H each.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** The structure perfectly matches all spectral data. Its molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight with ³⁵Cl is (7*12)+(5*1)+35.5+(2*16) = 156.5 g/mol. It is a carboxylic acid, consistent with the IR spectrum. It has a *para*-substituted ring, which would give the observed 2H doublet + 2H doublet pattern in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** Inconsistent with the IR (no broad O-H) and NMR (no acidic proton, different aromatic pattern).\n\nThe spectral information strongly and consistently points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown white solid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
