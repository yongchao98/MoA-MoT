    "The search results confirm the physics I used. Specifically, they reiterate the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K), the orbital period (P), the stellar mass (M_star), the planet mass (M_p), and the orbital inclination (i).\n\nThe formula I used is consistent with the information in the search results:\nK ∝ (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))\n\nThe steps I followed were:\n1.  **Relate wavelength shift to RV semi-amplitude (K):** The Doppler shift is Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c. Therefore, the maximum wavelength shift (the observable) is directly proportional to the RV semi-amplitude K.\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7.\n\n2.  **Use the formula for K:**\n    K = ( (2πG)^(1/3) * m_p * sin(i) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )\n\n3.  **Analyze the ratio K₁ / K₂:**\n    K₁ / K₂ = [ (m_p1 * sin(i₁)) / (M_star1^(2/3) * P₁^(1/3)) ] / [ (m_p2 * sin(i₂)) / (M_star2^(2/3) * P₂^(1/3)) ]\n\n4.  **Apply the given conditions:**\n    *   M_star1 = M_star2 (same star masses)\n    *   m_p1 ≈ m_p2 (similar planet masses)\n    *   Assume sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂) as is standard when no information is provided.\n\n5.  **Simplify the ratio:** With these assumptions, the mass and inclination terms cancel out, leaving:\n    K₁ / K₂ = P₂^(1/3) / P₁^(1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n6.  **Solve for the period ratio (P₂ / P₁):**\n    *   5 / 7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and the underlying physics is sound and confirmed by the search results. The key is to correctly identify the relationship K ∝ P^(-1/3) under the given conditions. The result robustly points to option C.\n\nFinal check of the question: \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\" This asks for the ratio P₂ / P₁. My result is P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.36.\n\nThe logic is confirmed. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nThe periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity (K), so K ∝ Δλ.\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the orbital period (P), star mass (Mₛ), and planet mass (mₚ) by the formula:\nK ∝ (mₚ sin i) / (Mₛ²/³ * P¹/³)\nwhere *i* is the orbital inclination.\n\nWe are given:\n*   Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂ (stars have the same mass)\n*   mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂ (planets have similar masses)\n*   Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n*   Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n\nSince no information is given about the orbital inclinations, we assume they are similar (sin i₁ ≈ sin i₂). This is a standard assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise.\n\nUnder these conditions, the terms for planet mass, star mass, and inclination are approximately the same for both systems. The relationship simplifies to:\nK ∝ 1 / P¹/³\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two systems is:\nK₂ / K₁ = (P₂/P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁/P₂)^(1/3)\n\nSince K is proportional to Δλ:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\nNow, we set the two expressions for the ratio K₂ / K₁ equal to each other:\n(P₁/P₂)^(1/3) = 1.4\n\nTo find the required ratio P₂/P₁, we first solve for P₁/P₂:\nP₁/P₂ = (1.4)³ = 1.4 * 1.4 * 1.4 = 2.744\n\nFinally, we find the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1:\nP₂/P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<C>>>"
