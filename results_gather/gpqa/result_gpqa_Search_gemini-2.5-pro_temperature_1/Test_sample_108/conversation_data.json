    "To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must check each option against the established conservation laws and the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nHere is a summary of the initial state and the rules for a permitted transition:\n\n**Initial State: `1S0` NN system**\n*   Total Spin `S_i = 0`\n*   Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0`\n*   Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0`\n*   Parity `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`\n\n**Conservation Laws for the decay `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`**\n1.  **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`). For the final total angular momentum to be zero, it is required that `J_f = l_X`.\n2.  **Parity Conservation**: The initial parity is `P_i = +1`. The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity (`P_f(NN) = (-1)^L_f`), the intrinsic parity of particle X (`P(X) = -1`), and the parity of X's orbital motion (`(-1)^l_X`). For parity to be conserved, `P_i = P_f(NN) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`. This leads to `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`, which simplifies to the condition that the sum `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n**Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n*   The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   We are given that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n*   Substituting `T=0` into the rule gives `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This requires the sum `S_f + L_f` to be **odd**.\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on these three conditions:\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n*   **Angular Momentum (`J_f = l_X`?):** `1 = 1`. **OK**.\n*   **Parity (`L_f + l_X` odd?):** `0 + 1 = 1`. **OK**.\n*   **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` odd?):** `1 + 0 = 1`. **OK**.\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` implies `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n*   This option describes a final state with total spin S=3. However, a system of two nucleons (which are spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. A state with S=3 is physically impossible for this system. Therefore, this transition is not permitted because the final state is non-existent.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X=3`.\n*   **Angular Momentum (`J_f = l_X`?):** `3 = 3`. **OK**.\n*   **Parity (`L_f + l_X` odd?):** `2 + 3 = 5`. **OK**.\n*   **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` odd?):** `1 + 2 = 3`. **OK**.\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X=0`.\n*   **Angular Momentum (`J_f = l_X`?):** `0 = 0`. **OK**.\n*   **Parity (`L_f + l_X` odd?):** `1 + 0 = 1`. **OK**.\n*   **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` odd?):** `1 + 1 = 2`. This is **even**, which violates the condition that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for `T_f = 0`. **NOT OK**.\n*   This transition is not permitted.\n\nBoth options B and D describe forbidden transitions. However, option D is forbidden because it violates the Pauli principle selection rule explicitly provided in the problem statement. Option B is forbidden for a more fundamental reason: the proposed final state `7D1` cannot be formed by two nucleons. In the context of applying the given rules, option D presents a direct violation of those rules.\n\n<<<D>>>"
