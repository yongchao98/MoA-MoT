    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate its mole fraction (α₂) and multiply by 100.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the free Co(II) ions and all the thiocyanato complexes formed:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (βₙ), the concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the free thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n*   [Co(SCN)⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe mole fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, α₂, is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\nα₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions for each species, we get the following formula:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of each term in the denominator:\n*   1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe sum of these terms (the denominator) is:\n1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the dithiocyanato complex:\nβ₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the mole fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo find the percentage, we multiply the mole fraction by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex in the solution is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
