    "The analysis of the chemical reactions and reagents leads to the following conclusions:\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provided are all derivatives of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid, specifically the mono-isobutyl ester. The full name is (R/S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-COO-isobutyl). The stereocenter is at carbon 3, which bears the ethyl group.\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, a six-membered cyclic ester (lactone). The stereocenter in the product is at carbon 4. This carbon corresponds to the stereocenter at carbon 3 of the starting material. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material directly determines the stereochemistry of the product, as the reduction and cyclization reactions do not affect this chiral center.\n\n**Reaction A:**\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4). This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH4 reduces the isobutyl ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid group remains largely unaffected.\n*   **Intermediate:** This reaction forms 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n*   **Final Step:** The intermediate hydroxy acid undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product is **(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Since the reaction preserves the stereocenter, the starting material **A** must have the (R) configuration. Therefore, A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction B:**\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH3). This reagent is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH3 reduces the carboxylic acid group of the starting material to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The isobutyl ester group remains intact.\n*   **Intermediate:** This reaction forms isobutyl 4-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate.\n*   **Final Step:** This intermediate hydroxy ester undergoes an acid-catalyzed intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product is **(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Since the reaction preserves the stereocenter, the starting material **B** must have the (S) configuration. Therefore, B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the known selectivity of the reducing agents and the conservation of stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
