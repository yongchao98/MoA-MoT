    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest Masses and Q-value\n\nFirst, we establish the rest-mass energies of the initial nucleus and the two fragments.\n*   **Initial Nucleus (M):** The rest-mass energy is given as `M * c² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragments (m1 and m2):** Let `m1` be the more massive fragment. We are given two conditions:\n    1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n    2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nBy substituting the first equation into the second, we can solve for the masses of the fragments in terms of `M`:\n*   `2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n*   `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`  => `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n*   `m1 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: `m1 * c² = 0.66 * (300 GeV) = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: `m2 * c² = 0.33 * (300 GeV) = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe **Q-value** is the total kinetic energy released during the fission. This is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy.\n*   `Q = (M * c²) - (m1 * c² + m2 * c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV = 3000 MeV`.\n\n### 2. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, the total kinetic energy `Q` is shared between the two fragments. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momentum.\n*   `p1 = p2` (in magnitude)\n\nThe classical kinetic energy is given by `T = p² / (2m)`. Therefore, the ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p² / (2*m1)) / (p² / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q`\n*   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = Q`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = Q`\n*   `T1_classical = Q / 3 = 3000 MeV / 3 = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics\n\nFor the correct relativistic calculation, we again use the conservation of energy and momentum. The total energy is conserved, and the magnitudes of the momenta are equal. The relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`.\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, `|p1| = |p2|`, which implies `(p1*c)² = (p2*c)²`.\n*   `E1² - (m1*c²)² = E2² - (m2*c²)²`\n*   `E1² - E2² = (m1*c²)² - (m2*c²)²`\n*   `(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c² - m2*c²)(m1*c² + m2*c²) `\n\nFrom the conservation of total energy, `E1 + E2 = M*c² = 300 GeV`. Plugging in the known values:\n*   `(E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV - 99 GeV) * (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `(E1 - E2) * 300 = (99) * (297)`\n*   `E1 - E2 = (99 * 297) / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nAdding the two equations gives:\n*   `2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n*   `E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe relativistic kinetic energy T1 is the total energy of the fragment minus its rest-mass energy (`T1 = E1 - m1*c²`).\n*   `T1 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n*   `T1 = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 4. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1.\n*   Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>"
