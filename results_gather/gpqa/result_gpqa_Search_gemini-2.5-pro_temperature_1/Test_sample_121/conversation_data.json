    "The series of reactions described allows for the step-by-step synthesis of the final product, which is analyzed to determine the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Step 1: α-Bromination of Acetic Acid**\n    Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂) and pyridine in acetic anhydride. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which results in the bromination of the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Fischer Esterification**\n    Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification, which converts the carboxylic acid into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Nucleophilic Substitution**\n    Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Double Alkylation and Cyclization**\n    Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   The methylene protons (CH₂) in ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (the cyano group and the ester carbonyl group).\n    *   Sodium hydride, a strong base, removes one of these acidic protons to form a carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in a nucleophilic substitution reaction.\n    *   Because excess sodium hydride is used, the second acidic proton on the alpha-carbon is also removed, creating a new carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution, attacking the other bromine-bearing carbon at the end of the pentyl chain. This reaction forms a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n### ¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the final product, ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\nThe structure consists of a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1). On an NMR timescale, due to the rapid rotation of the ester group, the molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, its substituents, and the opposing C4 carbon of the ring.\n\nThis symmetry has the following consequences for the proton signals:\n*   **Ethyl Group Protons:** The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are chemically equivalent and produce one signal. The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are also equivalent and produce a second, distinct signal.\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to the protons on C6. However, the two protons on C2 itself (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus not equivalent to each other. This results in two distinct signals for the C2/C6 positions.\n    *   Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to the protons on C5. The two protons on C3 (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic, giving another two distinct signals for the C3/C5 positions.\n    *   The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic and therefore are not chemically equivalent, resulting in two more distinct signals.\n\nCounting these distinct sets of protons:\n1.  -OCH₂CH₃ (Methylene protons)\n2.  -OCH₂CH₃ (Methyl protons)\n3.  Axial protons at C2 and C6\n4.  Equatorial protons at C2 and C6\n5.  Axial protons at C3 and C5\n6.  Equatorial protons at C3 and C5\n7.  Axial proton at C4\n8.  Equatorial proton at C4\n\nIn total, there are **8** chemically distinct hydrogen signals observable in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
