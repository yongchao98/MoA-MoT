    "The search results confirm the validity and form of the Boltzmann equation as used in stellar astrophysics. The equation relates the population of two energy states to the temperature and the energy difference between them. The form I used is correct:\n\nN_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\nThe assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) justifies the use of this equation for stellar photospheres, as it implies that while the star as a whole is not in equilibrium, small regions can be treated as if they are, and a local temperature can be defined. This local temperature, often called the excitation temperature, governs the distribution of atoms among their energy levels according to the Boltzmann distribution.\n\nThe problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This implies that the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the number of atoms in the ground state is twice as large in star 1 compared to star 2.\n\nLet N_b and N_a be the number of atoms in the excited state and ground state, respectively.\nFor Star 1 (Temperature T_1):\n(N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\nFor Star 2 (Temperature T_2):\n(N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nGiven the condition from the problem:\n(N_b / N_a)_1 = 2 * (N_b / N_a)_2\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann expressions:\n(g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe statistical weight term (g_b / g_a) cancels out:\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nRearranging the terms to solve for ln(2):\nln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThe problem provides a crucial piece of information: the energy difference ΔE is approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. The Boltzmann constant, k, is approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE / k is approximately 1.\n\nSubstituting this value into the derived equation:\nln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\nln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2) ]\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
