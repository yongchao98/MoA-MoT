    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the final answer.\n\n### 1. Interpretation of the Problem\n\nFirst, we must interpret the given values and the question.\n\n*   **Proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$)**: $8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s. This is the lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame.\n*   **Mass of $X^0$ ($m_0$)**: 3.41 GeV/c².\n*   **Energy in the Bubble Chamber (E)**: 27 GeV. This is a crucial point. In particle physics problems, \"energy\" can refer to total energy or kinetic energy. Let's test the most plausible interpretation. A common ambiguity in such problems is whether the stated energy is total or kinetic. Assuming it is the *kinetic energy* often resolves these problems correctly, as accelerators are designed to impart kinetic energy.\n*   **\"Observe at least 30% of the decays\"**: To \"observe\" a decay, one must see the track of the parent particle ($X^0$) before it decays. This means the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution. If we want to observe at least 30% of the decays, our resolution must be set to a distance `d` such that at least 30% of the particles travel farther than `d`.\n\nThe number of particles that survive after traveling a distance `x` is given by the exponential decay law $N(x) = N_0 e^{-x/L}$, where `L` is the mean decay length in the lab frame. The probability of a particle traveling a distance greater than `d` is $P(x > d) = e^{-d/L}$.\n\nA standard interpretation in such problems is to calculate the mean decay length, `L`. The probability of a particle traveling further than the mean decay length is $P(x > L) = e^{-1} \\approx 0.368$, or 36.8%. Since 36.8% is \"at least 30%\", the mean decay length `L` is a very plausible candidate for the required resolution.\n\n### 2. Calculation Steps\n\nLet's proceed by assuming the 27 GeV is kinetic energy and the required resolution is the mean decay length `L`.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total energy (E_tot)**\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy.\n$E_{tot} = m_0c^2 + E_k = 3.41 \\text{ GeV} + 27 \\text{ GeV} = 30.41 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor relates total energy to rest mass energy.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E_{tot}}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{30.41 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 8.918$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the mean decay length (L)**\n\nThe mean decay length in the lab frame is the distance the particle travels during its dilated lifetime. It can be calculated with the formula:\n$L = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0$\nwhere `p` is the momentum of the particle.\n\nFirst, we find the momentum `p` using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n$E_{tot}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$\n$(pc)^2 = E_{tot}^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (30.41)^2 - (3.41)^2$\n$(pc)^2 = 924.7681 - 11.6281 = 913.14 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n$pc = \\sqrt{913.14} \\approx 30.218 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nNow, we calculate the decay length `L` using the speed of light c = $3 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n$L = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c \\times \\tau_0$\n$L = \\left(\\frac{30.218 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n$L \\approx 8.8616 \\times (24 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ m})$\n$L \\approx 2.127 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated mean decay length is $L \\approx 2.13 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m\nB) 2.08 x 10⁻³ m\nC) 2.08 x 10⁻⁹ m\nD) 2.08 x 10⁻¹ m\n\nOur calculated value is extremely close to option A. The minor difference of about 2.3% is likely due to rounding in the problem's given values (e.g., the kinetic energy might have been closer to 26.5 GeV, which would yield L ≈ 2.09 x 10⁻⁶ m). The interpretation of the problem as finding the mean decay length under the assumption that the given energy is kinetic provides a result consistent with the provided options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
