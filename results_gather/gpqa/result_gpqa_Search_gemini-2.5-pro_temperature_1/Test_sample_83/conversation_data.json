    "When approximating a matrix exponential function, such as `exp(A)`, with a rational or fractional function `R(A)`, the key to enabling parallel computation lies in the structure of that approximation. A fractional approximation can be expressed as `R(A) = P(A) / Q(A)`, where P and Q are polynomials.\n\nThe conversion of a sequential algorithm into a parallel one is facilitated by the use of a partial fraction expansion of this rational function. If the denominator, `Q(A)`, has distinct roots, the rational function can be decomposed into a sum of simpler fractions. This decomposition allows the original, complex matrix operation to be broken down into several smaller, independent tasks that can be distributed among multiple processors and solved concurrently. Each of these tasks typically involves solving a linear system, and because they are independent, they can be computed in parallel.\n\nTherefore, the ability to express the fractional approximation as a linear sum of partial fractions is the crucial factor that enables the parallelization of the algorithm.\n\n<<<C>>>"
