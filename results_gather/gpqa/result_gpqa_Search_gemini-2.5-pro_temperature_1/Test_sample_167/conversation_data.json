    "All of the listed issues are recognized as potential sources of error in genomics data analysis. To determine which are the *most common* and lead to *difficult-to-spot* erroneous results, an evaluation of each is necessary.\n\n*   **Mutually incompatible data formats:** While using incompatible file formats can cause analyses to fail, these errors are often immediately obvious as the software will typically crash or produce a clear error message. This makes them less likely to be a source of *difficult-to-spot* erroneous results compared to other issues. However, more subtle incompatibilities, such as differences in how data is represented within a file, can lead to hidden errors.\n\n*   **The \"chr\" / \"no chr\" confusion:** This is a very common and often subtle problem. Major genomics data sources like UCSC and Ensembl use different naming conventions for chromosomes (e.g., 'chr1' vs. '1'). If data from these different sources are mixed without standardization, analysis tools may silently fail to match chromosome names, leading to missing data or incorrect results that are not immediately apparent.\n\n*   **Reference assembly mismatch:** This is a critical and frequent source of error. Reference genomes are updated periodically (e.g., hg19/GRCh37 vs. hg38/GRCh38), and these updates can involve significant changes to coordinates and gene models. Using data aligned to different assemblies within the same analysis will lead to incorrect mapping, faulty variant calls, and misleading annotations that can be very difficult to trace back to the source.\n\n*   **Incorrect ID conversion:** This is an exceptionally common and well-documented problem, particularly when using spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel for handling gene lists. Gene symbols that resemble dates (e.g., MARCH1, SEPT2) or floating-point numbers are automatically and often silently converted, leading to irreversible data corruption. Studies have found that this type of error is present in a substantial portion of published genomics papers, with one analysis finding errors in 30.9% of articles with supplementary Excel gene lists. This makes it a prime example of a common and difficult-to-spot error.\n\nBased on the evidence, the \"chr\" / \"no chr\" confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion are all very common issues that can lead to erroneous results that are difficult to detect. While incompatible data formats are a problem, the errors are often more obvious. The other three represent more insidious \"gotchas\" in bioinformatics that can silently corrupt results.\n\n<<<A>>>"
