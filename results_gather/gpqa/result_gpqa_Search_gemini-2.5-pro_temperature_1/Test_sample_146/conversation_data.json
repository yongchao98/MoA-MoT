    "To determine the velocity of particle A, we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum to the annihilation process.\n\nThe process is:\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\n**1. Initial State Analysis**\n*   The problem states that the antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) is \"slowly moving.\" This implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume both the proton ($p$) and the antiproton are effectively at rest.\n*   The total initial energy ($E_i$) is therefore the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. Since a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass, this is twice the rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$).\n*   The rest energy of a proton is approximately 938 MeV.\n*   Therefore, the total initial energy is $E_i = 2 \\times m_p c^2 \\approx 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   Since the particles are at rest, the total initial momentum is zero.\n\n**2. Final State Analysis**\n*   The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n*   The rest mass energy of each particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. To achieve this, the four resulting particles must move away from the annihilation point with speeds that are equal in magnitude.\n*   The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four A particles. The relativistic energy of a single particle is $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n*   Therefore, the total final energy is $E_f = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$.\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy**\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, the initial energy must equal the final energy ($E_i = E_f$).\n\n$2 \\times m_p c^2 = 4 \\times \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWe can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{2 \\times m_p c^2}{4 \\times m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 \\times m_A c^2}$\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{938 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938}{600} \\approx 1.5633$\n\n**4. Calculating the Velocity**\nThe Lorentz factor is related to velocity ($v$) by the equation:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n\nWe rearrange this to solve for $v/c$:\n\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2}$\n\n$1 - v^2/c^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n\n$v^2/c^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, we substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4092} = \\sqrt{0.5908}$\n\n$v/c \\approx 0.7686$\n\nThus, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.96c\nB) 0.77c\nC) 0.91c\nD) 0.86c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
