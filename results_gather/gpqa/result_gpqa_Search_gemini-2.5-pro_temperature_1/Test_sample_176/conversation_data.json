    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** To find the ratio of the luminosities of Star 1 (L₁) and Star 2 (L₂), we can set up the following equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that the radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio of their radii is:\n    R₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n    Squaring this gives:\n    (R₁ / R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio (Wien's Law and Doppler Effect):**\n    *   Wien's Displacement Law states that the intrinsic peak emission wavelength (λ_emitted) of a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature: λ_emitted = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant.\n    *   The problem states that the stars *appeared* brightest at the same wavelength. This refers to the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by the Doppler effect due to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The relationship is λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c), where 'c' is the speed of light.\n    *   For Star 1 (v_r₁ = 0 km/s): λ_obs₁ = λ_emitted₁ * (1 + 0/c) = λ_emitted₁ = b/T₁\n    *   For Star 2 (v_r₂ = 700 km/s): λ_obs₂ = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + v_r₂/c) = (b/T₂) * (1 + v_r₂/c)\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are the same (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂), we can equate the two expressions:\n        b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v_r₂/c)\n    *   This simplifies to the ratio of the temperatures:\n        T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r₂/c)\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now, we substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r₂/c)⁴\n\n    Let's plug in the values:\n    *   v_r₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   v_r₂/c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    Now, calculate the denominator:\n    *   (1 + 0.002333)⁴ ≈ (1.002333)⁴ ≈ 1.00936\n\n    Finally, compute the luminosity ratio:\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>"
