    "To determine the ratio of neutrino fluxes, we must first understand which solar fusion reactions produce neutrinos in the specified energy bands and how the user's hypothetical scenario affects them.\n\n### Analysis of Solar Neutrino Sources\n\nThe Sun produces neutrinos through several reactions in the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle.\n\n*   **pp-I Branch:** This branch's primary reaction (`p + p → d + e⁺ + νe`) produces low-energy neutrinos (up to ~420 keV), which are outside the energy bands in question.\n*   **pp-II Branch:** This branch involves the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (`⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νe`). This reaction is crucial as it produces a very strong flux of neutrinos at a specific energy (a \"line\"). About 90% of these neutrinos are emitted at **861 keV**, placing them squarely in the 800-900 keV band. This branch is **not** stopped in the hypothetical scenario. The total flux of these 861 keV neutrinos is immense, on the order of 5 x 10⁹ particles·cm⁻²·s⁻¹.\n*   **pp-III Branch:** This branch, which the problem states has **stopped**, is the source of Boron-8 (⁸B) neutrinos. These neutrinos have a continuous and broad energy spectrum, extending up to about 15 MeV. Normally, ⁸B neutrinos would contribute to the flux in both the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands.\n*   **CNO Cycle:** This cycle, which is still active, also produces neutrinos with continuous energy spectra (primarily from ¹³N and ¹⁵O decays) that extend across both energy bands. However, the total flux from the CNO cycle is much smaller than the primary pp-chain fluxes, contributing only about 1% to the Sun's total energy and neutrino output. The total CNO neutrino flux is estimated to be around 7.0 x 10⁸ cm⁻²s⁻¹, which is significantly less than the flux from the ⁷Be line.\n\n### Calculating the Flux Ratio\n\nLet's analyze the composition of the neutrino flux in each band under the given conditions:\n\n1.  **Flux (Band 1: 700-800 keV):**\n    *   The contribution from the pp-III branch (⁸B neutrinos) is now **zero**.\n    *   Neutrinos from the pp-II branch (the 861 keV ⁷Be line) are outside this energy range.\n    *   Therefore, the only remaining significant source of neutrinos in this band is the continuous spectrum from the **CNO cycle**.\n\n2.  **Flux (Band 2: 800-900 keV):**\n    *   The contribution from the pp-III branch (⁸B neutrinos) is also **zero**.\n    *   The continuous spectrum from the **CNO cycle** is present in this band as well.\n    *   Crucially, this band contains the very intense and sharp neutrino line from **⁷Be decay at 861 keV**, which originates from the still-active pp-II branch.\n\n### The Ratio\n\nThe ratio is therefore:\n\n**Flux (700-800 keV) / Flux (800-900 keV) = (Flux from CNO) / (Flux from ⁷Be + Flux from CNO)**\n\nThe flux from the ⁷Be line (~5 x 10⁹ cm⁻²s⁻¹) is vastly greater than the CNO flux (~7 x 10⁸ cm⁻²s⁻¹), and the CNO flux is spread over a wide range of energies. The flux density of CNO neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band is very small compared to the enormous, concentrated flux of the ⁷Be line in the 800-900 keV band.\n\nBecause the flux from ⁷Be is so dominant in the denominator, the ratio becomes:\n\n**(A small number) / (A very large number + a small number)**\n\nThis results in a very small fraction. The flux in band 1 (CNO only) is orders of magnitude smaller than the flux in band 2 (dominated by ⁷Be). Comparing the total fluxes, the CNO flux is roughly one-seventh of the ⁷Be flux, and this is distributed over a much wider energy range. An integral over a 100 keV slice of the CNO spectrum will be much smaller than the near-total flux of the ⁷Be line. This leads to a ratio on the order of 1/100, or 0.01.\n\n<<<A>>>"
