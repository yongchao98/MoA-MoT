    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequences to determine the correct option for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### Target Molecule Analysis\n\n*   **Structure:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   -OCH2CH3 (ethoxy): Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   -C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl): Activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   -NO2 (nitro): Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Substitution Pattern (1,2,3):**\n    *   The ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   The ethoxy and nitro groups are *meta* to each other.\n    *   The tert-butyl and nitro groups are *ortho* to each other.\n\n### Strategic Considerations\n\nThe key challenges are the *meta* relationship between the powerful ortho/para-directing ethoxy group and the nitro group, and achieving the crowded 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern. Direct nitration of a molecule containing an ethoxy group would not place the nitro group in the meta position. This suggests the ethoxy group is formed late in the synthesis from a precursor that directs differently or that its directing influence is overcome.\n\nA common and versatile method to introduce a hydroxyl group (a precursor to the ethoxy group) is via the diazotization of an aniline (-NH2), followed by hydrolysis. The aniline itself is typically formed by the reduction of a nitro group. This suggests the following transformation is likely part of the synthesis: -NH2 → -N2+ → -OH → -OEt.\n\nIf this is the case, the key intermediate to synthesize is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n### Evaluation of Synthetic Pathways to 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline and the final product.\n\nLet's evaluate the most plausible synthesis route based on the reactions provided in the options, even if the options themselves appear scrambled. A chemically sound, high-yield synthesis would proceed as follows:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene is reacted with tert-butyl chloride and a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **Sulfonation (Blocking Step):** To control the regiochemistry of the next step, a blocking group is introduced. Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene with fuming sulfuric acid (SO3/H2SO4) places a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) at the para position, which is sterically favored, yielding **p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n3.  **Nitration:** The ring is now nitrated (HNO3/H2SO4). The tert-butyl group directs ortho (since para is blocked), and the sulfonic acid group directs meta. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (ortho to the tert-butyl group), giving **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  **Desulfonation (Removal of Blocking Group):** The sulfonic acid group is removed by heating with dilute sulfuric acid, yielding **o-tert-butylnitrobenzene** (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene). This blocking/deblocking sequence is a standard method to obtain the ortho isomer in high yield, which is normally the minor product of direct nitration.\n5.  **Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine using a reducing agent like iron in hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl), producing **o-tert-butylaniline** (2-tert-butylaniline).\n6.  **Second Nitration:** This is a crucial and non-obvious step. Nitration of o-tert-butylaniline, under carefully controlled conditions, can yield **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. While the amino group is a strong ortho/para director (favoring positions 4 and 6), and the tert-butyl group is an ortho/para director (favoring positions 3 and 5), a combination of steric hindrance at position 3 and reaction control allows for the formation of the desired 3-nitro isomer.\n7.  **Diazotization:** The amino group of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+) using sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid (NaNO2/HCl).\n8.  **Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol by heating with an aqueous acidic solution (H3O+), forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n9.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** Finally, the phenol is converted to the target ethoxy ether by reaction with a base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and an ethylating agent like ethyl bromide (EtBr). This yields **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Analysis of the Given Options\n\nNone of the provided options perfectly match this correct, multi-step synthesis. They appear to be scrambled or contain chemically incorrect steps. However, we must choose the best possible option. Option A contains almost all the necessary reaction types, even if they are in the wrong order. Let's analyze it as written:\n\n**Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n\n*   **Steps i-iii:** `Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene -> p-tert-Butylnitrobenzene -> p-tert-Butylaniline`. This initial sequence is chemically sound but leads to the para isomer, which does not result in the correct final product via simple subsequent steps.\n*   **Step iv:** Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. This gives a different isomer, not the required precursor.\n*   **Steps v-vii:** `Diazotization -> Hydrolysis -> Etherification`. This sequence correctly converts an aniline to an ethoxy group.\n*   **Steps viii-ix:** `Sulfonation -> Desulfonation`. These steps are nonsensical at the end of the synthesis and strongly indicate the option is scrambled.\n\nDespite its flaws, Option A is the only one that presents the core sequence `Reduction (iii) -> Nitration (iv) -> Diazotization (v) -> Hydrolysis (vi) -> Etherification (vii)` in the correct relative order needed to transform an initial nitro compound into the final product, following the logic derived from the literature. This suggests that Option A, while poorly constructed, is the intended answer, assuming a non-high-yield synthesis of the necessary *ortho* intermediate at the beginning.\n\n<<<A>>>"
