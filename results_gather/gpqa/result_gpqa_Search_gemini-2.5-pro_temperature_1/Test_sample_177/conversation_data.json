    "To determine the correct option, we will analyze the given Lagrangian interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$ in two steps. First, we will find the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$. Second, based on the sign of this mass dimension, we will determine if the theory is renormalizable by power-counting.\n\n### 1. Mass Dimension of Îº\n\nIn quantum field theory, using natural units where $\\hbar = c = 1$, the action $S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}$ must be dimensionless. Since the spacetime integral measure $d^4x$ has a mass dimension of $[d^4x] = M^{-4}$, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of $[\\mathcal{L}] = M^4$. This means every term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4.\n\nWe can determine the mass dimensions of the fields from their kinetic terms:\n*   **Fermion field $\\psi$**: The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is $\\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$. For this to have a mass dimension of 4, we have $[\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\partial_\\mu] + [\\psi] = 4$. Since the derivative operator $\\partial_\\mu$ has a mass dimension of 1, this gives $2[\\psi] + 1 = 4$, which implies the fermion field has a mass dimension of $[\\psi] = M^{3/2}$.\n*   **Gauge field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**: The kinetic term for a gauge field is $-\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we require $2[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4$, which means the field strength tensor has a mass dimension of $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^2$.\n*   **Sigma matrix $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$**: The term $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$ is composed of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless constants. Therefore, $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is dimensionless, i.e., $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = M^0$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$. The mass dimension of this term must be 4:\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] + [\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] + [\\psi] + [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4$\n\nSubstituting the known dimensions:\n$[\\kappa] + M^{3/2} + M^0 + M^{3/2} + M^2 = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] + M^3 + M^2 = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] + M^5 = M^4$\n\nSolving for the mass dimension of $\\kappa$:\n$[\\kappa] = M^{4-5} = M^{-1}$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n### 2. Renormalizability\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be assessed using power-counting. A key criterion is the mass dimension of the coupling constants in the theory.\n*   If all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions ($[\\text{coupling}] \\ge 0$), the theory is generally considered renormalizable (or super-renormalizable if the dimension is strictly positive).\n*   If any coupling constant has a negative mass dimension ($[\\text{coupling}] < 0$), the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nIn this case, the coupling constant $\\kappa$ has a mass dimension of -1. A negative mass dimension implies that at higher orders of perturbation theory, loop corrections will introduce divergences that are more severe. To cancel these new types of divergences, an infinite number of counterterms would be required, which are not present in the original Lagrangian. This makes the theory lose its predictive power at high energies, and thus it is considered non-renormalizable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, and because this dimension is negative, the theory is non-renormalizable. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
