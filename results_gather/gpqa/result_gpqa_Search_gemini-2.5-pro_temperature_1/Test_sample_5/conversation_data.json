    "To find the energy spectrum for a particle of mass *m* in the given potential, we first need to express the potential in a more convenient coordinate system.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nWe can convert this to Cartesian coordinates using the transformations:\n*   x = r cos(θ)\n*   y = r sin(θ)\n*   r² = x² + y²\n\nFrom these, we can see that x² = r² cos²(θ). Substituting these into the potential energy equation gives:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k(x²)\nV(x, y) = (1/2 kx² + 3/2 kx²) + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\nThis potential is the sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction. The Schrödinger equation for this system is separable, meaning we can solve the one-dimensional problems independently and add the energies. The total energy E will be the sum of the energies in the x and y directions, E = E_x + E_y.\n\nThe standard form for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator potential is V(q) = 1/2 mω²q², and its energy spectrum is E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω.\n\n**For the x-direction:**\nThe potential is V_x(x) = 2kx².\nWe equate this to the standard form to find the angular frequency ω_x:\n1/2 mω_x²x² = 2kx²\nmω_x² = 4k\nω_x = √(4k/m) = 2√(k/m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the x-direction are:\nE_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ(2√(k/m))\n\n**For the y-direction:**\nThe potential is V_y(y) = 1/2 ky².\nWe equate this to the standard form to find the angular frequency ω_y:\n1/2 mω_y²y² = 1/2 ky²\nmω_y² = k\nω_y = √(k/m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the y-direction are:\nE_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\n\n**Total Energy:**\nThe total energy E is the sum of the energies for the x and y motions.\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħ(2√(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\nE = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2) ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ√(k/m)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
