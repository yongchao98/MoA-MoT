    "This problem can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum from special relativity.\n\nFirst, we determine the initial energy and momentum of the electron-positron system. The energy (E) and momentum (p) of a particle with rest mass (m) and Lorentz factor (γ) are given by:\n*   E = γmc²\n*   p = γmv = γβmc, where β = v/c\n\n**Initial State (before collision):**\n\n1.  **Electron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ_e) = 4\n    *   Energy (E_e) = 4m_ec²\n    *   Velocity factor (β_e)² = 1 - 1/γ_e² = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16, so β_e = √15 / 4.\n    *   Momentum (p_e) = γ_e * β_e * m_ec = 4 * (√15 / 4) * m_ec = √15 * m_ec. The direction is to the right (positive).\n\n2.  **Positron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ_p) = 2\n    *   Energy (E_p) = 2m_ec² (a positron has the same mass as an electron).\n    *   Velocity factor (β_p)² = 1 - 1/γ_p² = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4, so β_p = √3 / 2.\n    *   Momentum (p_p) = γ_p * β_p * m_ec = 2 * (√3 / 2) * m_ec = √3 * m_ec. Since it's moving from the right, its momentum is directed to the left (negative). So, p_p = -√3 * m_ec.\n\n3.  **Total Initial System:**\n    *   Total Energy (E_initial) = E_e + E_p = 4m_ec² + 2m_ec² = 6m_ec²\n    *   Total Momentum (p_initial) = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)m_ec. This momentum is entirely along the horizontal (x-axis).\n\n**Final State (after annihilation):**\n\nThe annihilation produces two photons of equal energy. Let the energy of each photon be E_γ. The momentum of a photon is p_γ = E_γ/c.\n\n*   One photon moves \"upper-right\" at an angle θ to the horizontal axis.\n*   The other moves \"lower-right\" at an angle -φ to the horizontal axis.\n\n**Applying Conservation Laws:**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   6m_ec² = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ\n    *   This gives the energy of each photon: E_γ = 3m_ec²\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    Momentum must be conserved in both the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) directions.\n    *   **Vertical (y) momentum:** The initial momentum in the y-direction is zero. Therefore, the final y-momentum must also be zero.\n        *   p_γ * sin(θ) + p_γ * sin(-φ) = 0\n        *   p_γ * sin(θ) - p_γ * sin(φ) = 0\n        *   sin(θ) = sin(φ), which means θ = φ. The angles the photons make with the horizontal axis are equal in magnitude.\n\n    *   **Horizontal (x) momentum:** The initial x-momentum must equal the final x-momentum.\n        *   p_initial = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(θ)\n        *   (√15 - √3)m_ec = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)\n\nNow, we substitute the known values for p_γ (since p_γ = E_γ/c = 3m_ec²/c = 3m_ec):\n*   (√15 - √3)m_ec = 2 * (3m_ec) * cos(θ)\n*   (√15 - √3) = 6 * cos(θ)\n*   cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n\n**Calculating the Angle:**\n\nUsing the values √15 ≈ 3.873 and √3 ≈ 1.732:\n*   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n*   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons. This is the sum of the magnitudes of their individual angles with the horizontal axis, which is θ + φ. Since θ = φ, the total angle is 2θ.\n\nTotal Angle = 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°\n\nThis value is very close to 138. The use of conservation of energy and momentum is a fundamental approach to solving such collision problems in physics.\n\n<<<A>>>"
