    "Here is the step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of neutralization:\n\n### 1. Identify Reactants and their Properties\n\n*   **Hydrochloric acid (HCl):** A strong acid.\n*   **Sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄):** A strong acid.\n*   **Barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂):** A strong base.\n\nThe reaction involves strong acids and a strong base, so we can use the standard enthalpy of neutralization. Additionally, the reaction between sulfuric acid and barium hydroxide will form a precipitate, Barium Sulfate (BaSO₄), which also involves an enthalpy change.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ Ions\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles H⁺ = 0.500 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.10 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄:**\n    *   H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid (provides 2 H⁺ ions).\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles H⁺ = 0.300 L * 0.3 mol/L * 2 = 0.18 mol\n\n*   **Total Moles of H⁺:**\n    *   Total H⁺ = 0.10 mol + 0.18 mol = 0.28 mol\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 OH⁻ ions.\n    *   Volume = 200 mL = 0.200 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.5 M\n    *   Moles OH⁻ = 0.200 L * 0.5 mol/L * 2 = 0.20 mol\n\n### 3. Determine the Limiting Reactant for Neutralization\n\nThe neutralization reaction is: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O.\n*   We have 0.28 mol of H⁺ and 0.20 mol of OH⁻.\n*   The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) is the limiting reactant.\n*   Therefore, the number of moles of water formed is **0.20 mol**.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Neutralization\n\nThe standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and a strong base is approximately **-13.7 kcal/mol** of water formed.\n*   Heat released from neutralization = Moles of H₂O formed × Enthalpy of neutralization\n*   Heat released = 0.20 mol * (-13.7 kcal/mol) = **-2.74 kcal**\n\n### 5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Precipitation\n\nThe reaction between barium ions (from Ba(OH)₂) and sulfate ions (from H₂SO₄) forms a precipitate, BaSO₄(s).\n*   **Reaction:** Ba²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → BaSO₄(s)\n\n*   **Calculate moles of Ba²⁺ and SO₄²⁻ ions:**\n    *   Moles of Ba²⁺ = 0.200 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Moles of SO₄²⁻ = 0.300 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol\n\n*   **Determine the limiting reactant for precipitation:**\n    *   The sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻) is the limiting reactant.\n    *   Therefore, the number of moles of BaSO₄ precipitated is **0.09 mol**.\n\n*   **Find the enthalpy of precipitation for BaSO₄:**\n    The enthalpy of precipitation is the negative of the enthalpy of solution. The standard enthalpy of crystallization of BaSO₄ (formation from its aqueous ions) is given as **-4.5 kcal/mol**.\n    *   ΔH_precip = -4.5 kcal/mol\n\n*   **Calculate the heat released from precipitation:**\n    *   Heat released = Moles of BaSO₄ formed × Enthalpy of precipitation\n    *   Heat released = 0.09 mol * (-4.5 kcal/mol) = **-0.405 kcal**\n\n### 6. Calculate the Total Enthalpy Change\n\nThe total enthalpy change is the sum of the enthalpy change from neutralization and the enthalpy change from precipitation.\n*   Total Enthalpy = Enthalpy of Neutralization + Enthalpy of Precipitation\n*   Total Enthalpy = (-2.74 kcal) + (-0.405 kcal) = **-3.145 kcal**\n\nThis value is not among the options. Let's re-evaluate the enthalpy of neutralization value. The value -13.7 kcal/mol is an approximation. Sometimes a value of -13.6 kcal/mol is used. Let's try that.\n\n*   Heat from neutralization = 0.20 mol * (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal\n*   Total Enthalpy = (-2.72 kcal) + (-0.405 kcal) = -3.125 kcal\n\nThis is still not matching any option. Let's re-examine the problem. It is possible that the problem expects us to ignore the enthalpy of precipitation, as it is often considered negligible compared to the enthalpy of neutralization or is omitted in textbook problems for simplicity.\n\n### Recalculation Ignoring Enthalpy of Precipitation\n\nIf we only consider the enthalpy of neutralization:\n*   Moles of water formed = 0.20 mol\n*   Standard enthalpy of neutralization = -13.7 kcal/mol\n*   Heat released = 0.20 mol * (-13.7 kcal/mol) = **-2.74 kcal**\n\nThis value is very close to option C. The small difference might arise from using a slightly different value for the standard enthalpy of neutralization, like -13.6 kcal/mol, which gives -2.72 kcal.\n\nLet's check the other options.\nOption A) -3.80 kcal\nOption B) -11.42 kcal\nOption D) -16.0 kJ = -16.0 / 4.184 kcal ≈ -3.82 kcal\n\nBoth options A and D are very close to -3.8 kcal. Let's see if we can arrive at this value.\nTotal moles of acid equivalents = (0.5 L * 0.2 M) + (0.3 L * 0.3 M * 2) = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 eq\nTotal moles of base equivalents = 0.2 L * 0.5 M * 2 = 0.20 eq\nMoles of water formed = 0.20 mol.\n\nPerhaps there is an error in my calculation or the standard values used. Let's re-evaluate the total heat. What if we use the total acid equivalents?\n0.28 eq * -13.7 kcal/eq = -3.836 kcal.\n\nThis calculation matches options A and D. This implies the calculation should be based on the total gram equivalents of acid that are reacting. However, the reaction is limited by the base. The base has 0.20 gram equivalents.\n\nLet's re-read the question carefully. \"Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when... are mixed\". It doesn't ask for the total heat released, but the \"enthalpy of neutralization\". This is often expressed per mole. However, the answers are in kcal, suggesting a total energy value.\n\nLet's assume the question is asking for the total heat released.\nThe limiting reagent is Ba(OH)2, with 0.20 gram equivalents.\nHeat released = 0.20 eq * (-13.7 kcal/eq) = -2.74 kcal. (This matches option C)\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the question is flawed and intends to use the moles of H+ instead.\nHeat released = 0.28 mol * (-13.7 kcal/mol) = -3.836 kcal. (This matches option A and D).\n\nWhy would the calculation be based on the moles of acid? It shouldn't be, as the base is the limiting reactant. Let's stick to the fundamentals. The amount of reaction is determined by the limiting reactant.\n\n1.  **Moles of H+ = 0.28 mol**\n2.  **Moles of OH- = 0.20 mol**\n3.  **Limiting reactant = OH-**\n4.  **Moles of H2O formed = 0.20 mol**\n5.  **Heat of neutralization per mole = -13.7 kcal/mol**\n6.  **Total heat of neutralization = 0.20 mol * (-13.7 kcal/mol) = -2.74 kcal**\n7.  This is closest to **-2.72 kcal**.\n\nLet's assume the value -13.6 kcal/mol is the intended standard.\nTotal heat of neutralization = 0.20 mol * (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal.\n\nNow, let's consider the heat of precipitation again.\nMoles of BaSO4 = 0.09 mol\nHeat of precipitation = -4.5 kcal/mol\nHeat from precipitation = 0.09 mol * -4.5 kcal/mol = -0.405 kcal\nTotal heat = -2.72 kcal + (-0.405 kcal) = -3.125 kcal. This is not an option.\n\nThere seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement or the options provided. However, if we must choose the best option, the calculation based on the limiting reagent for the neutralization reaction is the most chemically sound approach. This leads to a value of approximately -2.72 kcal. The question asks to *calculate the enthalpy of neutralization*, which might be interpreted as ignoring other thermal effects like precipitation.\n\nLet's review the possibility of -3.80 kcal being correct. This value is obtained if we erroneously use the total moles of H+ (0.28 mol) instead of the limiting moles of OH- (0.20 mol).\n0.28 mol * -13.6 kcal/mol = -3.808 kcal.\n\nIt is a common mistake in setting up such problems where the intended answer corresponds to an incorrect application of the limiting reactant principle. Given the options, it is highly likely that the intended calculation was based on the total moles of H+, despite it being in excess.\n\nLet's proceed with the most plausible intended answer, which seems to be based on a common mistake.\n\n**Calculation based on total moles of H+:**\n*   Total moles of H⁺ = 0.28 mol\n*   Using the standard enthalpy of neutralization of -13.6 kcal/mol:\n*   Enthalpy change = 0.28 mol * (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -3.808 kcal\n\nThis value is extremely close to option A.\n\nLet's re-confirm the standard value. -13.7 kcal/mol and -57.1 kJ/mol are the most common values.\n-57.1 kJ/mol / 4.184 kJ/kcal = -13.65 kcal/mol.\n0.28 mol * -13.65 kcal/mol = -3.822 kcal. This is very close to A and D (-16.0 kJ = -3.82 kcal).\n\nLet's assume the question is asking for the enthalpy change per equivalent of the limiting reactant, which is Ba(OH)2.\nTotal equivalents of base = 0.200 L * 0.5 M * 2 = 0.20 eq.\nThe problem is that the answers are not given in kcal/eq.\n\nLet's try one more time with the chemically correct method:\nMoles of H2O formed = 0.20 mol\nEnthalpy of neutralization = -13.7 kcal/mol\nHeat released = 0.20 mol * -13.7 kcal/mol = -2.74 kcal\nThis matches option C (-2.72 kcal). The small discrepancy is likely due to using -13.6 vs -13.7 kcal/mol.\n\nLet's compare the two possibilities:\n1.  **Chemically Correct Method:** Limiting reactant is OH- (0.20 mol). Heat released = 0.20 mol * ~-13.6 kcal/mol = -2.72 kcal. **This matches option C.**\n2.  **Flawed Method (Using Excess Reactant):** Excess reactant is H+ (0.28 mol). Heat released = 0.28 mol * ~-13.6 kcal/mol = -3.81 kcal. **This matches option A.**\n\nIn educational and testing contexts, it is crucial to follow the correct chemical principles. The amount of reaction is always dictated by the limiting reactant. Therefore, the first method is the correct one. The heat of precipitation for BaSO4 should ideally be included, but its omission is common in such problems, and including it does not lead to any of the given answers. Thus, ignoring it and focusing on neutralization is the intended path.\n\nFinal check of the correct method:\nMoles of H⁺ = 0.28 mol.\nMoles of OH⁻ = 0.20 mol.\nSince H⁺ > OH⁻, the base is the limiting reactant.\nThe reaction consumes 0.20 mol of OH⁻ and 0.20 mol of H⁺ to form 0.20 mol of H₂O.\nHeat Evolved = Moles of H₂O formed × Standard Enthalpy of Neutralization\nHeat Evolved = 0.20 mol × 13.6 kcal/mol = 2.72 kcal.\nSince heat is evolved, the enthalpy change is negative.\nΔH = -2.72 kcal.\n\nFinal decision leans towards C as it's derived from the fundamentally correct application of stoichiometry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
