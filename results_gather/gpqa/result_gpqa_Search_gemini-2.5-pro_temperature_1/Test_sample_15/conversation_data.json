    "A molecule will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key condition for chirality is the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion within the molecule.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond and does not possess any chiral centers. The molecule itself is planar and therefore has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors \"(3aR,7aS)\", which explicitly define the three-dimensional arrangement at two chiral centers. A compound specified as a single enantiomer is, by definition, chiral and will be optically active. This complex bridged-ring structure does not have a plane of symmetry that would make it a meso compound. Therefore, it is optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule contains two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond. This type of compound is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers and are therefore optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule is a diastereomer of the meso form described above. In the (2R, 3R) configuration, there is no internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. The molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical activity. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S, 3S) enantiomer.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The \"(R)\" designation in the name indicates a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound is also known as cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This arrangement gives the molecule three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one hydroxyl group and the opposite carbon atom of the ring. Due to these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An analysis of the structure, CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl, reveals that it does not contain any chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, and no other carbon atom has four different substituents. The molecule is achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
