    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. For two planets orbiting the same star, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures can be expressed in terms of their semi-major axes (`a`) and albedos (`A`). The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere T_star is the star's temperature and R_star is its radius.\n\nSince the problem states that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2) and orbit the same star (T_star and R_star are constant), the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 simplifies to:\n\n**T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)**\n\nOur goal is to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a2 / a1.\n\n### Step 2: Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters\nThe problem provides the Doppler shift (Δλ) for each planet, which is used to determine the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K). The relationship between the observed Doppler shift and radial velocity is given by the Doppler formula. The maximum radial velocity (K) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ):\n\nK = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\n\nWhere `c` is the speed of light and λ₀ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line (6300 Å).\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (`a`) by the following equation:\n\n**K = M_p * sqrt(G / (a * M_star))**\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes\nWe can rearrange the formula from Step 2 to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\na = (G * M_p²) / (K² * M_star)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a2 / a1:\n\na2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2²) / (K2² * M_star)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (K1² * M_star)]\n\nThe constants G and M_star cancel out, leaving:\n\n**a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Ratios of Masses and Radial Velocities\nFrom the problem statement:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 (M_p1) = 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet 2 (M_p2) = 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 (Δλ_1) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 (Δλ_2) = 0.04 Å\n\nThe ratio of the masses is:\nM_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\nSince K is directly proportional to Δλ, the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is:\nK1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio\nSubstitute the results from Step 3 and Step 4 into the equation from Step 1:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)² )\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)\n\nNow, plug in the numerical ratios:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n**T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357**\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
