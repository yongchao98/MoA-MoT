    "To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the total electrostatic potential energy. The system consists of 13 identical particles, each with a charge `q = 2e`. One particle is fixed at a central point P, and the other 12 are constrained to a distance `r = 2 m` from P, meaning they lie on the surface of a sphere with radius `r`.\n\nThe total potential energy (`U_total`) is the sum of two components:\n1.  The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere (`U_center_sphere`).\n2.  The potential energy from the interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere (`U_sphere`).\n\n**1. Central-Sphere Energy (`U_center_sphere`)**\n\nThe potential energy between the central charge (`q`) and any single charge (`q`) on the sphere is given by Coulomb's law: `U = k * q^2 / r`, where:\n*   `k` is Coulomb's constant, approximately `8.98755 × 10^9 N·m²/C²`.\n*   `q` is the charge of each particle, which is `2e`.\n*   `e` is the elementary charge, `1.602176634 × 10^-19 C`.\n*   `r` is the distance from the center, `2 m`.\n\nThe charge `q` is `2 * 1.602176634 × 10^-19 C = 3.204353268 × 10^-19 C`.\nSince there are 12 such interactions, the total energy is:\n`U_center_sphere = 12 * (k * q^2 / r)`\n`U_center_sphere = 12 * (8.98755 × 10^9 * (3.204353268 × 10^-19)^2 / 2)`\n`U_center_sphere ≈ 5.537 × 10^-27 J`\n\n**2. Sphere-Sphere Energy (`U_sphere`)**\n\nTo achieve the minimum energy for the entire system, the 12 charges on the sphere must arrange themselves to minimize their mutual repulsion. This is a classic physics problem known as the Thomson problem. For 12 charges, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the particles are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe potential energy of this configuration is the sum of the potential energies for all unique pairs of the 12 charges. This can be written as:\n`U_sphere = (k * q^2 / r) * E_12`\nHere, `E_12` is the dimensionless energy constant for the 12-charge icosahedral solution to the Thomson problem. The value of `E_12` is approximately 49.165.\n\n`U_sphere = ( (8.98755 × 10^9 * (3.204353268 × 10^-19)^2) / 2 ) * 49.165`\n`U_sphere ≈ 2.269 × 10^-26 J`\n\n**Total Minimum Energy**\n\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of these two components:\n`U_total = U_center_sphere + U_sphere`\n`U_total ≈ 5.537 × 10^-27 J + 2.269 × 10^-26 J`\n`U_total ≈ 0.5537 × 10^-26 J + 2.269 × 10^-26 J`\n`U_total ≈ 2.8227 × 10^-26 J`\n\nRounding to three decimal places, the minimum energy is `2.823 x 10^-26 J`. Using more precise values for the constants (`e` = 1.602176634×10⁻¹⁹ C, `k` = 8.9875517923×10⁹ N⋅m²⋅C⁻², and `E_12` = 49.1653069) yields a result of `2.822469 x 10^-26 J`, which rounds to `2.822 x 10^-26 J`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
