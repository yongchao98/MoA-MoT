    "Here is a breakdown of the optical isomerism for each of the specified organic moieties:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Optical isomerism can occur in biphenyl compounds when there is restricted rotation around the single bond that connects the two phenyl rings. This restriction, known as atropisomerism, happens when there are large, bulky groups in the ortho positions (the positions adjacent to the connecting bond). In this case, the nitro groups (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at the 2, 2', 6, and 6' positions are large enough to prevent the rings from rotating freely. This creates two stable, non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), meaning the compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, the central carbon atom (the second carbon) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is known as a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are optically active (with the exception of meso compounds, which is not applicable here). Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has two optical isomers (enantiomers).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: In this molecule, the central carbon atom is part of a carbonyl group (C=O) and is also bonded to two phenyl groups. Because this carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, it is sp2 hybridized and has a trigonal planar geometry. To exhibit optical isomerism based on a chiral center, an atom typically must be sp3 hybridized and bonded to four different groups. Benzophenone has a plane of symmetry and is achiral, thus it does not show optical isomerism on its own.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans* isomer of an alkene. While it is a stereoisomer (a geometric isomer of dimethyl maleate), it does not exhibit optical isomerism. The molecule possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
