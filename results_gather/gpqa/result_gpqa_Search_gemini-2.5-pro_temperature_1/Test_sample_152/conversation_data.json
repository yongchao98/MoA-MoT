    "Here is a breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions:\n\n**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n*   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate. The acidic α-hydrogen is removed by the sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) base to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The nucleophile will attack the electrophilic β-carbon.\n*   **Reaction:** The enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. Subsequent protonation of the resulting enolate intermediate by the ethanol (EtOH) solvent yields the final product.\n*   **Product (A):** The resulting structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH–CH(p-tolyl)–CH₂–COOCH₃`. When named as a substituted propane with three carboxylate groups, the correct IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n*   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which serves as a nucleophile. The nucleophilic carbon is the α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone). This type of reaction is known as the Stork enamine synthesis.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile). The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon.\n*   **Reaction and Workup:** After the initial Michael addition, an iminium ion intermediate is formed. The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes this intermediate, converting the enamine back into a ketone.\n*   **Product (B):** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a substituent at the 2-position derived from the butanenitrile. The major product is the more stable keto form, which is named **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n**Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** But-3-en-2-one, commonly known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), is a classic Michael acceptor.\n*   **Product:** The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The (3-oxobutyl) group (`–CH₂CH₂C(=O)CH₃`) is the remnant of the MVK after the addition.\n*   **Reactant (C) (Michael Donor):** Working backward from the product, the donor must be the part to which the MVK fragment is attached. The C-2 position of a 1,3-dione is highly acidic due to the two adjacent carbonyl groups and is readily deprotonated by a base like KOH to form a nucleophilic enolate. Therefore, reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
