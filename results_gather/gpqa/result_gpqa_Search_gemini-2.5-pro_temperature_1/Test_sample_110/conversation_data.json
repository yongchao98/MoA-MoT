    "The final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n**Reaction 1: Michael Addition**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants and reaction type:** The first reaction is a Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This ketone will be deprotonated to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (an α,β-unsaturated ester).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Determine the site of enolate formation:** The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with both an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no α-hydrogens.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom.\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) can only abstract the single α-hydrogen from C6. Therefore, the enolate is formed exclusively at the C6 position.\n\n3.  **Predict the product of the Michael addition:** The C6-enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate in a conjugate (1,4) addition. A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety. After a protonation step, the final product **A** is formed.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure and name of Product A:**\n    *   The structure is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To match the options provided, the product must be named treating the cyclohexanone ring as a substituent on the propanoate chain. The main chain is `ethyl ...propanoate`. The substituent is attached to the third carbon (C3) of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclic substituent, the ring is numbered starting from the point of attachment (the original C6 of the ketone).\n        *   New C1 is the attachment point (original C6), which has a methyl group.\n        *   New C2 is the original C1, which bears the keto group (=O).\n        *   New C3 is the original C2, which has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the name of the substituent is (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full IUPAC name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction 2: Michael Addition of a Nitroalkane**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants and reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon α to the nitro group are acidic.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃CH=CHCN), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n\n2.  **Determine the nucleophile:** The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, forming a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion), `[CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Predict the product of the Michael addition:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile. Subsequent protonation (from H₂O) yields the final product **B**.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure and name of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon chain is numbered starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group has six carbons (hexanenitrile).\n    *   Numbering the chain: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full IUPAC name for product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
