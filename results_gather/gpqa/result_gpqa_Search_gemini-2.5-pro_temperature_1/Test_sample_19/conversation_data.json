    "The impulse approximation in many-body nuclear physics is based on a set of simplifying assumptions that allow the complex interaction of a probe with a nucleus to be treated as a collection of interactions with individual, free nucleons. To determine which of the given assumptions jointly imply this approximation, we can analyze their physical meaning.\n\n*   **1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the foundational concept of the impulse approximation. It assumes the probe interacts with a single nucleon at a time, ignoring more complex interactions like meson exchange currents where the probe interacts with the force-carrying particles between nucleons.\n\n*   **2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This assumption neglects final-state interactions (FSI). It posits that after the initial interaction, the struck nucleon (or the probe itself) exits the nucleus without any further scattering off the other (A-1) nucleons. If such interactions were included, the nucleon would not behave as if it were free.\n\n*   **4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the \"impulse\" aspect of the approximation. The interaction is assumed to happen over such a short timescale that the binding forces holding the nucleon within the nucleus are negligible during the collision. For the moment of interaction, the nucleon is treated as a free particle, unbound from the nuclear potential.\n\nAssumption **3 (The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic)** deals with the internal structure of the nucleon itself. While models of nucleon structure are essential for calculating interaction cross-sections, the impulse approximation itself is concerned with the nucleon's behavior *within the nucleus*, not its internal quark dynamics. Relativistic effects of quarks can be considered separately from the assumptions that define the impulse approximation.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that collectively define the impulse approximation are that the interaction targets a single nucleon (1), this nucleon is treated as unbound during the interaction (4), and there are no subsequent interactions with the rest of the nucleus (2).\n\n<<<D>>>"
