    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Induced Charges:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity attracts free electrons from the conductor. This results in a charge of `-q` being induced on the inner surface of the cavity. Because the conductor was initially uncharged, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conducting material shields the region outside the conductor from the electric fields of the charges inside the cavity (the original `+q` and the induced `-q`). The combined electric field from the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity's inner surface is zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Field at Point P:** Consequently, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is caused *only* by the charge `+q` residing on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Symmetry and Gauss's Law:** Since the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere, the induced charge `+q` distributes itself uniformly over this surface. According to Gauss's law (and the shell theorem), for any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is the same as that of a point charge with the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n\n5.  **Calculation:** The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. The center of the spherical conductor is at a distance `L` from the point P. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at P is equivalent to the field from a point charge `+q` located at the center of the big sphere.\n\nThe formula for the electric field from a point charge is:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d^2}$\n\nIn this case, the effective charge is `q` and the distance from the center is `L`. Thus, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe other parameters, such as the cavity's radius `r`, its position `s`, the distance `l`, and the angle `Î¸`, are irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the principle of electrostatic shielding.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, option D is the correct one.\n\n<<<D>>>"
