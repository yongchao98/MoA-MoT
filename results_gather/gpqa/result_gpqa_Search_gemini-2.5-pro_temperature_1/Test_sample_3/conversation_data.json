    "In a universe where magnetic monopoles (isolated north or south poles) exist, two of Maxwell's equations would be fundamentally different to account for this new physical reality.\n\nThe existence of magnetic monopoles would require modifications to:\n*   **Gauss's law for magnetism (the divergence of the magnetic field):** In our universe, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇⋅B) is zero. This is a mathematical statement that magnetic monopoles do not exist; magnetic field lines always form closed loops and never start or end at a point. If magnetic monopoles existed, they would act as sources or sinks for the magnetic field, just as electric charges do for the electric field. Consequently, the divergence of the magnetic field would be proportional to the magnetic charge density (ρm), and the equation would be modified.\n*   **Faraday's law of induction (the circulation of the electric field):** Just as moving electric charges constitute an electric current (J) which creates a magnetic field, moving magnetic monopoles would constitute a magnetic current (Jm). This new magnetic current would induce a circulating electric field, adding a new term to Faraday's law. This would make the equations for electricity and magnetism much more symmetrical.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would change are the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the one related to the circulation (or curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<B>>>"
