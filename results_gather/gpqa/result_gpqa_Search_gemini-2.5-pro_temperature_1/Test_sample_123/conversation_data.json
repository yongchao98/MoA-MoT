    "The problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay. The fraction of particles that survive to reach the detector wall is determined by their lifetime in the laboratory's frame of reference, which is extended due to their high velocity.\n\n### Key Principles:\n*   **Particle Decay:** The number of unstable particles (N) remaining after a time (t) from an initial sample (N₀) is given by the exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_lab)`, where `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the laboratory's reference frame.\n*   **Time Dilation:** Due to relativistic effects, the lifetime of a moving particle as measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (its proper lifetime, `τ_proper`). This relationship is defined by the Lorentz factor (γ): `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n*   **Survival Fraction:** The fraction of particles reaching the detector is N/N₀.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    The time it takes for the particles to travel from the center to the detector wall (radius R = 30 m) in the lab frame is `t = R / v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t ≈ R / c`.\n\n    Substituting this and the time-dilated lifetime into the decay law gives the fraction of surviving particles:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(- (R/c) / (γ * τ_proper) )`\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ_proper))`\n\n2.  **Use the Initial Conditions:**\n    We are given that when the Lorentz factor (γ₁) is 20, one-third (1/3) of the particles reach the detector.\n    `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * c * τ_proper))`\n\n    To simplify, we can solve for the constant term `30 / (c * τ_proper)`, which represents the ratio of the detector radius to the particle's mean decay length at rest.\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ_proper)`\n    `-ln(3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ_proper)`\n    `20 * ln(3) = 30 / (c * τ_proper)`\n\n3.  **Use the Target Conditions to Find the New Lorentz Factor:**\n    We need to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂) that allows two-thirds (2/3) of the particles to reach the detector.\n    `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * c * τ_proper))`\n\n    Again, take the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ_proper)`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ_proper)`\n    `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 30 / (c * τ_proper)`\n\n4.  **Solve for γ₂:**\n    Now we have two expressions for the constant `30 / (c * τ_proper)`. We can set them equal to each other:\n    `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    Solving for γ₂:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986) / (0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. Comparing this to the given options, the closest value is 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"
