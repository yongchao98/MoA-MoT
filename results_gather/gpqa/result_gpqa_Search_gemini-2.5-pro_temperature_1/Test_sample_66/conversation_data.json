    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-component of orbital angular momentum for two electrons to both be `-ħ`, given that the 2-electron system is in a specific coupled angular momentum state.\n\n### Analysis of the State and Measurement\n\n1.  **System:** The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. For a p-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l = 1`.\n2.  **Individual Particle States (Uncoupled Basis):**\n    *   For electron 1: `l₁ = 1`. The possible z-component quantum numbers are `m₁ = -1, 0, 1`.\n    *   For electron 2: `l₂ = 1`. The possible z-component quantum numbers are `m₂ = -1, 0, 1`.\n    *   The states in the uncoupled basis are denoted by `|l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂>`, or simply `|m₁, m₂>` since `l₁` and `l₂` are fixed at 1.\n3.  **Coupled State:** The system is in the state `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. This is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operator `L²` (with `l=2`) and the total z-component of angular momentum operator `L_z` (with `m=-1`).\n4.  **The Measurement:** A measurement of the individual z-components of angular momentum, `L₁z` and `L₂z`, is performed.\n5.  **Desired Outcome:** We want to find the probability of getting an eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L₁z` **and** `-ħ` for `L₂z`.\n    *   An eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L₁z` corresponds to the state where `m₁ = -1`.\n    *   An eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L₂z` corresponds to the state where `m₂ = -1`.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state `|m₁, m₂> = |-1, -1>`.\n\n### The Fundamental Principle (Selection Rule)\n\nThe connection between the coupled basis `|l, m>` and the uncoupled basis `|l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂>` is governed by the rules of angular momentum addition, using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nA fundamental principle, or selection rule, for the addition of angular momentum is that the total z-component quantum number `m` must be the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers `m₁` and `m₂`.\n\n> `m = m₁ + m₂`\n\nThis rule arises because the operator for the total z-component of angular momentum `L_z` is simply the sum of the individual operators: `L_z = L₁z + L₂z`. The state `|l, m>` is an eigenstate of `L_z` with eigenvalue `mħ`. The state `|l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂>` is also an eigenstate of `L_z`, and its eigenvalue is `(m₁ + m₂)ħ`. For the coupled state to have any component of a particular uncoupled state, their `L_z` eigenvalues must be the same, which means `m` must equal `m₁ + m₂`.\n\n### Applying the Principle to the Problem\n\n*   The system is in the coupled state `|l=2, m=-1>`. So, `m = -1`.\n*   The measurement outcome we are interested in corresponds to the uncoupled state where `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n*   For this outcome, the sum is `m₁ + m₂ = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n\nWe compare the total `m` of the system with the sum required for the desired outcome:\n*   `m` of the system = -1\n*   `m₁ + m₂` of the desired measurement = -2\n\nSince `m ≠ m₁ + m₂` (`-1 ≠ -2`), the selection rule is violated. This means that the coupled state `|2, -1>` has no component of the uncoupled state `|-1, -1>`.\n\nThe probability of measuring `m₁` and `m₂` is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, `|<l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂ | l, m>|²`. Because the selection rule `m = m₁ + m₂` is not satisfied, this coefficient is zero.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring `L₁z = -ħ` and `L₂z = -ħ` is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>"
