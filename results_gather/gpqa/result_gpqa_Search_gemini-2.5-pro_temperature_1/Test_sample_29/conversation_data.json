    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we must first understand the relationship between emitted light, absorbed light, and the perceived color of a substance.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Wavelength of Emitted Light:** The energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. We can convert this energy to a corresponding wavelength using the formula λ = hc/E, where a convenient approximation is λ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV).\n    *   λ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm\n\n2.  **Determine the Color of Emitted Light:** A wavelength of approximately 530 nm falls within the green portion of the visible light spectrum. So, the textile dye emits green light, a phenomenon known as fluorescence.\n\n3.  **Relate Emitted Color to Absorbed Color:** The color an object appears is determined by the wavelengths of light it reflects or transmits, which are complementary to the wavelengths it absorbs. For a substance to emit light (fluoresce), it must first absorb light. Due to energy losses, the emitted light always has a lower energy (and thus a longer wavelength) than the absorbed light. This is known as Stokes' Law.\n\n4.  **Identify the Absorbed Color:** Since the dye emits green light (≈530 nm), it must absorb light of a shorter wavelength and higher energy. Looking at the visible spectrum, colors with wavelengths shorter than green light include blue and violet.\n    *   Green light has an energy of ~2.3 eV.\n    *   Yellow light has a lower energy (~2.1 eV).\n    *   Red light has an even lower energy (~1.9 eV).\n    *   Blue light has a higher energy (~2.6 eV).\n    *   Violet light has the highest energy (~3.0 eV).\n\n    Based on the principle that absorbed energy must be greater than emitted energy, both blue and violet are possible candidates. However, the question asks for the color that is absorbed. Dyes appear as the complementary color of the light they absorb most strongly. A substance that absorbs blue light appears yellow or orange. Given that the compound is a dye with extensive pi-electron conjugation, it has a strong absorption band. The emission at 530 nm (green) suggests a strong absorption at a shorter wavelength, with blue being the most probable region to induce this fluorescence. Therefore, the dye absorbs blue light.\n\n<<<B>>>"
