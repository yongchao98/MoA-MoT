    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n**1. Identify the relevant principles and formulas:**\n\n*   The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle connects the uncertainty in a particle's position (Δx) and its momentum (Δp). The relationship is given by:\n    Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s). For estimations, this is often approximated as Δx ⋅ Δp ≈ ħ.\n\n*   The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) can be related to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). For a particle with velocity v, the relationship is:\n    ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n    This relationship holds for both non-relativistic and relativistic cases.\n\n**2. Combine the formulas:**\n\nFirst, we can find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp) from the uncertainty in position (Δx):\nΔp ≈ ħ / Δx\n\nNext, substitute this into the energy uncertainty equation:\nΔE ≈ v ⋅ (ħ / Δx)\n\n**3. List the given values:**\n\n*   Velocity (v) = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   Uncertainty in position (Δx) = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\n**4. Calculate the uncertainty in energy:**\n\nNow, plug the values into the combined formula:\n\nΔE ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (10⁻¹⁰ m)\n\nΔE ≈ (2.108 x 10⁻²⁶ J·m) / (10⁻¹⁰ m)\n\nΔE ≈ 2.108 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n**5. Compare with the given options:**\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 2.108 x 10⁻¹⁶ J. This is on the order of magnitude of 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n*   A) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n*   B) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n*   C) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n*   D) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
