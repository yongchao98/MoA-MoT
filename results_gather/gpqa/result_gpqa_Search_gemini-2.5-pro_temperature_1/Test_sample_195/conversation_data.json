    "To determine the maximum speed of the 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator, we can use the principle of conservation of energy. The total energy of the system, which is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the potential energy of the spring, must remain constant throughout the oscillation.\n\n1.  **Define the total energy:**\n    The total energy (E_total) of the system at any point is the sum of the relativistic energy of the mass and the potential energy (U) stored in the spring.\n    The relativistic energy of a particle with rest mass 'm' and speed 'v' is `γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    The potential energy stored in the spring due to Hooke's law at a displacement 'x' is `U = (1/2)kx²`.\n    Therefore, the total energy of the system is:\n    `E_total = γmc² + (1/2)kx²`\n\n2.  **Energy at maximum displacement (x = A):**\n    At the maximum amplitude `A`, the mass momentarily stops, so its speed `v` is 0.\n    When `v = 0`, the Lorentz factor `γ = 1`.\n    The potential energy is at its maximum: `U_max = (1/2)kA²`.\n    So, the total energy of the system at this point is:\n    `E_total = (1)mc² + (1/2)kA²`\n\n3.  **Energy at the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n    At the equilibrium position, the potential energy stored in the spring is zero (`U = 0`).\n    The speed of the mass is at its maximum, `v = v_max`.\n    The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value, `γ_max = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)`.\n    So, the total energy of the system at this point is:\n    `E_total = γ_max * mc² + 0`\n\n4.  **Apply the conservation of energy:**\n    Since the total energy of the system is conserved, we can equate the energy expressions from steps 2 and 3:\n    `mc² + (1/2)kA² = γ_max * mc²`\n\n5.  **Solve for v_max:**\n    First, solve for `γ_max`:\n    `γ_max = (mc² + (1/2)kA²) / mc²`\n    `γ_max = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of `γ_max`:\n    `1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n\n    Square both sides of the equation:\n    `1 / (1 - v_max²/c²) = (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²`\n\n    Rearrange to solve for `v_max`:\n    `1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²`\n    `v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²`\n    `v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²)`\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
