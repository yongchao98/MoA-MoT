    "The search results confirm the formulas I used.\n\n1.  **Transit Probability:** The geometric probability of a transit for a planet in a circular orbit is `P_transit = R_star / a`, where `R_star` is the stellar radius and `a` is the semi-major axis. The more precise formula `P_transit = (R_star + R_planet) / a` is also mentioned, but since the planets are Earth-like and thus much smaller than their host stars, the `R_planet` term is negligible and can be ignored for this comparative calculation.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The relationship between orbital period (P), semi-major axis (a), and stellar mass (M_star) is given by `P² ∝ a³ / M_star`. This can be rearranged to solve for the semi-major axis: `a³ ∝ M_star * P²`, which means `a ∝ (M_star * P²)^(1/3)`. The planet's mass can be considered negligible compared to the star's mass.\n\nMy derivation of the probability ratio was:\n`Ratio = ( (M2 * P2^2) / ( (2 * M2) * (P2 / 3)^2 ) )^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = ( 1 / (2/9) )^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = (9/2)^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = 4.5^(1/3)`\n`Ratio ≈ 1.65`\n\nThe calculation seems solid and is based on fundamental principles confirmed by the search results. Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting by a factor of approximately 1.65. This corresponds to option B.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n*   Identify the formula for transit probability: `P_transit ∝ R_star / a`. Correct.\n*   Identify the formula for the semi-major axis from Kepler's Third Law: `a ∝ (M_star * P^2)^(1/3)`. Correct.\n*   Substitute 'a' into the probability formula: `P_transit ∝ R_star / (M_star * P^2)^(1/3)`. Correct.\n*   Set up the ratio `Prob1 / Prob2`: `(R1 * M1^(-1/3) * P1^(-2/3)) / (R2 * M2^(-1/3) * P2^(-2/3))`. Correct.\n*   Substitute the given relationships: `R1 = R2`, `M1 = 2 * M2`, `P1 = P2 / 3`. Correct.\n*   Algebraic simplification:\n    `Ratio = (R2 * (2*M2)^(-1/3) * (P2/3)^(-2/3)) / (R2 * M2^(-1/3) * P2^(-2/3))`\n    `Ratio = 2^(-1/3) * (1/3)^(-2/3)`\n    `Ratio = 2^(-1/3) * 3^(2/3)`\n    `Ratio = (3^2 / 2)^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = (9/2)^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = 4.5^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096...` Correct.\n\nThe result is robust. Planet_1 is preferred, and the probability is ~1.65 times higher. This matches option B.\n\nTo determine the correct choice, we must calculate the ratio of the transit probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2.\n\n1.  **Transit Probability Formula:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius (R_star) to the planet's semi-major axis (a).\n    *   `P_transit ∝ R_star / a`\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** To find the semi-major axis (a), we use Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital period (P), the semi-major axis, and the mass of the host star (M_star). The law states that `P²` is proportional to `a³ / M_star`. We can write this as:\n    *   `a³ ∝ M_star * P²`\n    *   Solving for `a`, we get: `a ∝ (M_star * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n3.  **Combining the Formulas:** By substituting the expression for `a` into the transit probability formula, we get:\n    *   `P_transit ∝ R_star / (M_star * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio of Probabilities:** Now, we can find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 (Prob1) to that of Planet_2 (Prob2).\n    *   `Ratio = Prob1 / Prob2 = [R_star1 / (M_star1 * P1²)^(1/3)] / [R_star2 / (M_star2 * P2²)^(1/3)]`\n\n5.  **Substituting the Given Values:** We are given the following relationships:\n    *   The stars have the same radii: `R_star1 = R_star2`\n    *   The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as the host of Planet_2: `M_star1 = 2 * M_star2`\n    *   The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P1 = P2 / 3`\n\n    Substituting these into the ratio equation:\n    *   `Ratio = [R_star2 / ((2 * M_star2) * (P2 / 3)²)^(1/3)] / [R_star2 / (M_star2 * P2²)^(1/3)]`\n\n6.  **Simplifying the Expression:** We can cancel out `R_star2`, `M_star2`, and `P2`.\n    *   `Ratio = (M_star2 * P2²)^(1/3) / ((2 * M_star2) * (P2² / 9))^(1/3)`\n    *   `Ratio = (M_star2 * P2²)^(1/3) / ( (2/9) * M_star2 * P2² )^(1/3)`\n    *   `Ratio = 1 / (2/9)^(1/3)`\n    *   `Ratio = (9/2)^(1/3)`\n    *   `Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   `Ratio ≈ 1.65`\n\nTherefore, Planet_1 has a transit probability that is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. This means Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\nTo determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we need to compare their transit probabilities. The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's semi-major axis.\n\nThe formula for transit probability (P_transit) is:\nP_transit ∝ R_star / a\n\nWhere:\n*   R_star is the radius of the host star.\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the semi-major axis (a) is related to the orbital period (P) and the mass of the host star (M_star) as follows:\na³ ∝ M_star * P²\nTherefore, a ∝ (M_star * P²)^(1/3)\n\nBy substituting 'a' in the transit probability formula, we get:\nP_transit ∝ R_star / (M_star * P²)^(1/3)\n\nNow, let's establish the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 (Prob1) to that of Planet_2 (Prob2).\n\nRatio = Prob1 / Prob2\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: P1 = P2 / 3.\n*   The mass of the star hosting Planet_1 is twice that of the star hosting Planet_2: M1 = 2 * M2.\n*   Both host stars have the same radii: R1 = R2.\n\nLet's plug these relationships into the probability formula for each planet and find the ratio:\n\nRatio = [R1 / (M1 * P1²)^(1/3)] / [R2 / (M2 * P2²)^(1/3)]\n\nSince R1 = R2, they cancel out:\n\nRatio = (M2 * P2²)^(1/3) / (M1 * P1²)^(1/3)\nRatio = ( (M2 * P2²) / (M1 * P1²) )^(1/3)\n\nNow, substitute M1 = 2 * M2 and P1 = P2 / 3:\n\nRatio = ( (M2 * P2²) / ((2 * M2) * (P2 / 3)²) )^(1/3)\nRatio = ( (M2 * P2²) / (2 * M2 * P2² / 9) )^(1/3)\n\nThe terms M2 and P2² cancel out:\n\nRatio = ( 1 / (2/9) )^(1/3)\nRatio = (9/2)^(1/3)\nRatio = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the cube root of 4.5:\n\nRatio ≈ 1.65\n\nThis means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
