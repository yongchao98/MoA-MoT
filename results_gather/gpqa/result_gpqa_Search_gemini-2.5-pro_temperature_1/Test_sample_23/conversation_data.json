    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z\n\n1.  **Composition**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This means the mass fraction of carbon is 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n2.  **Empirical Formula**: To find the empirical formula, we can assume a 100g sample. This gives us 14.28 g of Hydrogen (H) and 85.72 g of Carbon (C).\n    *   Moles of H = 14.28 g / 1.008 g/mol ≈ 14.17 mol\n    *   Moles of C = 85.72 g / 12.011 g/mol ≈ 7.14 mol\n    *   The simplest whole-number ratio of moles is C : H = 7.14 : 14.17 ≈ 1 : 2.\n    *   Therefore, the empirical formula of Z is CH₂.\n3.  **Molecular Formula**: Z is described as a saturated hydrocarbon that doesn't react further with hydrogen. A saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) has the formula CₙH₂ₙ₊₂, while a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) has the formula CₙH₂ₙ. The empirical formula CH₂ corresponds to the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. Thus, Z is a cycloalkane.\n4.  **Identification**: The problem states that hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. Mixture Y contains Z and another substance. This second substance in Y must hydrogenate to Z. Furthermore, mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which suggests its components are either saturated or aromatic. Since Z is saturated, the other component must be aromatic to be able to undergo hydrogenation under severe conditions. The hydrogenation of an aromatic compound like benzene (C₆H₆) produces a cycloalkane, cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n5.  **Confirmation**: Let's check if Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The molecular formula C₆H₁₂ fits the empirical formula CH₂ (n=6). The mass fraction of hydrogen in cyclohexane is (12 × 1.008) / (6 × 12.011 + 12 × 1.008) ≈ 14.37%, which is very close to the given 14.28%. Cyclohexane is also widely used as a solvent. Thus, we can confidently identify Z as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n\n1.  **Composition**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.\n2.  **Components**: We've established that one component is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must hydrogenate to cyclohexane under severe conditions and not react with bromine water. This strongly points to **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic and hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n3.  **Conclusion for Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X\n\n1.  **Reaction**: Mixture X, when heated with platinum, undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y. This means some molecules in X are reduced (gain hydrogen) while others are oxidized (lose hydrogen).\n    *   A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)\n2.  **Properties of X**: Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B. It decolorizes bromine water, indicating that A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds). The problem also states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X.\n3.  **Structure**: Since hydrogenation of mixture X yields only cyclohexane, both A and B must be C₆ hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring structure.\n4.  **Reaction Stoichiometry**: The reaction is a hydrogen transfer. Since the products (cyclohexane and benzene) are formed in an equimolar ratio, the reactants (A and B) must react in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   A (C₆Hₓ) + B (C₆Hᵧ) → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆\n    *   By balancing the hydrogen atoms: x + y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n5.  **Identifying A and B**: We need two unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds without conjugated bonds whose hydrogen counts sum to 18.\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: Contains one double bond and thus decolorizes bromine water. It has no conjugated bonds.\n    *   **Cyclohexadienes (C₆H₈)**: There are two main isomers: cyclohexa-1,3-diene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene has conjugated double bonds, so it is ruled out. **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)** has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds and will decolorize bromine water.\n6.  **Confirmation of Reaction**: Let's test if a mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene fits the description.\n    *   In the disproportionation reaction, cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈) is oxidized to benzene (C₆H₆), losing 2 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Simultaneously, cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) is reduced to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), gaining 2 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   C₆H₈ + C₆H₁₀ → C₆H₆ + C₆H₁₂. This is a known hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   The hydrogen atoms sum up: 8 + 10 = 18. This is consistent.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms\n\nThe two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈).\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid is:\n*   Hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene = 10\n*   Hydrogen atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene = 8\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"
