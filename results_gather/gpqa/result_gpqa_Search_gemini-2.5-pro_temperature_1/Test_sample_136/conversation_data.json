    "To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in the synchrocyclotron, we need to calculate the energy it gains with each turn and divide the final kinetic energy by this value.\n\nThe key parameters provided are:\n*   Final kinetic energy (T_final) = 950 MeV\n*   Peak accelerating voltage (U₀) = 190 kV\n*   Synchronous phase (Φ₀) = π/4\n*   Number of accelerations per revolution = 2\n\nIn a synchrocyclotron, the proton is accelerated twice per revolution, crossing an accelerating gap each time. The energy gained during each crossing depends on the voltage at that instant. The given voltage expression `U(t) = U₀ cos[2πν(α)t + Φ₀]` indicates that the acceleration occurs at a specific phase. The synchronous phase, Φ₀ = π/4, is the phase at which the proton repeatedly crosses the gap.\n\nThe energy gained in a single crossing is given by the charge of the proton (e) multiplied by the instantaneous voltage `U = U₀ cos(Φ₀)`.\n\nTherefore, the energy gain per crossing is:\n`ΔT_crossing = e * U₀ * cos(π/4)`\n\nSince there are two such accelerations per revolution, the total energy gained in one full turn is:\n`ΔT_rev = 2 * e * U₀ * cos(π/4)`\n\nLet's calculate this value:\n*   `e * U₀` is the energy gained if the voltage is at its peak, which is 190 keV (kilo-electron-volts).\n*   `cos(π/4) = √2 / 2 ≈ 0.7071`\n*   `ΔT_rev = 2 * 190 keV * (√2 / 2)`\n*   `ΔT_rev = 190 * √2 keV ≈ 268.7 keV`\n*   Converting to MeV: `ΔT_rev ≈ 0.2687 MeV`\n\nThe total number of revolutions (N) is the final kinetic energy divided by the energy gained per revolution:\n`N = T_final / ΔT_rev`\n`N = 950 MeV / (190 * √2 * 10⁻³ MeV)`\n`N = (950 * 10³) / (190 * √2)`\n`N = 5000 / √2`\n`N ≈ 5000 / 1.4142`\n`N ≈ 3535.5`\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the proton makes approximately 3536 revolutions.\n\n<<<D>>>"
