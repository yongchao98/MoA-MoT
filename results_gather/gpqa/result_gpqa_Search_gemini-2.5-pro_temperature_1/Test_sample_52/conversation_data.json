    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Data\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with two aromatic-H signals:** A benzene ring (C₆H₆) that is di-substituted has four protons remaining on the ring (C₆H₄). The presence of only two signals for these four protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents, the protons on opposite sides of the ring are chemically equivalent, leading to two distinct signals, typically appearing as two doublets.\n*   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) attached to another group with no protons (like the aromatic ring).\n    *   The vinyl proton adjacent to the ring is split only by the other vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet**.\n    *   The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a quartet). This combined splitting results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n*   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** One methyl group is from the propenyl (-CH=CH-**CH₃**) group identified above. The second methyl signal must come from the other substituent.\n*   **No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint that eliminates any structures containing a methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the FTIR Data\n\n*   **Absorption peaks indicating an ester group:** The FTIR data confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group. This group must also incorporate the second methyl group identified in the NMR. The two possibilities for an ester containing a methyl group but no methylene group are:\n    1.  A **methyl ester** group (-COOCH₃).\n    2.  An **acetate** group (-OCOCH₃).\n\n### 3. Assembling the Structure and Determining the Formula\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound consists of the following fragments:\n\n*   A **para-substituted benzene ring**: C₆H₄\n*   A **propenyl group**: -CH=CH-CH₃ (which has a formula of C₃H₅)\n*   An **ester group containing one methyl group**: This can be either -COOCH₃ or -OCOCH₃, both of which have a formula of C₂H₃O₂.\n\nCombining these fragments gives the total molecular formula:\n\nC₆H₄ (ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester part) = **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**\n\nThis formula corresponds to structures like (E)-Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate or 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate. Both of these structures are consistent with all the provided spectral data and have the same molecular formula. A search in chemical databases confirms that the molecular formula for (E)-Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate is indeed C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** This formula would require an additional CH₂ group compared to the derived formula, which is contradicted by the NMR data.\n*   **B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** This formula would require an additional carbon atom without additional hydrogens, which is inconsistent with the identified fragments.\n*   **C) C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** This formula perfectly matches the composition derived from the detailed analysis of the NMR and FTIR spectra.\n*   **D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** This formula has two extra hydrogens, which would imply the saturation of the propenyl double bond, but the NMR data clearly indicates the presence of vinyl protons.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>"
