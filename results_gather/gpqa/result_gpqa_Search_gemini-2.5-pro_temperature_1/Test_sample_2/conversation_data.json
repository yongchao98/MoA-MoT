    "To find the expectation value of the operator `10σz + 5σx`, we must calculate `⟨ψ| (10σz + 5σx) |ψ⟩` for the given spin state `|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩`.\n\nThe expectation value can be calculated as follows:\n`⟨O⟩ = ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`\n\nDue to the linear nature of the operator, this can be broken down into:\n`⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩`\n\nFirst, we define the state `|ψ⟩` and the Pauli matrices in the standard `σz` basis:\n*   The spin-up state `|↑⟩` is represented by the vector `[1, 0]T`.\n*   The spin-down state `|↓⟩` is represented by the vector `[0, 1]T`.\n*   The given state is `|ψ⟩ = 0.5[1, 0]T + (√3)/2[0, 1]T = [0.5, √3/2]T`.\n*   The corresponding bra vector is `⟨ψ| = [0.5, √3/2]`.\n*   The Pauli matrices are `σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]` and `σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the expectation value of σz.**\nThe expectation value `⟨σz⟩` is given by `⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩`.\n`⟨σz⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [0.5, √3/2]T`\n`⟨σz⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [0.5, -√3/2]T`\n`⟨σz⟩ = (0.5 * 0.5) + (√3/2 * -√3/2)`\n`⟨σz⟩ = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the expectation value of σx.**\nThe expectation value `⟨σx⟩` is given by `⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩`.\n`⟨σx⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [0.5, √3/2]T`\n`⟨σx⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5]T`\n`⟨σx⟩ = (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5)`\n`⟨σx⟩ = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2`\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results.**\nNow substitute the individual expectation values back into the combined expression:\n`⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)`\n`⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = -5 + 2.5√3`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final numerical value.**\nUsing the approximation `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n`⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732`\n`⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33`\n`⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ ≈ -0.67`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the value is -0.7.\n\n<<<A>>>"
