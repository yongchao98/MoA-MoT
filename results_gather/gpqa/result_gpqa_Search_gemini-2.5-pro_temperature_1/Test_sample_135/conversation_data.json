    "To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f**, denoted as ∫∇⋅**f** dV, over a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\n### 1. Define the Vector Field\nThe problem states that the vector field **f**(r) falls off radially as 1/r², and its only non-zero component is in the radial direction. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n**f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**\nwhere **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Divergence of the Field\nA direct calculation of the divergence (∇⋅**f**) in spherical coordinates for r ≠ 0 yields:\n∇⋅**f** = (1/r²) * ∂(r² * fᵣ)/∂r\nHere, fᵣ is the radial component of the field, which is 1/r².\n∇⋅**f** = (1/r²) * ∂(r² * (1/r²))/∂r = (1/r²) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0.\n\nThis calculation shows that the divergence is zero everywhere except possibly at the origin (r=0), where the field is singular (undefined).\n\n### 3. Apply the Divergence Theorem\nBecause of the singularity at the origin, simply integrating the divergence where it is zero will lead to an incorrect result of 0. The correct method is to use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux of the vector field through the closed surface bounding the volume:\n∫ᵥ (∇⋅**f**) dV = ∮ₛ (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n\nHere, V is the volume of the sphere of radius R, and S is its surface.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Surface Integral (Flux)\nThe surface element d**S** for a sphere of radius R is given by:\nd**S** = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**\n\nThe vector field **f** on the surface of the sphere (where r=R) is:\n**f**(R) = (1/R²) **r̂**\n\nNow, we compute the dot product **f** ⋅ d**S**:\n**f** ⋅ d**S** = [(1/R²) **r̂**] ⋅ [R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**]\nSince **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1 and the R² terms cancel out, this simplifies to:\n**f** ⋅ d**S** = sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nFinally, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for θ are 0 to π, and for φ are 0 to 2π:\n∮ₛ (**f** ⋅ d**S**) = ∫₀²ᵖ ∫₀ᵖ sin(θ) dθ dφ\n= ∫₀²ᵖ [-cos(θ)]₀ᵖ dφ\n= ∫₀²ᵖ [-cos(π) - (-cos(0))] dφ\n= ∫₀²ᵖ [-(-1) - (-1)] dφ\n= ∫₀²ᵖ (1 + 1) dφ\n= ∫₀²ᵖ 2 dφ\n= [2φ]₀²ᵖ = 2(2π) - 0 = 4π\n\nThe result of the integral is 4π. This non-zero result correctly accounts for the source (singularity) at the origin. The divergence of this specific field is technically described by the Dirac delta function, ∇⋅(**r̂**/r²) = 4πδ³(**r**), and its integral over any volume containing the origin is 4π.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 4 π\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 0\nD) 1\n\nThe calculated value is 4π.\n\n<<<A>>>"
