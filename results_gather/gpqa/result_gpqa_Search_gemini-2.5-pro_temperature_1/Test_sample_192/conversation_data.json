    "To determine how the number of stars changes with distance, we first need to understand the relationships between parallax, distance, and star counts.\n\n### Key Relationships:\n\n1.  **Parallax and Distance:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`) to a star. This fundamental relationship is expressed as:\n    `r ∝ 1/plx` or `d = 1/p` where `d` is the distance in parsecs and `p` is the parallax angle in arcseconds. This means that a smaller parallax corresponds to a greater distance.\n\n2.  **Given Information:** The problem states that the number of stars (`N`) observed varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This is typically interpreted as the cumulative number of stars with a parallax greater than a certain value `plx`.\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n### Deriving the Relationship with Distance:\n\nOur goal is to find how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance*, which can be represented as the derivative of the cumulative number of stars with respect to distance (dN/dr).\n\n1.  **Express Number of Stars in Terms of Distance:**\n    Since the number of stars `N` is proportional to `1/plx^5` and distance `r` is proportional to `1/plx`, we can substitute the distance relationship into the star count equation.\n    From `r ∝ 1/plx`, we have `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n    Substituting this into the given relationship for `N`:\n    `N ∝ 1/(1/r)^5`\n    This simplifies to:\n    `N ∝ r^5`\n    This means the total (cumulative) number of stars observed out to a distance `r` is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.\n\n2.  **Calculate Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    The question asks for how the number of stars *changes with distance* (per unit range of distance). This is asking for the density of stars as a function of radial distance, not the cumulative number. To find this, we differentiate the cumulative number of stars `N` with respect to the distance `r`.\n    Let `N(r) = k * r^5`, where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance is `dN/dr`.\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n    `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^4`\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`.\n\n`dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\nThis relationship shows that the number of stars within a thin shell at a distance `r` increases with the fourth power of that distance.\n\n<<<C>>>"
