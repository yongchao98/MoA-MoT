    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the relative speed and total energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nTo find the relative speed of the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let v1 be the velocity of the first astronaut (0.6 c) and v2 be the velocity of the second astronaut (0.5 c).\n\nThe formula for relative velocity is:\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c²)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7\nv_rel ≈ 0.1428c\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed **v_rel is approximately 0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Total Energy (E_total)\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The formula for the total relativistic energy of a particle is E = γmc², where 'γ' is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass 2m, velocity 0.6c):**\n*   First, calculate its Lorentz factor (γ1):\n    γ1 = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²)\n    γ1 = 1 / √(1 - 0.36)\n    γ1 = 1 / √(0.64)\n    γ1 = 1 / 0.8\n    γ1 = 1.25\n\n*   Next, calculate its total energy (E1):\n    E1 = γ1 * (2m) * c²\n    E1 = 1.25 * 2mc²\n    E1 = 2.5 mc²\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass 3m, velocity 0.5c):**\n*   First, calculate its Lorentz factor (γ2):\n    γ2 = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²)\n    γ2 = 1 / √(1 - 0.25)\n    γ2 = 1 / √(0.75)\n    γ2 ≈ 1 / 0.866\n    γ2 ≈ 1.1547\n\n*   Next, calculate its total energy (E2):\n    E2 = γ2 * (3m) * c²\n    E2 ≈ 1.1547 * 3mc²\n    E2 ≈ 3.4641 mc²\n\n**Total System Energy:**\n*   Now, add the energies of the two astronauts to find the total energy of the system:\n    E_total = E1 + E2\n    E_total ≈ 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc²\n    E_total ≈ 5.9641 mc²\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the **total energy E is approximately 5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c**, and the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc²**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
