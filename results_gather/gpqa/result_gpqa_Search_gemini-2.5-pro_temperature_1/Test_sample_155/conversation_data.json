    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatographic separations.\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation. This reaction is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. Starting with (E)-oct-4-ene (a *trans*-alkene), this results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is symmetrical, the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The epoxide is then treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is a ring-opening reaction where water acts as a nucleophile. The mechanism proceeds via *anti*-addition, meaning the water attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome.** The overall two-step process is equivalent to an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the starting alkene. An *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *trans*-alkene results in a single *meso* compound. In this case, the product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, which has a plane of symmetry and is achiral.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 1: One meso diol.**\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of mCPBA to (Z)-oct-4-ene (a *cis*-alkene) produces a *cis*-epoxide. Because the starting alkene is symmetrical, the resulting *cis*-4,5-epoxyoctane is a *meso* compound (it has an internal plane of symmetry).\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The *meso*-epoxide then undergoes *anti*-addition of water.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome.** An *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *cis*-alkene produces a racemic mixture of enantiomers. The attack of water on the *meso*-epoxide results in a 50:50 mixture of (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 2: A racemic mixture of two enantiomeric diols.**\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the single *meso* diol from Reaction 1 with the racemic mixture of two enantiomers from Reaction 2. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct chemical compounds (stereoisomers):\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (*meso* compound)\n*   (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer A)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer B)\n\nThe *meso* compound is a diastereomer of both enantiomer A and enantiomer B.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns use an achiral stationary phase. Such columns can separate compounds with different physical properties, like diastereomers.\n    *   However, enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The *meso*-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting enantiomers (racemic mixture).\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns use a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment.\n    *   This allows the column to distinguish between enantiomers, as they will interact differently with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n    *   A chiral column can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers in the mixture, showing **three peaks**:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The *meso*-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** One enantiomer (e.g., (4R,4R)-diol).\n        *   **Peak 3:** The other enantiomer (e.g., (4S,5S)-diol).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>"
