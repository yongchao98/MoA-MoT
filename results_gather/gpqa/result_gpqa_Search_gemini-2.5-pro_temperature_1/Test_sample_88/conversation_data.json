    "This multi-step synthesis problem requires a logical deduction of the reaction sequence, even though the initial spectral data for Product 1 appears inconsistent with the most plausible reaction pathway.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Product 1:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature. While the provided NMR data for Product 1 (especially the signal at 4.79 ppm) is unusual and does not readily match common adamantane derivatives, the subsequent reaction steps provide crucial clues. The most chemically sound transformation under these conditions that allows the rest of the sequence to proceed is a rearrangement to form **protoadamantan-4-one** (which is tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decan-4-one). This ketone has the correct formula C₁₀H₁₄O. We will proceed assuming this is Product 1.\n\n2.  **Product 2:** Product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts a ketone to an alcohol. Thus, protoadamantan-4-one is reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol. The problem states that this step is heated, and the next step involves ozonolysis, which cleaves a carbon-carbon double bond. This strongly implies that the alcohol formed undergoes dehydration (elimination of water) under the reaction conditions to form an alkene. The dehydration of protoadamantan-4-ol yields **protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). This alkene is Product 2.\n\n3.  **Product 3:** Product 2 (protoadamantene) is subjected to ozonolysis (O₃ followed by dimethylsulfide, DMS). This reaction cleaves the double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups. The ozonolysis of protoadamantene is known to cleave the C4=C10 double bond, opening one of the rings of the tetracyclic system to form a dicarbonyl compound. The resulting structure is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**. This is Product 3.\n\n**¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3:**\n\nWe need to determine the coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen atom in bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde, excluding the aldehyde protons themselves (which are the most deshielded overall at ~9-10 ppm but are excluded by the question's premise).\n\n*   The next most deshielded protons will be those on the carbons alpha to the electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups. These are the protons at the C3 and C7 positions (H3 and H7). By symmetry, H3 and H7 are chemically equivalent.\n*   Let's analyze the couplings for H3. It is a methine proton (CH) and is attached to a carbon that is part of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework, which typically adopts a chair-chair conformation.\n*   H3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, which are C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (CH₂) groups. Therefore, H3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n*   In the chair conformation, the H3 proton is typically in an axial position to minimize steric interactions with the aldehyde group. It will couple to two axial protons (one on C2, one on C4) and two equatorial protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n*   Axial-axial couplings (J_ax,ax) in six-membered rings are strong (typically 10-13 Hz).\n*   Axial-equatorial couplings (J_ax,eq) are weak (typically 2-5 Hz).\n*   Due to the molecule's symmetry and chair-like geometry, the two axial-axial couplings will be similar to each other, and the two axial-equatorial couplings will be similar to each other.\n*   Therefore, the H3 proton is coupled to two protons with a large coupling constant (J_ax,ax) and to two other protons with a small coupling constant (J_ax,eq).\n*   A proton coupled to two equivalent protons gives a triplet. When this is further coupled to another set of two equivalent protons with a different coupling constant, the resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
