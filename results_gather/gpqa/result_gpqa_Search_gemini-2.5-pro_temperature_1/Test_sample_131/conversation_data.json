    "To solve this problem, we must determine the expected 1H NMR spectra for each of the potential compounds and then see which 1:1 mixture matches the provided spectral data.\n\n### Analysis of Individual Compounds\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. The two aromatic protons are equivalent, as are the methyl groups at positions 1 and 4, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** Two singlets (6H each), creating a 1:1 ratio between them.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has no symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** Two distinct protons, resulting in two singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** In theory, four distinct methyl groups. However, accidental equivalence is common. Spectra show three signals for the methyl groups, with integrals in a 2:1:1 ratio (representing 6H, 3H, and 3H).\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** One singlet (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** The ethyl groups give a quartet (4H) and a triplet (6H). They are not singlets.\n\n### Evaluation of the Mixture in Each Option\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's assess the options:\n\n**A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n*   This mixture would show three aromatic signals and would have a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, which contradicts the given data.\n\n**B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n*   This mixture would produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene). This is inconsistent with the observation of only two aromatic signals.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n*   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene also gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, if these singlets have different chemical shifts, they will appear as two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the experimental data.\n*   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two 6H singlets. In a 1:1 mixture, this combination results in three singlets with integrals corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n*   This mixture would result in three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene), which contradicts the data.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only pair that fits the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
