    "Here is a step-by-step identification of compound E:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n\n*   Hint (a) describes a Wittig reaction between compound A and a phosphorus ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.\n*   A Wittig reaction converts a carbonyl group (C=O) into an alkene. The `(propan-2-ylidene)` part, which is `C=(CH₃)₂`, comes from the ylide.\n*   To find compound A, we reverse the reaction by replacing the `C=(CH₃)₂` group on the product with a `C=O` group. This gives us a 1,2-dimethylcyclopentane ring with a ketone group at position 4.\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbonyl carbon is given the lowest possible number, which is 1. Numbering the ring from the carbonyl, the methyl groups would be at positions 3 and 4.\n*   Therefore, **Compound A is 3,4-dimethylcyclopentanone**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Data from Hint (b)**\n\n*   The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm⁻¹. This frequency is characteristic of the C=O stretch in a five-membered ring ketone (cyclopentanone), which confirms the structure of compound A.\n*   The IR spectrum of compound E exhibits a strong peak around 1715 cm⁻¹. This frequency is characteristic of the C=O stretch in a six-membered ring ketone (cyclohexanone). This suggests that a ring expansion occurs during the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 3: Trace the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **A → B:** Compound A (3,4-dimethylcyclopentanone) reacts with HCN. This is a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group, forming a cyanohydrin. **Compound B is 1-cyano-3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol**.\n*   **B → C:** The cyanohydrin (B) is reduced with H₂/Pd. This reaction reduces the nitrile group (-C≡N) to a primary amine (-CH₂NH₂). **Compound C is 1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol**.\n*   **C → D:** The primary amine (C) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂) to form an unstable diazonium salt. **Compound D is the [(1-hydroxy-3,4-dimethylcyclopentyl)methyl]diazonium ion**.\n*   **D → E:** The diazonium salt (D) spontaneously loses nitrogen gas (N₂), an inert gas, to form a primary carbocation. This intermediate undergoes a ring expansion known as the **Tiffeneau–Demjanov rearrangement**. In this reaction, a carbon from the cyclopentane ring migrates, expanding the five-membered ring into a more stable six-membered ring. The final product is a ketone.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Structure of Compound E**\n\n*   The Tiffeneau-Demjanov rearrangement of the intermediate derived from 3,4-dimethylcyclopentanone results in a one-carbon ring expansion.\n*   The cyclopentanone (A) is converted into a cyclohexanone (E).\n*   Tracing the positions of the methyl groups through the rearrangement, they end up on the newly formed cyclohexanone ring. Both possible migration pathways lead to the same product. When numbered according to IUPAC rules (giving the carbonyl carbon position 1 and the substituents the lowest possible locants), the product is **3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction sequence, particularly the Tiffeneau–Demjanov rearrangement, transforms 3,4-dimethylcyclopentanone (A) into 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one (E). This is consistent with the IR data, which shows a shift from a cyclopentanone peak (1750 cm⁻¹) to a cyclohexanone peak (1715 cm⁻¹). Therefore, compound E is 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n<<<C>>>"
