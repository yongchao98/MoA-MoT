    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we must first establish the instrument's capabilities and the visibility of the celestial objects from the Paranal Observatory. A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 is achieved in a one-hour exposure with a single 8.2-meter Very Large Telescope (VLT).\n\n### **1. ESPRESSO's Limiting Magnitude and Star Visibility**\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. This southern location dictates which stars are visible. An object's declination (celestial latitude) determines its visibility from a given observatory. For an object to be observable, it must rise sufficiently high above the horizon.\n\n*   **Polaris (the North Star)** has a declination of about +89 degrees. As it is located very near the north celestial pole, it is not visible from the Southern Hemisphere, including Paranal. Therefore, Polaris is not detectable with ESPRESSO at this location.\n\n*   **ESPRESSO's Performance:** In its 1-UT (single telescope) mode, ESPRESSO can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 in a one-hour exposure (three combined 20-minute exposures) for a star with an apparent V magnitude of 17.1. Therefore, any star with an apparent V magnitude brighter than or equal to 17.1 will be detectable under the specified conditions.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Each Star**\n\nWe will now evaluate each star based on its visibility from Paranal and its apparent V magnitude.\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Visibility:** Canopus has a declination of approximately -52 degrees, making it easily visible from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** It is the second brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent V magnitude of about -0.74.\n*   **Detectability:** Since -0.74 is significantly brighter than the limiting magnitude of 17.1, **Canopus is detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Visibility:** As established, with a declination of +89 degrees, Polaris is not visible from Paranal Observatory.\n*   **Detectability:** **Polaris is not detectable.**\n\n**c) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance.**\n*   **Visibility:** A declination of 0 degrees places this star on the celestial equator, making it visible from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):** Using the distance modulus formula, m = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5, where M is the absolute magnitude (15) and d is the distance in parsecs (10):\n    m = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5 * 1 - 5 = 15.0\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 15.0 is brighter than 17.1. Thus, **this star is detectable.**\n\n**d) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance.**\n*   **Visibility:** This star is visible from Paranal (Declination = 0 deg).\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):**\n    m = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 2.301 - 5 = 15 + 11.505 - 5 = 21.5\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 21.5 is fainter than 17.1. Therefore, **this star is not detectable.**\n\n**e) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance.**\n*   **Visibility:** This star is visible from Paranal (Declination = 0 deg).\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):**\n    m = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 - 5 = 15 + 3.495 - 5 = 13.5\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 13.5 is brighter than 17.1. Hence, **this star is detectable.**\n\n**f) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance.**\n*   **Visibility:** This star is visible from Paranal (Declination = 0 deg).\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):**\n    m = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.699 - 5 = 15 + 8.495 - 5 = 18.5\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 18.5 is fainter than 17.1. Consequently, **this star is not detectable.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, the following stars are detectable:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  Star (c) at 10 pc\n3.  Star (e) at 5 pc\n\nThe other three stars (Polaris, star at 200 pc, and star at 50 pc) are not detectable. Polaris is not visible, and the other two are too faint.\n\nTherefore, a total of 3 stars from the list would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph under the given conditions.\n\n<<<B>>>"
