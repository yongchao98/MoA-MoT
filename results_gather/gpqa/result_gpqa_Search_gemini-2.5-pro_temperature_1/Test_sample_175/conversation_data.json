    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Normalize the Initial State Vector**\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix:\n|ψ⟩ = `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\nFirst, we need to normalize this state vector. The norm squared of |ψ⟩ is:\n||ψ||² = ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n\nThe normalized state vector, |ψ'⟩, is:\n|ψ'⟩ = (1/√6) * `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\n**2. Measurement of Operator P**\n\nThe operator P is given by the matrix:\nP = `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\nWe need to find the probability of measuring the value 0 for P. This requires finding the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvalues of P:**\n    det(P - λI) = 0\n    -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ = -λ(λ²-1) = 0\n    The eigenvalues are λ = 0, 1, -1.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for eigenvalue λ = 0:**\n    P|p₀⟩ = 0 * |p₀⟩\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]` `[[x], [y], [z]]` = `[[0], [0], [0]]`\n    This gives the equations:\n    1.  y/√2 = 0  => y = 0\n    2.  x/√2 + z/√2 = 0 => x = -z\n\n    The un-normalized eigenvector is `[[1], [0], [-1]]`.\n    Normalizing this eigenvector: ||v||² = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2.\n    The normalized eigenvector |p₀⟩ corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 is:\n    |p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * `[[1], [0], [-1]]`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring P=0:**\n    The probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the eigenvector |p₀⟩ and the state |ψ'⟩.\n    Prob(P=0) = |⟨p₀|ψ'⟩|²\n    ⟨p₀|ψ'⟩ = [(1/√2), 0, -(1/√2)] * (1/√6) * `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n    ⟨p₀|ψ'⟩ = (1/√12) * [(1 * -1) + (0 * 2) + (-1 * 1)] = (1/√12) * (-2) = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3\n    Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3\n\n**3. State Collapse after Measuring P**\n\nAfter measuring P and obtaining the value 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector |p₀⟩.\nThe new state of the system is |ψ''⟩ = |p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * `[[1], [0], [-1]]`.\n\n**4. Measurement of Operator Q**\n\nThe operator Q is given by the matrix:\nQ = `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\nNow we measure Q on the new state |ψ''⟩ and find the probability of getting -1.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for eigenvalue λ = -1:**\n    Since Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1), and the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n    The normalized eigenvector |q₋₁⟩ corresponding to the eigenvalue -1 is:\n    |q₋₁⟩ = `[[0], [0], [1]]`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1:**\n    This probability is calculated on the collapsed state |ψ''⟩.\n    Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |⟨q₋₁|ψ''⟩|²\n    ⟨q₋₁|ψ''⟩ = * (1/√2) * `[[1], [0], [-1]]`\n    ⟨q₋₁|ψ''⟩ = (1/√2) * [(0 * 1) + (0 * 0) + (1 * -1)] = -1/√2\n    Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2\n\n**5. Calculate the Joint Probability**\n\nThe probability of getting 0 for P *and then* -1 for Q is the product of the two probabilities we calculated.\nProb(P=0 and Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)\nProb(P=0 and Q=-1) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
