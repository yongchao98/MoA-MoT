    "An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution can be approximated as an oscillating electric dipole, especially when considering the radiation in the far-field zone. The behavior of this radiation is described by fundamental principles of electromagnetism.\n\n### Angular Distribution of Radiated Power\n\nThe power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) from an oscillating electric dipole is not uniform in all directions. It depends on the angle θ relative to the axis of oscillation (the z-axis in this problem). The formula for the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle is:\n\n*dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)*\n\nThe maximum power, denoted as *A*, is radiated at the angle where sin²(θ) is maximum. The maximum value of sin(θ) is 1, which occurs at θ = 90°. Therefore, the maximum radiated power is proportional to sin²(90°) = 1.\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of θ = 30°, we calculate sin²(30°):\n\n*   sin(30°) = 1/2\n*   sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power *A* at this angle is the ratio of the power at 30° to the power at 90°, which is (1/4) / 1 = 1/4.\n\n### Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe power radiated by an oscillating dipole is also dependent on the frequency (ω) of the oscillation. Specifically, the total power radiated is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (P ∝ ω⁴). Since frequency and wavelength (λ) are inversely related (ω = 2πc/λ, where c is the speed of light), the power is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the wavelength.\n\n*P ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴*\n\nThis relationship, known as Rayleigh scattering, explains why shorter wavelengths are scattered more effectively than longer wavelengths.\n\nCombining these two findings:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power *A* radiated at θ = 30° is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form for the function *f*, which describes the radiated power, is proportional to **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
