    "To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes, we can use the Boltzmann equation. This equation describes the distribution of atoms over different energy levels for a system in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (N₂) to the number in a lower energy level (N₁) is given by:\n\n*R = N₂/N₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))*\n\nWhere:\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the energy levels (these are constant for the levels in question).\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant, approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe problem provides the temperatures of the star with and without spots, and the wavelength of the transition between the two energy levels, which allows us to calculate the energy difference ΔE.\n\n**1. Calculate the energy difference (ΔE):**\nThe energy difference is related to the wavelength (λ) of the transition by the formula:\n\n*ΔE = h * c / λ*\n\nWhere:\n*   h is the Planck constant, approximately 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n*   c is the speed of light, approximately 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s.\n*   λ is the wavelength, given as 1448 Å, which is 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ meters.\n\nPlugging in the values:\nΔE = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s) / (1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔE ≈ 1.372 x 10⁻¹⁸ J\n\n**2. Set up the ratio of the ratios:**\nWe need to find the factor by which the ratio changes, which is the ratio without spots (R_nospots) divided by the ratio with spots (R_spots).\n\n*   T_nospots = 6000 K\n*   T_spots = 5500 K\n\nFactor = R_nospots / R_spots = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\n\nThe term (g₂/g₁) cancels out, simplifying the equation to:\n\nFactor = exp[-ΔE/k * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots)]\n\n**3. Calculate the factor:**\nFirst, let's calculate the term ΔE/k:\n\nΔE/k = (1.372 x 10⁻¹⁸ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 99420 K\n\nNow, substitute the temperatures:\n\n1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots = 1/6000 - 1/5500 = (11 - 12) / 66000 = -1 / 66000 K⁻¹\n\nFinally, calculate the factor:\n\nFactor = exp[-99420 K * (-1 / 66000 K⁻¹)]\nFactor = exp(99420 / 66000)\nFactor = exp(1.506)\nFactor ≈ 4.508\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5. The information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage is not needed for this specific calculation, as the effective temperatures are directly provided.\n\n<<<D>>>"
