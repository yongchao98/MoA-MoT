    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻), we must first calculate the concentrations of the buffer components and the resulting hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] in the solution.\n\n### 1. Calculate Molar Amounts and Concentrations\n\nFirst, we determine the number of moles for each compound:\n*   **KH₂PO₄:** The molar mass is 136.09 g/mol.\n    Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol of H₂PO₄⁻\n*   **Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:** The molar mass is 177.99 g/mol.\n    Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol of HPO₄²⁻\n\nNext, we calculate the initial molar concentrations in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution:\n*   **[H₂PO₄⁻]** = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   **[HPO₄²⁻]** = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n### 2. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]\n\nThe solution is a buffer system composed of a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻). The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka₂.\n\nThe equilibrium is: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\nThe acid dissociation constant is Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n\nWe can find the [H⁺] by rearranging the Ka₂ expression:\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n### 3. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion [PO₄³⁻] Concentration\n\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻, which is governed by the third acid dissociation constant, Ka₃.\n\nThe equilibrium is: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\nThe acid dissociation constant is Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n\nWe can find the [PO₄³⁻] by rearranging the Ka₃ expression:\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nUsing the values calculated above:\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.235x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis value is closest to option D.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{6.24x10^{-7} M}}$.\n<<<D>>>"
