    "To determine the lower limit on the redshift of objects whose Lyman-alpha absorption line can be detected by optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider two key values: the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line and the shortest wavelength of light that can penetrate Earth's atmosphere to reach a ground-based telescope.\n\n1.  **Lyman-alpha Wavelength (λ_rest)**: This is a spectral line of neutral hydrogen in the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum. Its rest wavelength is approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å) or 121.6 nanometers.\n\n2.  **Atmospheric Cutoff (λ_observed)**: Earth's atmosphere absorbs most ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Ground-based optical telescopes can generally only detect wavelengths longer than about 3500-4000 Å because the ozone layer and other atmospheric components block shorter UV wavelengths. Therefore, for a spectral line to be detected from the ground, it must be redshifted to a wavelength longer than this atmospheric cutoff. We will use a value of ~3500 Å as the minimum observable wavelength.\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation**: The redshift (z) is the fractional change in wavelength due to the expansion of the universe. It is calculated with the formula:\n\n    z = (λ_observed - λ_rest) / λ_rest\n\n    To find the *lower limit* on the redshift, we use the shortest possible observed wavelength (the atmospheric cutoff) for λ_observed.\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    z = (3500 Å - 1216 Å) / 1216 Å\n    z = 2284 Å / 1216 Å\n    z ≈ 1.88\n\nThis calculated redshift of approximately 1.88 represents the minimum value required for the Lyman-alpha line to be shifted into the optical window accessible from the ground. Comparing this result with the given options, the value of 1.9 is the closest estimate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
