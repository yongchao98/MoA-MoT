    "The selection of appropriate reagents is crucial for the successful synthesis of target molecules in organic chemistry.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. It involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the carbonyl carbon of a ketone (butan-2-one).\n\n*   **Step 1:** The cyanide ion, provided by sodium cyanide (NaCN), attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n*   **Step 2:** An acid is required to protonate the negatively charged alkoxide intermediate to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin. Reagent **A** serves as this proton source. A hydronium ion (H₃O⁺), typically generated from a dilute mineral acid like HCl or H₂SO₄, is the appropriate reagent for this protonation step.\n\nTherefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\n*   This transformation can be catalyzed by either acid or base. The reaction is generally carried out by heating the nitrile with the hydrolyzing agent.\n*   In acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, the nitrile is heated under reflux with a dilute mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid. This process converts the nitrile directly into the carboxylic acid.\n\nTherefore, **B = HCl** is a suitable reagent for this conversion.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<A>>>"
