    "To identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2, we must analyze the given spectroscopic data step-by-step.\n\n### Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong bands are highly characteristic of the N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). Primary amines show two bands due to symmetric and asymmetric stretching, whereas secondary amines show only one.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The frequency is typical for an ester, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring, which shifts the absorption to a slightly lower wavenumber compared to a saturated ester.\n\nFrom the IR data, we can infer the presence of a primary amine (-NH2) and an ester group (-COO-).\n\n### Analysis of the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents three protons, and its triplet (t) splitting pattern indicates it is adjacent to a -CH2- group. This is characteristic of a methyl (-CH3) group that is part of an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal for two protons appears as a quartet (q), meaning it is adjacent to a -CH3 group. The significant downfield chemical shift (around 3.5-4.5 ppm) suggests the -CH2- group is bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom. Combined with the signal at 1.20 ppm, this confirms the presence of an ethyl ester group (-OCH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons is a classic signal for the hydrogens of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to factors like quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange. This supports the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets (d) in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The upfield shift to 7.0 ppm is caused by an electron-donating group (the -NH2 group), while the downfield shift to 8.0 ppm is caused by an electron-withdrawing group (the -COOCH2CH3 group).\n\n### Structure Determination\n\nCombining all the pieces of evidence:\n1.  A primary amine group (-NH2).\n2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n3.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring to which these two groups are attached.\n\nThe structure that fits all these criteria is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The molecular formula C9H11NO2 is consistent with this structure. The spectral data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate from literature sources confirms these assignments.\n\nLet's review the other options:\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This would show a more complex pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR (not two doublets) due to meta-substitution. Also, the amide C=O stretch in the IR would typically be at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm-1).\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide and would show only one N-H peak in the IR spectrum. Its ¹H NMR would show a single N-H proton signal and a formyl proton signal.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This structure has a propionate group, not an ethyl ester attached to the ring. The NMR signal for the -CH2- group of the propionate would be a quartet around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not the 4.5 ppm observed, as it would be adjacent to the carbonyl carbon, not the ester oxygen.\n\nTherefore, the data conclusively identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
