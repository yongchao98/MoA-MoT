    "To determine the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same signal amplitude as the star's rotational modulation, we must first calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the starspots and then equate it to the transit depth of an exoplanet.\n\n### 1. Amplitude of Starspot Modulation\n\nThe brightness of the star varies as the spotted hemisphere rotates into and out of view. The amplitude of this variation can be expressed as the fractional change in flux relative to the maximum flux:\n\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\n*   **F_max** is the flux observed when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer.\n*   **F_min** is the flux observed when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer.\n\nThe flux emitted by a portion of the star's surface is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (T⁴).\n\nLet's model the observed flux based on the visible stellar disk:\n*   The flux at maximum brightness (unspotted view) is proportional to `T_eff⁴`.\n*   When the spotted hemisphere faces us, a fraction of the stellar disk is covered by spots. The problem states one hemisphere has a filling factor of 20%. In many astrophysical problems of this nature, this is interpreted as the fraction of the visible disk that appears spotted at the time of minimum brightness. Let's denote this disk filling factor as `f_d = 0.20`.\n*   The flux at minimum brightness is a combination of the flux from the normal photosphere and the cooler spots:\n    `F_min ∝ (1 - f_d) * T_eff⁴ + f_d * T_spot⁴`\n\nThe amplitude of the spot modulation is therefore:\n`Amplitude_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - [(1 - f_d) + f_d * (T_spot/T_eff)⁴]`\n`Amplitude_spot = f_d * (1 - (T_spot/T_eff)⁴)`\n\nGiven the values:\n*   `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   `ΔT = 1000 K`, so `T_spot = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K`\n*   `f_d = 0.20`\n\nFirst, calculate the ratio of the temperatures raised to the fourth power:\n`(T_spot/T_eff)⁴ = (5000/6000)⁴ = (5/6)⁴ = 625 / 1296 ≈ 0.4823`\n\nNow, substitute this into the amplitude equation:\n`Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (1 - 0.4823) = 0.20 * 0.5177 = 0.1035`\n\n### 2. Exoplanet Transit Depth\n\nThe problem asks for the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`R_pl`) that would produce the same amplitude signal if the star had no spots. The signal from an exoplanet transit is the dip in brightness caused by the planet blocking starlight. This transit depth is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\n`Amplitude_planet = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n### 3. Equating the Amplitudes\n\nTo find the required planet radius, we set the two amplitudes to be equal:\n\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude_spot`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.1035`\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius `(R_pl / R_star)` by taking the square root:\n\n`R_pl / R_star = √0.1035 ≈ 0.3217`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<C>>>"
