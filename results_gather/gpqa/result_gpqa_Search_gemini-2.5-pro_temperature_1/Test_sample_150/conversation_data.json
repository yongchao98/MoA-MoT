    "To calculate the probability that a measurement of the observable *P* will yield the value 0, we must follow the principles of quantum mechanics. The probability is found by projecting the system's state vector onto the eigenvector of the observable corresponding to the eigenvalue of interest.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the State Vector and the Observable Operator:**\n    The state of the system, `|ψ⟩`, is given by the column matrix:\n    ```\n    |ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]\n    ```\n    The observable, *P*, is represented by the matrix:\n    ```\n    P = [[0, 1/√2, 0],\n         [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],\n         [0, 1/√2, 0]]\n    ```\n\n2.  **Normalize the State Vector:**\n    First, we need to normalize the state vector `|ψ⟩`. The squared norm is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n    The normalized state vector, `|ψ_norm⟩`, is:\n    ```\n    |ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]\n    ```\n\n3.  **Find the Eigenvalues of the Observable P:**\n    The possible outcomes of the measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator *P*. We find these by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n    ```\n    det([[ -λ, 1/√2,   0   ],\n         [1/√2,  -λ,  1/√2],\n         [  0,  1/√2,  -λ   ]]) = 0\n    ```\n    This simplifies to `-λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ = λ(1 - λ²) = 0`.\n    The eigenvalues are `λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, and `λ = -1`.\n\n4.  **Find the Eigenvector for the Eigenvalue λ = 0:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0` by solving `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩ = 0`.\n    ```\n    [[0, 1/√2, 0],\n     [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],\n     [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z] = [0, 0, 0]\n    ```\n    This gives the equations `(1/√2)y = 0` (which means `y = 0`) and `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` (which means `x = -z`).\n    An unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 0, -1]`.\n\n5.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:**\n    The squared norm of this eigenvector is `1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`.\n    The normalized eigenvector `|v₀⟩` is:\n    ```\n    |v₀⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]\n    ```\n\n6.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    The probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product of the normalized state vector and the corresponding normalized eigenvector, `Prob(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n\n    The inner product is:\n    `⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]] . [(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]]`\n    `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)`\n    `= (1/√12) * (-2) = -2/√12 = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3`\n\n    The probability is the square of the magnitude of this value:\n    `Prob(0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\nTherefore, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t is 1/3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
