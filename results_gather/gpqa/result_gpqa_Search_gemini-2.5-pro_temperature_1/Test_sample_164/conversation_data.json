    "An evaluation of the four statements reveals the following:\n\n*   **A) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.** This statement is correct. The selective oligomerization of ethylene to form specific α-olefins, such as 1-hexene (from trimerization) or 1-octene (from tetramerization), is a key technology for producing linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) from a single ethylene feedstock. Catalysts based on chromium, a Group VIa (or Group 6) metal, are well-known and commercially used for this purpose. These chromium catalysts, often in specific oxidation states and with particular ligand systems, effectively convert ethylene into short α-olefins which can then be incorporated as regular branches into the main polymer chain.\n\n*   **B) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.** This statement is also correct. Major chemical companies in the US, such as Chevron Phillips Chemical and Univation Technologies, have developed and commercialized dual-catalyst or advanced single-catalyst systems that generate comonomers in-situ from ethylene. Processes like the UNIPOL™ PE process utilize these technologies to produce polyethylene with controlled branching in a single reactor.\n\n*   **C) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.** This statement is incorrect. The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization of ethylene. Aluminum-based activators, such as triethylaluminum (TEAl) and methylaluminoxane (MAO), are not only compatible but are often crucial for the activity of the oligomerization catalyst. In fact, an early industrial observation of in-situ comonomer generation was attributed to the presence of TEAl with a chromium catalyst.\n\n*   **D) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.** This statement is correct. Catalysts based on noble metals like palladium and rhodium have been shown to be active for the oligomerization of ethylene. However, the high cost and low abundance of these metals compared to first-row transition metals like chromium make them economically unviable for the large-scale production of commodity plastics like polyethylene.\n\nWhile statements A, B, and D are factually correct, statement A provides the most direct and fundamental chemical information about the type of catalyst system required to solve the scientist's specific problem—introducing regular branches by oligomerizing ethylene. It describes the identity of the key metallic element used in the industrially proven solution.\n\n<<<A>>>"
