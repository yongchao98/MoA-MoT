    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound and its corresponding 1H NMR data.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Molecular Information**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms (C₆H₄).\n*   **8 carbon atoms in total:** Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** The FTIR data confirms the presence of a C=O double bond. This must be part of one of the substituents.\n*   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** The FTIR data also indicates a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, or I) is bonded directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n### **2. Determine the Possible Structure**\n\nBased on the information above, we can deduce the two substituents on the benzene ring:\n1.  A **halogen atom** (–X).\n2.  A substituent containing **2 carbons and a carbonyl group**. The most common and stable arrangement for this is an **acetyl group** (–COCH₃).\n\nCombining these parts, the most likely molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The total formula would be C₈H₇XO, which is consistent with the requirements.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Substitution Pattern and Predict the NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe two substituents can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions. Let's consider the ¹H NMR spectrum for the most symmetrical and common arrangement, the **para (1,4) substitution**.\n\n*   **Structure:** 4-haloacetophenone (e.g., 4-chloroacetophenone).\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** Due to the para substitution, the four protons on the benzene ring are divided into two chemically equivalent sets. This typically results in two distinct signals, each appearing as a doublet and integrating to 2 protons. The protons closer to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be more deshielded and appear at a higher chemical shift (further downfield).\n*   **Substituent Protons:** The acetyl group (–COCH₃) has three equivalent protons on the methyl group. Since there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon, this signal will be a singlet, integrating to 3 protons.\n\nTherefore, the predicted ¹H NMR spectrum for 4-haloacetophenone is:\n*   A doublet for 2H in the aromatic region (~7.6-8.0 ppm).\n*   Another doublet for 2H in the aromatic region (~7.4-7.7 ppm).\n*   A singlet for 3H in the aliphatic region (~2.3-2.6 ppm).\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not a ketone. This option corresponds to (4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde. While this structure fits the carbon count and functional groups, the aldehyde (CHO) and adjacent methylene (CH₂) protons would typically split each other into a triplet and a doublet, respectively. The observation of two singlets is atypical.\n\n*   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the aromatic region (typically 7-8 ppm), so it cannot represent an aromatic compound.\n\n*   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches the prediction for 4-haloacetophenone. It shows the characteristic para-substituted aromatic pattern of two doublets for two protons each and a methyl singlet for three protons. The chemical shifts are well within the expected ranges.\n\n*   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only shows 1 aromatic proton, which is inconsistent.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe molecular formula, functional groups, and substitution pattern derived from the problem description point to 4-haloacetophenone. The ¹H NMR data in option C is the only one that correctly and unambiguously represents this structure.\n\n<<<C>>>"
