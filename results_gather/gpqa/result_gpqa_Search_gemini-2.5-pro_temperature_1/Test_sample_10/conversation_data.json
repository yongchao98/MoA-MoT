    "All of the provided statements regarding the molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2 are accurate, with the exception of one. After a thorough review of the scientific literature, the incorrect statement has been identified.\n\n**A) Correct:** Studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein can induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) by activating caspase-8. This activation occurs without altering the levels of Bcl-2, a key protein in the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptosis pathway. The activation of caspase-8 is a characteristic feature of the extrinsic, or death receptor-mediated, pathway of apoptosis, leading to the conclusion that ORF3a triggers apoptosis through this specific mechanism.\n\n**B) Correct:** Research on ribosomal frameshifting has established a linear correlation between the in vitro rate of frameshifting and the number of conformations the RNA pseudoknot can adopt. Under tension, which mimics the force exerted by the ribosome, the programmed -1 frameshift signals of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to adopt two main conformations. This is consistent with other pseudoknots that facilitate similar rates of frameshifting.\n\n**C) Correct:** Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is a crucial mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 that occurs near the 5' end of the viral genome at the junction of Open Reading Frame 1a (ORF1a) and ORF1b. This process involves the ribosome shifting back by one nucleotide (-1 frameshift) on a \"slippery sequence,\" which is facilitated by a downstream RNA pseudoknot structure. This allows for the production of two different polyproteins: pp1a (from ORF1a translation) and the larger pp1ab (when the frameshift occurs, bypassing the ORF1a stop codon). Structural and functional analyses have confirmed that the pseudoknots of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have essentially the same conformation and promote nearly identical rates of frameshifting.\n\n**D) Incorrect:** The SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14 complex does indeed operate as a heterodimer with a critical role in a mismatch repair mechanism, exhibiting 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) activity. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 binds to its cofactor nsp10 to form the active enzyme complex. However, the function of this complex is to *degrade* or *excise* mismatched nucleotides from the newly synthesized RNA strand, including from double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates, to ensure the fidelity of viral replication. The statement that the complex *prevents the breakdown of dsRNA* is contrary to its proven function as a nuclease, which is an enzyme that breaks down nucleic acids. Its role is to perform corrective degradation, not to prevent it.\n\n<<<D>>>"
