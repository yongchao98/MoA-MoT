    "To determine the time it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we need to use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n**1. Determine the Distance:**\nThe destination is Earth, and the journey starts from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The distance to the LMC from Earth is approximately 160,000 to 163,000 light-years. For the purpose of aligning with the given options, we will use a common approximation of 160,000 light-years for the distance (d).\n\n**2. Calculate Time in Earth's Reference Frame (Δt_earth):**\nThis is the time an observer on Earth would measure for the spacecraft's journey.\nTime = Distance / Speed\n*   Distance (d) = 160,000 light-years\n*   Speed (v) = 0.99999987 * c\n\nΔt_earth = 160,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c) ≈ 160,000.02 years\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\nThe Lorentz factor is a key component of time dilation and is calculated using the spacecraft's velocity.\nThe formula is: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   v/c = 0.99999987\n*   v²/c² = (0.99999987)² ≈ 0.99999974\n*   1 - v²/c² = 2.6 x 10⁻⁷\n*   √(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 0.0005099\n*   γ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1961.16\n\n**4. Calculate Time from the Astronaut's Perspective (Δt_astronaut):**\nThis is the proper time, the time experienced by the astronaut on the moving spacecraft. The time dilation equation relates the time in the stationary frame (Earth) to the proper time (astronaut).\nΔt_astronaut = Δt_earth / γ\n*   Δt_astronaut ≈ 160,000.02 years / 1961.16\n*   Δt_astronaut ≈ 81.58 years\n\nThe journey will take approximately 81.58 years from the astronaut's point of view.\n\n**5. Check for Survival:**\nThe astronaut is 22 years old at the start of the trip.\n*   Age upon arrival = 22 + 81.58 = 103.58 years\nThe average lifetime of these aliens is 150 years. Since 103.58 is less than 150, the astronaut will survive the journey.\n\nComparing the calculated time of ~81.6 years to the options provided, the closest answer is 81 years.\n\n<<<C>>>"
