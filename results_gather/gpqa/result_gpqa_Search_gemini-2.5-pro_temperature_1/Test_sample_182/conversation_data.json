    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first understand the reaction that takes place.\n\n### 1. The Reactant and Reagents\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n### 2. The Reaction\nThe combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is known for the complete reduction of various oxygen-containing functional groups to their corresponding alkanes. This includes:\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Ketones (>C=O) are reduced to methylene groups (>CH2).\n*   Alcohols (-OH) are reduced to hydrogens (-H).\nFurthermore, this reagent also reduces carbon-carbon double and triple bonds to single bonds.\n\n### 3. Structure and Formula of the Reactant\nLet's break down the reactant's name to determine its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between the 3rd and 4th carbon atoms.\n*   **-carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group, which we'll place at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl:** A -CHO group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl:** A -CH=CH2 group at position 5.\n\nThe molecular formula of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is C10H12O3.\n\n### 4. The Product\nThe reaction with red P and excess HI will reduce all the functional groups and double bonds:\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) becomes an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe carbon skeleton of the molecule remains, but all double bonds (C=C and C=O) are saturated, and all oxygen atoms are removed. The initial C10 molecule is converted into a C10 cycloalkane. A cycloalkane with a single ring has the general formula CnH2n. Therefore, the product has the molecular formula **C10H20**.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for IHD is:\n\nIHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n\nWhere:\n*   C is the number of carbon atoms.\n*   H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\n*   N is the number of nitrogen atoms.\n\nFor our product with the formula C10H20:\n*   C = 10\n*   H = 20\n*   N = 0\n\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 corresponds to the presence of a single ring in the now fully saturated molecule (an alkyl-substituted cyclohexane).\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
