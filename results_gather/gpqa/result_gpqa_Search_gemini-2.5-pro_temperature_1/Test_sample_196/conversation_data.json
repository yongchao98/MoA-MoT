    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of Compound X using the provided Infrared (IR) and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) data.\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The broad absorption in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range is a classic indicator of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) group, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond in an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   A broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H) is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The signals at 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H) are indicative of a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The remaining signals describe the alkyl substituent:\n        *   **0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H):** An ethyl group's -CH₃ part next to a -CH₂-.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃) next to a single proton (-CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** A methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** A methine group (-CH-) coupled to several neighboring protons.\n    *   Assembling the alkyl fragment reveals a *sec*-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n\nBased on this spectroscopic data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**2. The Reaction**\n\nCompound X is treated with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. The reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n*   **Reactant:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reagents:** Red P / HI\n*   **Transformation:** The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n\n**3. Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThe reduction of the carboxylic acid group on 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will yield a product where the -COOH is replaced by -CH₃, while the *sec*-butyl group and the benzene ring remain unchanged.\n\nThe final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect.\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - Correct.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect, the alkyl group is *sec*-butyl.\n*   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - Incorrect, this is the starting material.\n\n<<<B>>>"
