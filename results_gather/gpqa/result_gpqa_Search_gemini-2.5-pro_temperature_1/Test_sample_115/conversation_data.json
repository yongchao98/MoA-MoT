    "Here is a step-by-step identification of compound D:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n\n*   The proton NMR spectrum of compound A shows a triplet for 6 hydrogens (6H) and a quartet for 4 hydrogens (4H). This 3:2 proton ratio and the splitting pattern (triplet and quartet) are characteristic of ethyl groups (-CH2CH3).\n*   The presence of only two signals indicates a symmetrical molecule. n-Butane (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3) has a plane of symmetry, resulting in two equivalent methyl groups and two equivalent methylene groups. This gives a 6H signal for the two CH3 groups and a 4H signal for the two CH2 groups. The methyl protons are split into a triplet by the adjacent methylene group, and the methylene protons are split into a multiplet (often simplified as a quartet at an introductory level) by the adjacent methyl group. This perfectly matches the description of Compound A.\n*   Therefore, **Compound A is n-butane**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound B**\n\n*   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination to form Compound B. The free-radical bromination of n-butane can produce 1-bromobutane and 2-bromobutane.\n*   Due to the greater stability of the secondary free radical intermediate compared to the primary one, **Compound B, the major product, is 2-bromobutane**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound C**\n\n*   Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is an elimination (dehydrohalogenation) reaction.\n*   According to Zaitsev's rule, the major product is the more substituted (more stable) alkene. Elimination from 2-bromobutane can form but-1-ene (minor product) and but-2-ene (major product).\n*   The problem states that C has two geometrical isomers. But-2-ene exists as cis and trans isomers, while but-1-ene does not.\n*   Therefore, **Compound C is but-2-ene**, and the reaction proceeds using its *cis*-isomer.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Compound D**\n\n*   The *cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-but-2-ene) reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol in a Diels-Alder reaction to produce Compound D.\n*   **Reactants**:\n    *   Diene: (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol\n    *   Dienophile: *cis*-but-2-ene\n*   **Connectivity**: The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring. The product has a cyclohexene core with an alcohol group at C1 and methyl groups at C4, C5, and C6. The IUPAC name is 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol. This eliminates options A and B.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific; the stereochemistry of the reactants is retained in the product.\n    1.  Since the dienophile is *cis*-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups (which end up at C5 and C6) **must be cis** to each other in the final product.\n    2.  Let's analyze the stereochemistry of the options at C5 and C6. Option C is (...,5S,6R)-... and Option D is (...,5S,6S)-.... A detailed analysis of R/S configurations shows that a (5S, 6R) or (5R, 6S) designation corresponds to a *cis* relationship between the substituents, while a (5S, 6S) or (5R, 6R) designation corresponds to a *trans* relationship.\n    3.  Because the methyl groups at C5 and C6 must be *cis*, the configuration must be (5S, 6R) or (5R, 6S).\n    4.  Option D has a (5S, 6S) configuration, which implies the methyl groups are *trans*. This is inconsistent with the use of a *cis*-dienophile. Therefore, Option D is incorrect.\n    5.  Option C has a (5S, 6R) configuration, which is consistent with the required *cis* relationship of the methyl groups at C5 and C6.\n\nBased on this analysis, compound D must have the stereochemistry described in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
