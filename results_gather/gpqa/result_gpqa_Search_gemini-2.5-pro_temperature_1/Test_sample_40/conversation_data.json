    "The initial derivation was correct. The problem describes a scenario that is explained by the relativistic velocity-addition formula.\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The laboratory frame (observer's frame).\n    *   The rest frame of the glass, which is moving with velocity `v` relative to the laboratory.\n\n2.  **Identify the velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass relative to the lab is `v`.\n    *   The velocity of light within the glass, as measured in the rest frame of the glass, is `u'`. Since the refractive index of the glass is `n`, this velocity is `u' = c/n`. The problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum, `c`, as 1. Therefore, `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   The goal is to find the velocity of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, which we'll call `u`.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity-addition formula:**\n    The formula for adding collinear velocities in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    Substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the equation:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n) * v)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    To simplify the complex fraction, find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and the denominator.\n    *   Numerator: `1/n + v = (1 + nv) / n`\n    *   Denominator: `1 + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n\n    Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:\n    `u = [(1 + nv) / n] / [(n + v) / n]`\n\n    The `n` in the denominator of both fractions cancels out, leaving:\n    `u = (1 + nv) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches the formula derived by Max von Laue in 1907, who showed that the Fresnel dragging coefficient observed in the Fizeau experiment is a natural consequence of the relativistic velocity-addition formula.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nB) 1\nC) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\nD) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\nThe calculated speed matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
