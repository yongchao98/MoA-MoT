    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. It is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's distance (semi-major axis, 'a') from its star. The formula is T_eq ∝ 1/√a. This calculation assumes the planets are heated only by their star.\n\n2.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion describes the relationship between a planet's orbital period (P) and its semi-major axis (a). The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (P² ∝ a³). Therefore, the semi-major axis is proportional to the orbital period to the power of 2/3 (a ∝ P^(2/3)).\n\n3.  **Combine the Formulas:** By substituting the relationship from Kepler's Third Law into the equilibrium temperature formula, we can establish a direct relationship between equilibrium temperature and the orbital period:\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n    *   a ∝ P^(2/3)\n    *   Therefore, T_eq ∝ 1 / √(P^(2/3)) which simplifies to T_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2). Using the relationship derived above:\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Use the Given Orbital Period Ratios:** The problem states that the orbital periods of the five planets are in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n    *   The period of Planet_2 (P_2) is proportional to 2.\n    *   The period of Planet_4 (P_4) is proportional to 3.5.\n    *   The ratio P_2 / P_4 is therefore 2 / 3.5.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the period ratio into the temperature ratio equation:\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.83\n\nThe information that the planets have the same albedo, circular orbits, and were discovered by the TTV method confirms that the simplifying assumptions used in this calculation are appropriate for this system.\n\nThus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<B>>>"
