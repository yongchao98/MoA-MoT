    "The numerical value of \"a\" is determined by the normalization condition of the wave function. According to the Born rule in quantum mechanics, the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|², represents the probability density of finding the particle at a given position x. The total probability of finding the particle somewhere in the space where it can exist must be equal to 1.\n\nThe given wave function is Ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i. The probability density, |Ψ(x)|², is calculated as:\n|Ψ(x)|² = [Re(Ψ)]² + [Im(Ψ)]²\n|Ψ(x)|² = [a / sqrt(1 + x)]² + [-0.5]²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nThe problem states that particles are only found in the region between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral of the probability density over this interval must be equal to 1.\n\n∫¹³ |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n∫¹³ [a² / (1 + x) + 0.25] dx = 1\n\nNow, we solve the integral:\n[a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x] from 1 to 3 = 1\n\nEvaluating the integral at the limits:\n(a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3) - (a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1) = 1\n(a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25) = 1\na² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(b) - ln(c) = ln(b/c):\na² * ln(4/2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nFinally, we solve for \"a\":\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\na = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\nUsing the approximate value for the natural logarithm of 2 (ln(2) ≈ 0.693):\na ≈ sqrt(0.5 / 0.693)\na ≈ sqrt(0.7215)\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<D>>>"
