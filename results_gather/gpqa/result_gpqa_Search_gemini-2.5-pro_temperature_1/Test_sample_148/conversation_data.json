    "### Analysis of Observations\n\nHere is a breakdown of the experimental observations and what they imply, leading to the most probable conclusion.\n\n1.  **Â¹H NMR Data**: The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals that sum to one proton.\n    *   The presence of two peaks for the same proton indicates it exists in two different chemical environments.\n    *   Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, these two environments must belong to two different, but very similar, molecular species.\n    *   Enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images, are chemically identical in an achiral environment (like a standard NMR solvent) and therefore produce a single set of peaks. They cannot be distinguished by conventional NMR.\n    *   Diastereomers, which are stereoisomers that are not mirror images, are chemically distinct molecules with different physical properties. They will have different NMR spectra, and it is common for corresponding protons to appear as separate peaks with slightly different chemical shifts.\n\n2.  **LC-MS Data**: The analysis shows two distinct peaks of equal intensity that are separable by liquid chromatography (LC). Both peaks yield identical mass spectra, which match the expected molecular mass.\n    *   The identical mass spectra confirm that the two species are isomers of each other, not impurities like precursors or byproducts with different chemical formulas. This rules out option **A**.\n    *   The term \"double coupling\" is not standard, but if it implies the addition of an extra amino acid, the resulting molecule would have a significantly different (higher) mass. This is inconsistent with the mass spectrometry data, ruling out option **B**.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in achiral environments and will co-elute (appear as a single peak) on a standard, achiral LC column. They can only be separated using a specialized chiral column or by derivatizing them into diastereomers. Since the problem describes clear separation without mentioning a chiral column, it is highly unlikely the mixture consists of enantiomers, ruling out option **D**.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated on standard (achiral) LC columns. Therefore, observing two peaks is expected for a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe observation of two distinct species by both NMR and standard LC, coupled with the fact that they are isomers (same mass), strongly points to the presence of diastereomers. This is a common issue in chemical peptide synthesis, which can arise from two primary sources:\n\n*   **Racemization**: During the amide bond formation (coupling step), the chiral center of an amino acid can partially or fully lose its stereochemical integrity (racemize). If this partially racemized amino acid is then coupled to another chiral amino acid in the peptide chain, a mixture of diastereomers will be formed. For example, coupling L-Alanine to a racemic mixture of Phenylalanine would produce both L-Ala-L-Phe and L-Ala-D-Phe, which are diastereomers.\n*   **Rotamers/Atropisomers**: Some peptides, particularly those containing proline, can exist as stable *cis* and *trans* isomers around the peptide bond. These rotamers are a specific type of diastereomer and are known to interconvert slowly enough to give distinct signals in NMR and, in some cases, be separated by chromatography. Similarly, hindered rotation around other single bonds can lead to stable atropisomers, which are also a class of diastereomers that can be separated and give distinct NMR signals.\n\nBoth scenarios result in a mixture of diastereomers, which is fully consistent with all the analytical data provided.\n\n<<<C>>>"
