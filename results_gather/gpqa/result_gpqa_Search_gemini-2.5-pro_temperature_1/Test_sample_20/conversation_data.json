    "To determine the correct option, we must analyze the properties of each compound.\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. For keto-enol tautomerism, the most common form, a compound must typically possess an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** In the structure of 1,4-benzoquinone, the carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of a double bond and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. The other hydrogens are vinylic, meaning they are attached to carbons in a double bond. These are not readily mobile. Therefore, benzoquinone lacks the necessary α-hydrogens on a saturated carbon and does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound is in equilibrium with its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). The enol form is exceptionally stable because it is an aromatic ring, which is a highly favored energetic state. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily shows tautomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center – a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    2.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    3.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar around the central double bond and possesses a plane of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound **A** is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
