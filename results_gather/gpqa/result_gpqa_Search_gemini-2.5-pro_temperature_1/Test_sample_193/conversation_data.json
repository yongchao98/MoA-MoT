    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins (S1, S2, S3), where each spin can be +1 or -1, we must sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible 2³ = 8 configurations. The energy E is given by the equation E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\nFirst, we will list all eight possible spin configurations and then calculate the energy for each one.\n\nThe possible spin configurations are:\n1.  **All spins up:** (+1, +1, +1)\n2.  **Two spins up, one spin down:** (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1)\n3.  **One spin up, two spins down:** (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1)\n4.  **All spins down:** (-1, -1, -1)\n\nNext, we calculate the energy for each configuration:\n\n*   **For the configuration (+1, +1, +1):**\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n*   **For the three configurations with two spins up and one down (e.g., +1, +1, -1):**\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    The other two configurations in this category, (+1, -1, +1) and (-1, +1, +1), yield the same energy level of J.\n\n*   **For the three configurations with one spin up and two down (e.g., +1, -1, -1):**\n    E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    Similarly, the other two configurations, (-1, +1, -1) and (-1, -1, +1), also have an energy of J.\n\n*   **For the configuration (-1, -1, -1):**\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nFrom these calculations, we find two distinct energy levels and their degeneracies (the number of states with the same energy):\n\n*   An energy level of **-3J** has a degeneracy of **2** (the all up and all down configurations).\n*   An energy level of **J** has a degeneracy of **6** (the three states with two spins up and the three states with one spin up).\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states, which can be grouped by energy levels:\n\nZ = (degeneracy of E₁) * e^(-βE₁) + (degeneracy of E₂) * e^(-βE₂)\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\n\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
