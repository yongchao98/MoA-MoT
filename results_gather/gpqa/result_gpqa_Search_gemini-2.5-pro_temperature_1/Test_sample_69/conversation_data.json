    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify the mysterious substances and determine the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\n*   **Step 1: Analyzing the Hydrolysis Reaction**\n    The third reaction is the most revealing: the hydrolysis of C reforms the solid A and produces a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G). This suggests that C is a compound of A with at least one other element that forms both a strong and a weak acid upon reacting with water. A classic example of this is the hydrolysis of certain halides. For instance, the hydrolysis of a gold(III) chloride solution involves forming hydrochloric acid (HCl), a strong acid, and gold(III) hydroxide (Au(OH)₃), which is a weak acid. This makes Gold (Au) a strong candidate for A, gold(III) chloride (AuCl₃, which exists as the dimer Au₂Cl₆) a candidate for C, HCl for F, and Au(OH)₃ for G.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identifying the Reactants**\n    *   If **A is Gold (Au)**, a solid, and **C is Gold(III) chloride (Au₂Cl₆)**, a bright red solid, then gas **B** must be chlorine (Cl₂), as gold reacts with chlorine gas to form gold(III) chloride.\n    *   The reaction `A(s) + 8 B(g) → C(bright red)` presents a stoichiometric issue, as the actual reaction is `2Au + 3Cl₂ → Au₂Cl₆`. It is likely that the \"8 equivalents\" in the problem statement is a distractor or a typo.\n    *   Now let's examine the fourth reaction: `D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent)`. We've identified B as chlorine (Cl₂). A plausible reaction is with fluorine gas (F₂), another halogen, to produce chlorine monofluoride (ClF), an interhalogen compound that can be used as a solvent. So, **D is Fluorine (F₂)** and **H is Chlorine monofluoride (ClF)**. This reaction proceeds in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identifying the Hazardous Product E**\n    The second reaction is `C + 2 equivalents of D → E (extremely hazardous)`.\n    *   Substituting the identified substances: **Au₂Cl₆ (C) + F₂ (D) → E**.\n    *   Fluorine is a powerful oxidizing and fluorinating agent. It reacts with metal chlorides to displace the chlorine and form a metal fluoride and an interhalogen compound.\n    *   The reaction between gold(III) chloride and fluorine can produce gold(III) fluoride (AuF₃) and chlorine trifluoride (ClF₃).\n    *   Chlorine trifluoride (ClF₃) is known to be an extremely hazardous substance; it is a powerful oxidizing and fluorinating agent that is hypergolic with many materials, including living tissue. This makes **E = ClF₃**. The synthesis can occur from the direct reaction of chlorine and fluorine.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determining the Molecular Symmetry of E (ClF₃)**\n    To find the molecular symmetry group of Chlorine Trifluoride (ClF₃), we use VSEPR theory.\n    1.  The central atom is Chlorine (Cl), which has 7 valence electrons.\n    2.  It forms single bonds with three Fluorine (F) atoms.\n    3.  Total electrons around the central atom = 7 (from Cl) + 3 (from 3 F atoms) = 10 electrons, which equals 5 electron pairs.\n    4.  These 5 electron pairs arrange themselves in a trigonal bipyramidal electron geometry to minimize repulsion.\n    5.  Of these 5 pairs, 3 are bonding pairs and 2 are lone pairs.\n    6.  To minimize repulsion, the two lone pairs occupy the equatorial positions of the trigonal bipyramid.\n    7.  This arrangement results in the three Fluorine atoms and the Chlorine atom forming a \"T-shape\" for the molecular geometry.\n    8.  A T-shaped molecule possesses a C₂ axis of rotation and two perpendicular vertical planes of symmetry (σᵥ). These symmetry elements correspond to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nWhile another plausible hazardous product could be Xenon Tetrafluoride (XeF₄), belonging to the D₄h point group, the reaction sequence to form it does not align as well with the clues. Specifically, the hydrolysis of xenon fluorides does not produce a strong acid, and the starting material, Xenon, is a gas, not a solid like A.\n\nThus, the most consistent conclusion identifies E as ClF₃.\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (ClF₃) is **C₂ᵥ**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
