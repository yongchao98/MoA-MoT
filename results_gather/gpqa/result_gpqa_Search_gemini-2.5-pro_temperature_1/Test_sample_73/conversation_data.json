    "To solve this problem, we will use the principles of radioactive decay. A key concept is that radioactive decay is a memoryless process, meaning the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed.\n\n**1. Determine the decay constant (λ):**\n\nThe probability (P) of an atom surviving for a time (t) follows the exponential decay law:\nP(survival) = e^(-λt)\n\nThe probability of decay within time t is therefore:\nP(decay) = 1 - P(survival) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\nNow, we solve for the decay constant, λ:\ne^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-100λ) = 0.68\n-100λ = ln(0.68)\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\nλ ≈ 0.003857 min⁻¹\n\n**2. Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:**\n\nBecause radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not affect its future decay probability. We only need to calculate the probability of it decaying in the next 150-minute interval.\n\nUsing the decay probability formula with t = 150 minutes:\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nSubstitute the expression for λ we found earlier:\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^((-ln(0.68) / 100) * 150)\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))\nUsing the property of logarithms (a * ln(b) = ln(b^a)):\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))\nSince e^ln(x) = x:\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.68^1.5\n\nNow, we calculate the value:\n0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\nP(decay in 150 min) ≈ 1 - 0.5607\nP(decay in 150 min) ≈ 0.4393\n\n**3. Convert to a percentage and choose the correct option:**\n\nThe probability is approximately 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This value is closest to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
