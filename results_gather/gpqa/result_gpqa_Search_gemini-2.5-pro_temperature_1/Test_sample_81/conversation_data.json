    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Cyclooctatetraene with Maleic Anhydride → Product 1**\n\nCyclooctatetraene (COT) exists in a tub-like conformation. To participate in a Diels-Alder reaction, it must first undergo a valence tautomerization to its bicyclic isomer, bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene. This isomer contains a conjugated diene system within its six-membered ring, which can then react with a dienophile.\n\n*   **Diene:** Bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene\n*   **Dienophile:** Maleic anhydride\n\nThe reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition. Maleic anhydride is a *cis*-dienophile, and the reaction preferentially proceeds through an *endo* transition state due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. This is a general principle for Diels-Alder reactions. The maleic anhydride adds to the cyclohexadiene part of the molecule. The product, known as the \"Reppe Anhydride\", is a tetracyclic compound. This adduct has the *endo* stereochemistry.\n\n### **Step 2: Product 1 with Methanol and Sulfuric Acid → Product 2**\n\nThis step involves the reaction of the anhydride (Product 1) with methanol in the presence of an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The acid protonates a carbonyl oxygen of the anhydride, activating it for nucleophilic attack by methanol. This process opens the anhydride ring and, upon reacting with a second molecule of methanol, forms two methyl ester groups (-COOCH₃). This reaction converts the anhydride functional group into a dimethyl ester without altering the stereochemistry of the polycyclic carbon skeleton.\n\n### **Step 3: Product 2 with Cyclopentadiene → Product 3**\n\nThis is the final step, another Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n*   **Diene:** Cyclopentadiene\n*   **Dienophile:** Product 2\n\nProduct 2 has two double bonds that could potentially act as dienophiles: one in the six-membered ring and a strained double bond in the cyclobutene ring. Strained double bonds, such as those in cyclobutene, are highly reactive as dienophiles in Diels-Alder reactions. Therefore, the reaction will occur at the cyclobutene double bond. Cyclopentadiene is a cyclic diene that is locked in the required *s-cis* conformation for a Diels-Alder reaction.\n\nAs with the first Diels-Alder reaction, this cycloaddition will also favor the *endo* product for kinetic reasons. The cyclopentadiene will approach the cyclobutene double bond from the less sterically hindered face. The \"dienophile\" (the tetracyclic system of Product 2) is complex. The cyclopentadiene will add in such a way that its newly forming methylene bridge points *away* from the larger bulk of the existing molecule, leading to the thermodynamically more stable *exo* approach with respect to the diene, but the key stereochemical descriptor comes from the orientation of the substituents on the dienophile. In this complex case, analyzing the relative positions in the options is the most direct way to identify the major product resulting from the favored reaction pathway.\n\nBy carefully considering the stereochemical outcomes of these sequential Diels-Alder reactions (*endo* addition in both steps) and the Fischer esterification, we can determine the final structure. The consistent application of the *endo* rule leads to a specific set of relative stereochemical relationships in the final molecule. Comparing this predicted stereochemistry with the provided options, we find that option D matches the expected major isomer. The name and SMILES string in option D correspond to the product formed through the reaction pathway described.\n\nTherefore, the structure of the major isomer of product 3 is:\n\n**name: dimethyl (1R,4S,4aS,4bR,5R,8S,8aS,8bR,10R,11R)-1,4,4a,4b,5,8,8a,8b-octahydro-1,4-ethano-5,8-methanobiphenylene-10,11-dicarboxylate**\n\n**SMILES: O=C(OC)\\[C@@H]1\\[C@@H](C=C2)\\[C@@H]3\\[C@@H](\\[C@@H]4\\[C@H]3\\[C@H]5C=C\\[C@@H]4C5)\\[C@@H]2\\[C@H]1C(OC)=O**\n\n<<<D>>>"
