    "The potentials for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. They are derived directly from Maxwell's equations and represent the complete, relativistically correct, time-varying electromagnetic effect of a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($ \\vec{A} $) at an observation point $ \\vec{r} $ and time *t* depend on the properties of the charge at an earlier, *retarded time* ($t_r$). This is the time at which the field must have been generated to reach the observer at time *t*, traveling at the speed of light *c*.\n\nThe expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    This can be rewritten by factoring out c in the denominator as:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n*   **Vector Potential ($ \\vec{A} $):**\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    Similarly, this can be rewritten as:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nIn these expressions:\n*   $ \\vec{v} $ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $ \\vec{d} $ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $ \\vec{r} $.\n*   *d* is the magnitude of the vector $ \\vec{d} $.\n\nIt's important to note that all quantities describing the charge (its position, velocity, and the vector $\\vec{d}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The denominator term $ (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}) $ accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving charge.\n\nComparing these correct formulas with the given options, option B matches the derived expressions.\n\n<<<B>>>"
