    "The search results confirm the formulas and logic used.\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law (Ratio Form):** Several sources confirm that for two planets orbiting the same star, the ratio of the squares of their periods is equal to the ratio of the cubes of their semi-major axes: `(P2/P1)² = (a2/a1)³`.\n*   **Impact Parameter:** The sources define the impact parameter `b` as the projected distance between the center of the star and planet at mid-transit, normalized by the stellar radius. For a circular orbit, the formula is `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`. A transit occurs when `b` is less than a threshold. For the center of the planet to transit the star, `b` must be less than or equal to 1. An occultation (secondary eclipse) is guaranteed if a transit occurs in this edge-on geometry.\n*   **Limiting Condition:** The maximum orbital distance (and thus period) for a transit to occur corresponds to the maximum impact parameter, `b=1`.\n\nThe initial derivation stands as correct and well-supported. The steps are:\n1.  Express the ratio of the semi-major axes `a2/a1` in terms of the impact parameters `b2/b1`.\n2.  Set `b1 = 0.2` (given) and `b2 = 1` (the maximum value for a transit to occur).\n3.  Calculate the ratio `a2/a1 = 1 / 0.2 = 5`.\n4.  Use Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of the periods: `P2/P1 = (a2/a1)^(3/2) = 5^(1.5)`.\n5.  Calculate the final period: `P2 = 3 days * 5^(1.5) ≈ 33.54` days.\n\nThe answer is robustly ~33.5.\n\nFinal check of the question and options:\n*   Question: \"What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet... that will exhibit both transit and occultation events?\"\n*   Options: A) ~ 33.5, B) ~ 37.5, C) ~ 12.5, D) ~ 7.5\n*   My result `33.54` matches option A perfectly.\n\nThe information about the radii of the star and planets was not needed for the final calculation, as the relevant terms cancelled out. This is common in physics problems to test understanding of which variables are truly necessary.\n\nThe calculation is complete and verified. I am ready to provide the final answer.\nHere is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the Impact Parameter:** The impact parameter, *b*, for a planet in a circular orbit is the projected distance between the center of the planet and the center of the star at mid-transit, measured in units of the star's radius. The formula is:\n    *   b = (a ⋅ cos(i)) / Rₛ\n    *   where *a* is the semi-major axis of the orbit, *i* is the orbital inclination (the angle between our line of sight and the plane of the orbit), and Rₛ is the radius of the star.\n\n2.  **Use the Information for Planet 1:** We are given the following for the first planet:\n    *   Orbital period, P₁ = 3 days\n    *   Impact parameter, b₁ = 0.2\n    Let its semi-major axis be a₁. The equation for its impact parameter is:\n    *   0.2 = (a₁ ⋅ cos(i)) / Rₛ\n\n3.  **Establish the Condition for Planet 2:** We want to find the maximum orbital period for a second planet (P₂) to exhibit a transit. An occultation is a secondary eclipse where the planet goes behind the star; for a circular orbit, if a transit occurs, an occultation will also occur. The maximum orbital period corresponds to the maximum possible semi-major axis (a₂).\n    *   The maximum semi-major axis for a transit to occur is when the impact parameter, b₂, is at its maximum possible value.\n    *   For the center of the planet to pass in front of the star's disk, the impact parameter *b* must be less than or equal to 1. Therefore, the limiting (maximum) value for b₂ is 1.\n    *   b₂ = (a₂ ⋅ cos(i)) / Rₛ = 1\n\n4.  **Relate the Two Planets:** Since the planets are in the same orbital plane, they share the same inclination, *i*. The star's radius, Rₛ, is also the same for both calculations. We can set up a ratio of the two impact parameter equations:\n    *   (a₂ ⋅ cos(i) / Rₛ) / (a₁ ⋅ cos(i) / Rₛ) = b₂ / b₁\n    *   By canceling the common terms (cos(i) and Rₛ), we get a simple relationship between the semi-major axes and the impact parameters:\n    *   a₂ / a₁ = b₂ / b₁\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes:** Substitute the known and limiting values of the impact parameters:\n    *   a₂ / a₁ = 1 / 0.2 = 5\n    *   This means the maximum semi-major axis for the second planet is 5 times the semi-major axis of the first planet.\n\n6.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law states that for objects orbiting the same central body, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (P² ∝ a³). We can write this as a ratio:\n    *   (P₂ / P₁)² = (a₂ / a₁ )³\n\n7.  **Calculate the Maximum Period for Planet 2:** Substitute the values into Kepler's law and solve for P₂:\n    *   (P₂ / 3 days)² = (5)³\n    *   (P₂ / 3)² = 125\n    *   P₂ / 3 = √125\n    *   P₂ / 3 = 5√5\n    *   P₂ = 15√5 days\n\n    Now, we approximate the numerical value:\n    *   √5 ≈ 2.236\n    *   P₂ ≈ 15 × 2.236 ≈ 33.54 days\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet to show transit and occultation events is approximately 33.5 days. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
