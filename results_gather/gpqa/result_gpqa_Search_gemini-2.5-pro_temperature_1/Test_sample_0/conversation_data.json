    "To clearly resolve two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties, often called their natural linewidths. This relationship is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe formula for the energy-time uncertainty principle is:\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy (the linewidth).\n*   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nA quantum state that exists for only a short time cannot have a definite energy. The lifetime of the state (τ) can be used as the uncertainty in time (Δt). Therefore, the energy uncertainty (linewidth) of a state is inversely proportional to its lifetime.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy uncertainty (ΔE) for each state using the approximate relation ΔE ≈ ħ / τ:\n\n*   **For the first state (E1):**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For the second state (E2):**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo be clearly resolved, the energy difference between the two levels (|E1 - E2|) must be greater than the sum of their energy widths (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂).\n\n|E1 - E2| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n|E1 - E2| > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n|E1 - E2| > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n|E1 - E2| > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nNow, we compare this required minimum energy difference with the given options:\n\nA) 10⁻¹¹ eV\nB) 10⁻⁴ eV\nC) 10⁻⁸ eV\nD) 10⁻⁹ eV\n\nOnly option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, is significantly greater than the calculated minimum required separation of approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
