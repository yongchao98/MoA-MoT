    "The search results confirm my understanding of time dilation.\n\n*   **Time Dilation Formula**: The formula for time dilation is given as `t = t0 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`, where `t` is the time observed in the stationary reference frame and `t0` is the time in the moving observer's own frame of reference (rest time). This matches my formula `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n*   **Stationary vs. Moving Frame**: The \"clock\" in motion slows down as observed by a stationary observer. In this problem, the ejecta is the moving frame, and the Galaxy is the stationary frame. The time of 50 seconds is measured in the ejecta's frame, so it is the proper time (`t0` or `Δt₀`).\n*   **Calculation Process**: The problem asks for the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame. This requires calculating the time that has passed in the Galaxy's frame (`t` or `Δt`), which will be longer than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame. The distance is then this dilated time multiplied by the velocity.\n\nMy calculation steps are therefore correct.\n1.  **Given**:\n    *   Velocity (`v`) = 60,000 km/s\n    *   Proper time (`Δt₀`) = 50 s (time in the moving frame of the ejecta)\n    *   Speed of light (`c`) = 300,000 km/s\n2.  **Calculate `β = v/c`**:\n    *   `β = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`\n3.  **Calculate Lorentz factor `γ`**:\n    *   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n4.  **Calculate dilated time `Δt` in the Galaxy frame**:\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n5.  **Calculate distance `d` in the Galaxy frame**:\n    *   `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (50 / sqrt(0.96)) s`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nThis calculated value is closest to option A. The difference of ~1,862 km (or ~0.06%) is due to the rounding of the value in the provided option.\n\nI have confirmed the physics principles and the mathematical steps. The conclusion is robust.\n\nFinal check on the logic:\n- The question asks for a distance in the Galaxy frame.\n- `Distance = velocity × time`.\n- The velocity and time must be measured in the same frame (the Galaxy frame).\n- Velocity in Galaxy frame is given: 60,000 km/s.\n- Time in ejecta frame is given: 50 s.\n- To find the time in the Galaxy frame, we must use the time dilation formula, as clocks in the moving ejecta frame run slow compared to clocks in the Galaxy frame.\n- The time in the Galaxy frame will be longer than 50 s (`Δt = γ * 50s`, and `γ` is > 1).\n- Therefore the distance will be greater than the non-relativistic distance of `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This rules out options B, C, and D. Option A is the only one greater than 3,000,000 km.\n\nThis confirms the answer without even needing the exact calculation, just the understanding of the direction of the time dilation effect.\n\nThe calculation `d ≈ 3,061,862 km` confirms that A (`3,060,000 km`) is the intended answer.The problem involves the special theory of relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference.**\n    *   The \"stationary\" frame of reference is the Galaxy.\n    *   The \"moving\" frame of reference is the supernova ejecta.\n\n2.  **Identify the given variables.**\n    *   The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy (`v`) is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (`Δt₀`, also known as proper time) is 50 s.\n    *   The speed of light (`c`) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal.**\n    *   The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. To calculate this, we need to find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (`Δt`).\n\n4.  **Apply the time dilation formula.**\n    *   According to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object. The formula for time dilation is:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n        where `Δt` is the time in the stationary frame, `Δt₀` is the time in the moving frame, and `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light (`β = v/c`):\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n6.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt).**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n    *   This means that while 50 seconds have passed for an observer on the ejecta, about 51.031 seconds have passed for an observer in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n7.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame.**\n    *   The distance (`d`) is the velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time (`Δt`), both measured in the same (Galaxy) frame.\n        `d = v * Δt`\n        `d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s`\n        `d ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\n8.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    *   The calculated distance of approximately 3,061,860 km is very close to option A. The small difference is due to rounding in the intermediate steps.\n\nAlternatively, without an intermediate calculation, the distance is:\n`d = v * γ * Δt₀ = 60,000 * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 3,061,862 km.` This value is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\nA conceptual check also points to option A: due to time dilation, the time measured in the Galaxy frame is longer than 50 seconds. Therefore, the distance traveled must be greater than the non-relativistic calculation of `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. Option A is the only choice that is greater than 3,000,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>"
