    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the required volume of acid and the resulting pH of the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the moles of Fe(OH)₃\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = (Atomic mass of Fe) + 3 * (Atomic mass of O) + 3 * (Atomic mass of H)\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 g/mol + 3 * (16.00 g/mol) + 3 * (1.008 g/mol) = 106.869 g/mol.\n\nNext, calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the volume of strong acid needed\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid (represented by H⁺) follows this chemical reaction:\n**Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)**\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ ions to dissolve completely.\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed = 3 * 0.0009357 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol\n\nThe problem specifies a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid, which means the concentration of H⁺ is 0.1 mol/L. We can now calculate the minimum volume of this acid needed.\n*   Volume (L) = Moles / Concentration\n*   Volume (L) = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L\n\nTo convert this volume to cubic centimeters (cm³), we multiply by 1000.\n*   Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L = 28.07 cm³\n\nThis value is very close to 28.05 cm³ given in option D.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution\n\nAfter the Fe(OH)₃ dissolves, the resulting solution has a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L) and contains Fe³⁺ ions. The minimum amount of acid has been completely consumed in the reaction.\n\nThe concentration of the Fe³⁺ ions in the final solution is:\n*   [Fe³⁺] = Moles of Fe³⁺ / Total Volume\n*   [Fe³⁺] = 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.009357 M\n\nThe Fe³⁺ ion in water forms the hexaaquairon(III) complex ion, [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺, which is acidic because it can donate a proton (hydrolyze). The hydrolysis reaction is:\n**[Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)**\n\nTo find the pH, we need the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for this equilibrium. The Ka for [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ is approximately 6.0 x 10⁻³.\n\nNow, we set up an equilibrium expression:\nKa = [[Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺] [H₃O⁺] / [[Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺]\n\nLet 'x' be the concentration of H₃O⁺ at equilibrium.\n6.0 x 10⁻³ = (x)(x) / (0.009357 - x)\n\nSince the Ka value is relatively large compared to the initial concentration, we should solve the full quadratic equation:\nx² = 6.0 x 10⁻³ * (0.009357 - x)\nx² = 5.6142 x 10⁻⁵ - (6.0 x 10⁻³)x\nx² + (6.0 x 10⁻³)x - 5.6142 x 10⁻⁵ = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / 2a:\n*   a = 1\n*   b = 0.006\n*   c = -0.000056142\n\nx = [-0.006 ± sqrt((0.006)² - 4(1)(-0.000056142))] / 2\nx = [-0.006 ± sqrt(0.000036 + 0.000224568)] / 2\nx = [-0.006 ± sqrt(0.000260568)] / 2\nx = [-0.006 ± 0.01614] / 2\n\nSince concentration (x) must be positive, we take the positive root:\nx = (0.01014) / 2 = 0.00507 M\n[H₃O⁺] = 0.00507 M\n\nFinally, we can calculate the pH:\n*   pH = -log₁₀([H₃O⁺])\n*   pH = -log₁₀(0.00507) ≈ 2.29\n\nThis calculated pH of ~2.29 is closest to the pH of 2.04 from the options. The discrepancy may arise from using slightly different values for constants (molar mass, Ka) or rounding in the problem's intended solution. However, the calculated volume of 28.07 cm³ strongly matches the 28.05 cm³ in option D, and the calculated pH is in the same acidic range.\n\nGiven the choices, option D is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
