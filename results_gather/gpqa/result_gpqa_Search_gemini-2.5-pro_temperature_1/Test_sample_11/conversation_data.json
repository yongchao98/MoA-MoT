    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to find the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+).\n\nThe decay process is:\nPi(+) -> mu(+) + ν\n\nWhere:\n*   **Pi(+)** is the positive pion.\n*   **mu(+)** is the positive muon (an antimuon).\n*   **ν** is a muon neutrino.\n\n**Given:**\n*   The Pi(+) is stationary, meaning its initial momentum is zero and its initial kinetic energy is zero.\n*   Rest mass energy of Pi(+) (m_π * c²) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of mu(+) (m_μ * c²) = 105.7 MeV\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered massless for this calculation (m_ν * c² = 0), which is a standard approximation in this context.\n\n**Applying Conservation Laws:**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   **Before:** The total energy of the stationary pion is just its rest mass energy.\n        *   E_initial = m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV\n    *   **After:** The total energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν). The total energy for each particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy (KE).\n        *   E_μ = m_μ * c² + KE_μ\n        *   E_ν = KE_ν (since its rest mass is zero)\n        *   E_final = E_μ + E_ν\n    *   Therefore:\n        *   m_π * c² = (m_μ * c² + KE_μ) + KE_ν\n        *   139.6 MeV = E_μ + E_ν\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n    *   **Before:** Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero.\n        *   p_initial = 0\n    *   **After:** The muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum (p) for the total final momentum to be zero.\n        *   |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nWe can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m*c²)²\n\n1.  **For the neutrino (massless):**\n    *   E_ν² = (pc)² + 0\n    *   E_ν = pc\n\n2.  **For the muon:**\n    *   E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n\n3.  Now we can set up a system of equations. From the muon's equation, we can substitute `pc` with `E_ν`:\n    *   E_μ² = E_ν² + (m_μ * c²)²\n\n4.  From the conservation of energy, we know that `E_ν = m_π*c² - E_μ`. Substitute this into the equation above:\n    *   E_μ² = (m_π*c² - E_μ)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   E_μ² = (m_π*c²)² - 2(m_π*c²)E_μ + E_μ² + (m_μ * c²)²\n\n5.  Simplify the equation by canceling `E_μ²` from both sides and solve for the total energy of the muon (`E_μ`):\n    *   2(m_π*c²)E_μ = (m_π*c²)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   E_μ = [(m_π*c²)² + (m_μ * c²)²] / [2(m_π*c²)]\n\n6.  Plug in the given values:\n    *   E_μ = [(139.6)² + (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n    *   E_μ = [19488.16 + 11172.49] / 279.2\n    *   E_μ = 30660.65 / 279.2\n    *   E_μ ≈ 109.816 MeV\n\n7.  **Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ):**\n    *   KE_μ = E_μ - m_μ*c²\n    *   KE_μ = 109.816 MeV - 105.7 MeV\n    *   KE_μ = 4.116 MeV ≈ **4.12 MeV**.\n\n8.  **Calculate the energy of the neutrino (E_ν):**\n    *   From conservation of energy: E_ν = m_π*c² - E_μ\n    *   E_ν = 139.6 MeV - 109.816 MeV\n    *   E_ν = 29.784 MeV ≈ **29.8 MeV**.\n\n9.  **The kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_ν)** is equal to its total energy because it is considered massless.\n    *   KE_ν = E_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
