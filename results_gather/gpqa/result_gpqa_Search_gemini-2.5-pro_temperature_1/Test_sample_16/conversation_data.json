    "To determine the concentration of calcium ions in the solution, we need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe reaction for the formation of the Ca-EDTA complex (represented as CaY²⁻) is:\nCa²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ CaY²⁻\n\nThe formation constant, K_f (also given as K_Ca-EDTA), is the equilibrium constant for this reaction:\nK_f = [CaY²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n\nThe question asks for the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions in a solution that starts with 0.02 M of the complex, CaY²⁻. We can analyze the dissociation of this complex:\nCaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations:\n*   **Initial:** [CaY²⁻] = 0.02 M, [Ca²⁺] = 0 M, [Y⁴⁻] = 0 M\n*   **Change:** Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation. The change will be -x for CaY²⁻ and +x for both Ca²⁺ and Y⁴⁻.\n*   **Equilibrium:** [CaY²⁻] = 0.02 - x, [Ca²⁺] = x, [Y⁴⁻] = x\n\nNow, we plug these equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\nSince the formation constant (5 x 10¹⁰) is very large, the equilibrium strongly favors the complex, meaning the dissociation ('x') will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. This allows for a simplifying assumption:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the [Ca²⁺]:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx ≈ √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis calculated concentration of calcium ions matches option A. The problem assumes an \"ideal pH,\" which simplifies the calculation by allowing the use of the absolute formation constant without considering the pH-dependent protonation of EDTA.\n\n<<<A>>>"
