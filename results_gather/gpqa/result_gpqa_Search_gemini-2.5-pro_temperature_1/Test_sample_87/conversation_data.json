    "The experiment described involves delivering a viral antigen (rotavirus capsid protein) to the gut, leading to an immune response in the Peyer's patches, which are key secondary lymphoid organs in the intestine. The isolation of a *proliferating* cell population that shows *high variability* in the *variable heavy chain gene* points specifically to a process that occurs after B cells are activated by an antigen.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the options:\n\n*   **A) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process alters the constant region of the heavy chain, not the variable region. It changes the antibody's effector function (e.g., from IgM to IgA, which is common in the gut), but does not increase the variability of the antigen-binding site itself. While CSR is likely happening in the same germinal centers, it is not responsible for the observed variability in the variable region.\n\n*   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism that introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes in activated, proliferating B cells. This process takes place in germinal centers, specialized structures within secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. The purpose of SHM is to generate variants of the original B cell receptor, some of which will have a higher affinity for the antigen. This directly explains the \"high variability\" found in the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating cells.\n\n*   **C) VDJ recombination:** This is the initial genetic recombination process that assembles the variable region genes in *developing* B cells within the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ), *before* they encounter an antigen. It creates the primary B cell repertoire. The experiment, however, is observing a response in mature B cells in a secondary lymphoid organ following antigen stimulation.\n\n*   **D) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system, consisting of a cascade of plasma proteins that helps to eliminate pathogens. It is not a process of genetic modification within B cells and has no role in creating antibody gene variability.\n\nThe key events—antigen presentation in Peyer's patches, B cell proliferation, and high mutation rates in the variable region of the heavy chain gene—are the hallmarks of somatic hypermutation occurring within a germinal center reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
