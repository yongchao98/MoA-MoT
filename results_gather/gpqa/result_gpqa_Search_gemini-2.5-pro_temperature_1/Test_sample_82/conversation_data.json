    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Dilution\n\n*   **Initial Acetic Acid:** 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Dilution:** 20.00 cm³ of water is added.\n*   **Total Volume after Dilution:** 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L).\n*   **Initial Moles of Acetic Acid:** 0.0200 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol.\n*   **Concentration of Acetic Acid after Dilution:** 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M.\n\n### 2. Titration with NaOH\n\n*   **Titrant:** 0.1 M NaOH (a strong base).\n*   **Reaction:** CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n\n### 3. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   **pKa Calculation:** The acid dissociation constant (Ka) for acetic acid is 1.85x10⁻⁵.\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** The pH of a buffer solution can be calculated using this equation.\n    pH = pKa + log ( [Conjugate Base] / [Weak Acid] )\n*   **Ratio of Base to Acid:** At 25% titration, the ratio of [CH₃COO⁻] to [CH₃COOH] is 25/75, or 1/3.\n*   **pH Calculation:**\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.256\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n### 4. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion, which is a weak base.\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH to Reach Equivalence:**\n    Moles of Acid = Moles of Base\n    0.001 mol = (0.1 mol/L) * V_base\n    V_base = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total Volume at Equivalence:** 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ (0.050 L).\n*   **Concentration of Acetate (CH₃COO⁻):**\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n*   **Hydrolysis of Acetate:**\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   **Kb Calculation:** The relationship between Ka, Kb, and the ion-product constant for water (Kw = 1.0x10⁻¹⁴) is Ka * Kb = Kw.\n    Kb = (1.0x10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   **Calculating [OH⁻]:** We can set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis reaction.\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02)\n    x² = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **pOH and pH Calculation:**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nBased on these calculations, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<B>>>"
