    "To determine which of the described exoplanets has the highest density, we must analyze the physical principles that govern planetary density, particularly the effect of mass and composition.\n\nFirst, let's establish a baseline with the known densities of the planets in the options.\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is, by definition, a planet with the same characteristics as Earth. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is given directly as about 5.5 g/cm³, which is nearly identical to Earth's density.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** For planets with the same composition, mass plays a crucial role in determining density due to gravitational compression. A planet with less mass than Earth will experience weaker self-gravity, leading to less compression of its materials. Consequently, its density will be lower than Earth's.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This planet is a \"super-Earth\". Because it has the same composition as Earth, the primary difference affecting its density is its significantly greater mass. Gravity acting on the planet's mass compresses it, a phenomenon known as gravitational compression. The more massive a rocky planet is, the stronger its gravitational pull, and the more compressed its interior becomes, leading to a higher overall density. Therefore, a planet with five times Earth's mass but the same composition will be compressed to a much greater degree and will have a significantly higher density than Earth.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, the planet that is five times more massive than Earth (c) will be the densest. Its immense mass leads to strong gravitational compression, increasing its density far beyond that of the other planets listed.\n\n*   Planet (a) has a density of ~5.51 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (b) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (d) would have a density lower than 5.51 g/cm³ due to less mass and compression.\n*   Planet (c) would have a density significantly higher than 5.51 g/cm³ due to immense gravitational compression.\n\nThus, the planet described in option (c) has the highest density.\n\n<<<C>>>"
