    "The problem assumes a uniform distribution of stars in space. We want to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) depends on the parallax itself.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Uniform Star Distribution**: The number density of stars, ρ, is constant everywhere in space.\n\n2.  **Volume of a Spherical Shell**: Consider a thin spherical shell of space at a distance *d* from the observer, with a small thickness *dd*. The volume of this shell (*dV*) is its surface area (4πd²) multiplied by its thickness (*dd*):\n    dV = 4πd² * dd\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in the Shell**: With a uniform star density ρ, the number of stars (*dN*) in this thin shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n    dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² * dd\n\n4.  **Relating Distance to Parallax**: The parallax of a star (*plx*) is inversely proportional to its distance (*d*). For simplicity in astronomical units, this relationship is expressed as:\n    d = 1 / plx\n    This also means we can express the small change in distance, *dd*, in terms of a small change in parallax, *d(plx)*. By taking the derivative of *d* with respect to *plx*, we get:\n    dd / d(plx) = -1 / plx²\n    Therefore, dd = - (1 / plx²) * d(plx).\n    The negative sign simply indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars within a given range (a magnitude), we can use the absolute value: |dd| = (1 / plx²) * |d(plx)|.\n\n5.  **Substituting into the Star Count Equation**: Now, we substitute the expressions for *d* and *dd* in terms of *plx* back into our equation for the number of stars (*dN*):\n    dN = 4πρ * (1 / plx)² * (1 / plx²) * d(plx)\n    dN = 4πρ * (1 / plx⁴) * d(plx)\n\n6.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax**: The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the expression dN/d(plx). From the equation above, we can see this relationship:\n    dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴\n\nThis result shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. This relationship is a known result in stellar astronomy, often relevant when considering observational biases like the Lutz-Kelker bias.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx as ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<D>>>"
