    "The final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction:** A + H₂SO₄ → 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one\n\nThis reaction is a Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement, which involves the acid-catalyzed rearrangement of a 1,2-diol (a pinacol) to a ketone or aldehyde. The product is a cyclohexanone, a six-membered ring ketone. The formation of a six-membered ring from a five-membered ring via ring expansion is a common feature of this rearrangement.\n\nLet's examine the proposed starting material A from the correct option: **1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol**.\n\n1.  **Structure of Starting Material A:** This compound has a cyclopentane ring with a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl [-C(OH)(p-tolyl)₂] group on the same carbon (C1). This fits the definition of a 1,2-diol, as the two hydroxyl groups are on adjacent carbons.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Protonation and Carbocation Formation:** In the presence of a strong acid (H₂SO₄), one of the hydroxyl groups is protonated. Protonation of the exocyclic hydroxyl group (the one not directly on the ring) is favored because its departure as a water molecule forms a highly stable tertiary carbocation, stabilized by resonance with the two p-tolyl groups.\n    *   **Rearrangement and Ring Expansion:** The key step is the 1,2-shift. To relieve the ring strain of the five-membered ring and to stabilize the positive charge, a C-C bond from the cyclopentane ring migrates to the adjacent carbocation. This migration expands the five-membered ring into a more stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Formation of the Ketone:** The positive charge is transferred to the carbon atom of the original ring that bore the second hydroxyl group. This creates an oxonium ion, which is a resonance-stabilized carbocation and the conjugate acid of a ketone. Deprotonation of this intermediate yields the final ketone product.\n    *   **Product Structure:** The rearrangement results in a six-membered ring (cyclohexane). The ketone group (C=O) is at one carbon, and the adjacent carbon holds the two p-tolyl groups that were originally on the exocyclic carbon. This matches the product, **2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction:** methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H₂SO₄ → B\n\nThis is another Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement.\n\n1.  **Structure of Starting Material:** The starting material is `CH₃-CH(OH)-C(OH)(p-tolyl)-COOCH₃`. This is a 1,2-diol. C2 is a tertiary alcohol center, and C3 is a secondary alcohol center.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Protonation and Carbocation Formation:** The first step is the protonation of a hydroxyl group followed by the loss of water to form a carbocation. The most stable carbocation will form preferentially.\n        *   Loss of the -OH from C2 (tertiary) would form a tertiary carbocation stabilized by the adjacent p-tolyl group.\n        *   Loss of the -OH from C3 (secondary) would form a less stable secondary carbocation.\n    Therefore, the carbocation is most likely to form at C2.\n    *   **Rearrangement (Migratory Aptitude):** With the carbocation at C2, a group from the adjacent C3 must migrate. The groups on C3 are a hydrogen atom (-H) and a methyl group (-CH₃). The general order of migratory aptitude is Hydride > Phenyl > Alkyl. Thus, the hydride (H⁻) will migrate from C3 to C2.\n    *   **Formation of the Ketone:** The hydride shift transfers the positive charge to C3, which also bears the remaining hydroxyl group. This forms a protonated ketone. Deprotonation yields the final product.\n    *   **Product Structure (B):** The rearrangement results in a ketone group at C3 and the p-tolyl group remaining at C2. The structure is `CH₃-C(=O)-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH₃`. The IUPAC name for this product is **methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol**.\n*   Product **B** is **methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
