    "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis must be inactivated. This is often referred to as a \"gene knockout\". Analyzing the different types of mutations introduced in the mutant lines helps determine which is most likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n\n### Analysis of the Mutations:\n\nFirst, let's establish the reading frame of the intact gene. The sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the universal start codon for protein synthesis. The genetic code is read in triplets, or codons, from this point.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Codons & Amino Acids:**\n        *   `ATG` - Methionine (Start)\n        *   `TTT` - Phenylalanine\n        *   `CTC` - Leucine\n        *   `GCT` - Alanine\n\nNow let's examine the mutations:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The second codon `TTT` is changed to `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine, so this is a silent mutation.\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes a single amino acid. A missense mutation might alter or reduce the protein's function, but it does not guarantee complete inactivation.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon** (also known as a nonsense codon).\n    *   This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes translation to terminate prematurely, resulting in a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein. Introducing a premature stop codon is a common and effective strategy for creating a gene knockout.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   The sixth codon `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   This mutant has two **missense mutations**. While multiple amino acid changes increase the likelihood of disrupting protein function compared to a single change, it is still less certain to cause complete inactivation than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   This is a single **missense mutation**, similar to Mutant 1. It may or may not eliminate the protein's function.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe most effective mutation for eliminating the function of a gene is a nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon early in the coding sequence. This leads to a truncated protein that is highly unlikely to be functional. Mutant 2 is the only one with a nonsense mutation (`TAA`) at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon). The other mutants only have missense mutations, which substitute one amino acid for another and may not completely abolish the protein's activity. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable candidate to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
