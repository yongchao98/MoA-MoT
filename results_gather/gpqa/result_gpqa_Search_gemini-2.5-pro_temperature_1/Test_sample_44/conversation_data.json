    "This problem involves calculating the energy states of four identical spin-1/2 particles within a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Spin-1/2 particles are fermions and must adhere to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by the formula:\n`E_n = n^2 * (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)`\nwhere `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit `E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)`, simplifying the single-particle energy levels to `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n\nAccording to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles, one with spin up (+1/2) and one with spin down (-1/2).\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation for the required energy states:\n\n**Ground State:**\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   **n=1 level:** Can hold two particles. Their combined energy is `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n*   **n=2 level:** The remaining two particles occupy this level. Their combined energy is `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 8E`.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:** `2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n**First Excited State:**\nThe first excited state is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied level of the ground state to the lowest unoccupied level. In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2. The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   **Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n*   **Energy Calculation:**\n    *   Two particles in n=1: `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n    *   One particle in n=2: `1 * E_2 = 1 * (2^2 * E) = 4E`.\n    *   One particle in n=3: `1 * E_3 = 1 * (3^2 * E) = 9E`.\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:** `2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n**Second Excited State:**\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy above the first excited state. We must consider the possible promotions from the ground state:\n1.  **Promoting one particle from n=1 to n=3:**\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n    *   Energy: `(1^2*E) + 2*(2^2*E) + (3^2*E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n2.  **Promoting the second particle from n=2 to n=3:**\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy: `2*(1^2*E) + 2*(3^2*E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n3.  **Promoting one particle from n=2 to n=4:**\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n    *   Energy: `2*(1^2*E) + (2^2*E) + (4^2*E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\nComparing these possibilities, the lowest energy configuration after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy:** `18E`.\n\nTherefore, the energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<C>>>"
