    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to deduce the correct molecular formula from the given options.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad absorption in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid dimers.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the absorption range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n    *Conclusion from FTIR:* The unknown compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly bonded to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence confirms the conclusion from the FTIR data that the molecule contains an alkene functional group.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very diagnostic fragment. We need to calculate the mass of potential fragments.\n        *   Mass of Carbon (C) ≈ 12 amu\n        *   Mass of Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1 amu\n        *   Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16 amu\n        *   The fragment `[COOH]+` has a mass of 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu. The presence of a fragment with m/z = 45 is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid, which readily loses this fragment.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings and Evaluate the Options:**\n    The combined data indicates the unknown compound is an **alkenoic acid** (a molecule containing both an alkene and a carboxylic acid). Let's determine the requirements for such a molecule:\n    *   It must contain a -COOH group, so it needs at least **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   It must have degrees of unsaturation (DoU) to account for both the C=O bond (1 DoU) and the C=C bond (1 DoU). Therefore, it must have a total **DoU of at least 2**.\n\n    Now, let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation for each of the given formulas using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n\n    *   **A) C₆H₁₀O:**\n        *   Oxygens: 1. (Fails - cannot be a carboxylic acid)\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n\n    *   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n        *   Oxygens: 2. (Passes)\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. (Fails - not enough unsaturation for both a C=O and a C=C bond). This would be a saturated carboxylic acid like hexanoic acid.\n\n    *   **C) C₆H₁₂O:**\n        *   Oxygens: 1. (Fails - cannot be a carboxylic acid)\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n\n    *   **D) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n        *   Oxygens: 2. (Passes)\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. (Passes - this accounts perfectly for one C=O bond and one C=C bond).\n\n    Only the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** is consistent with all the spectral data, which indicate the presence of an alkenoic acid. An example of such a compound would be hexenoic acid.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a chemical formula C_x H_y O_z.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    # Extract numbers of atoms\n    C = int(re.search(r'C(\\d+)', formula).group(1))\n    H = int(re.search(r'H(\\d+)', formula).group(1))\n    O_match = re.search(r'O(\\d*)', formula)\n    # Handle cases with one oxygen (e.g., C6H10O) vs multiple (e.g., C6H10O2)\n    if O_match:\n        o_val = O_match.group(1)\n        O = int(o_val) if o_val else 1\n    else:\n        O = 0\n    \n    # Degree of Unsaturation formula for CxHyOz\n    dou = C - (H / 2) + 1\n    return int(dou), O\n\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"C6H10O\",\n    \"B\": \"C6H12O2\",\n    \"C\": \"C6H12O\",\n    \"D\": \"C6H10O2\"\n}\n\n# Spectral data conclusions:\n# - Need at least 2 Oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n# - Need at least 2 Degrees of Unsaturation (1 for C=O, 1 for C=C).\n\nprint(\"Analyzing options based on spectral data requirements (O>=2, DoU>=2):\")\nfor key, formula in options.items():\n    dou, oxygens = calculate_dou(formula)\n    print(f\"Option {key}) {formula}:\")\n    print(f\"  - Oxygen atoms: {oxygens}\")\n    print(f\"  - Degrees of Unsaturation: {dou}\")\n    if oxygens >= 2 and dou >= 2:\n        print(f\"  - Verdict: Matches all criteria.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"  - Verdict: Does not match all criteria.\")\n\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data:\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:** The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹, coupled with a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, is definitive evidence for a **carboxylic acid** functional group (-COOH). The additional peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (**alkene**, C=C).\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis:** The observation of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the existence of the C=C double bond.\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:** The fragment at m/z = 45 is a characteristic fragment for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the `[COOH]+` ion.\n4.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:** The molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and an alkene group (C=C), meaning it must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation**. A carboxylic acid also requires **two oxygen atoms**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options against these requirements:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O:** Has only 1 oxygen atom. Incorrect.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:** Has 2 oxygen atoms but only 1 degree of unsaturation (DoU = 6 - 12/2 + 1 = 1). This would be a saturated carboxylic acid, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR data showing a C=C bond. Incorrect.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O:** Has only 1 oxygen atom and 1 degree of unsaturation. Incorrect.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O₂:** Has 2 oxygen atoms and 2 degrees of unsaturation (DoU = 6 - 10/2 + 1 = 2). This formula perfectly accounts for a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group (an alkenoic acid). **Correct.**\n\nThus, the only formula that fits all the evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>"
