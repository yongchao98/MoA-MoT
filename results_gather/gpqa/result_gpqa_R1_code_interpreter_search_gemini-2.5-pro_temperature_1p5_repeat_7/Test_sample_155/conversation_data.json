    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks observed in each HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule due to a center of inversion.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process: 1) epoxidation with mCPBA, followed by 2) acid-catalyzed ring-opening (hydrolysis). This sequence results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the double bond.\n*   **Stereochemistry Principle:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a trans-alkene that is symmetrically substituted results in a **meso** compound.\n    *   `trans-alkene + anti-addition -> meso product`\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The product is meso-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral compound. Let's call it **Meso-diol**.\n    ```\n        HO   H\n          \\  |\n           C--C--OH\n          /  |\n    Pr---H   ---Pr   (showing one possible conformation)\n    ```\n    This molecule has two stereocenters, (4R, 5S), and possesses a center of inversion, making it achiral.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is an achiral molecule due to a plane of symmetry.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is the same: anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemistry Principle:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a cis-alkene that is symmetrically substituted results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   `cis-alkene + anti-addition -> racemic product`\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The products are (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers). They are produced in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture. Let's call them **(R,R)-diol** and **(S,S)-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **Meso-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(R,R)-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(S,S)-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the stereochemical relationships between these three compounds:\n*   **(R,R)-diol** and **(S,S)-diol** are **enantiomers**.\n*   **Meso-diol** is a **diastereomer** of both (R,R)-diol and (S,S)-diol.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe product mixture is analyzed on two different HPLC columns.\n\n**1. Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n*   This separation technique relies on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, such as (R,R)-diol and (S,S)-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a **single peak**.\n*   **Diastereomers**, such as the Meso-diol and the (R,R)/(S,S) pair, have different physical properties. They will be separated and elute at different times, appearing as **distinct peaks**.\n*   **Conclusion for standard HPLC:** We will observe two peaks. One peak for the Meso-diol and another peak for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair ((R,R)-diol + (S,S)-diol).\n*   **Total Peaks = 2**\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\n*   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase which creates a chiral environment.\n*   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, forming temporary diastereomeric complexes with different stabilities. This allows for the separation of **enantiomers**. Therefore, (R,R)-diol and (S,S)-diol will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n*   Diastereomers are also separated by chiral HPLC (as they are by achiral HPLC). Thus, the Meso-diol will elute at a different time from both the (R,R)-diol and the (S,S)-diol.\n*   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC:** All three stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks = 3**\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
