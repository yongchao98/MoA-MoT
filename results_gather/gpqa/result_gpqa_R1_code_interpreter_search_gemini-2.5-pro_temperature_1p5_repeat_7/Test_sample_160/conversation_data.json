    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve this problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions**\n\nFirst, we need to clearly define the two mean free paths mentioned in the problem:\n\n*   **λ1 (Lambda 1):** This is the mean free path of the *gas molecules themselves*. This value describes the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with *another gas molecule*. The formula for this is:\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n    *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas-gas collision. This is essentially the effective \"area\" that one molecule presents to another for a collision. It's related to the physical size of the molecules.\n    *   The `√2` factor accounts for the fact that both the \"projectile\" molecule and the \"target\" molecules are moving.\n\n*   **λ2 (Lambda 2):** This is the mean free path related to *electron scattering*. This value describes the average distance an electron from the beam travels before it scatters off a *gas molecule*. The formula for this is:\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron-gas collision. This is the effective \"area\" a gas molecule presents to a high-energy electron for a scattering event.\n    *   Note: The `√2` factor is not present here because the gas molecules are essentially stationary compared to the extremely high-velocity electrons (accelerated by 1000 kV).\n\n### **2. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to compare the two cross-sections: `σ_gg` and `σ_eg`.\n\n*   **Gas-Gas Cross-Section (σ_gg):** This is determined by the physical size of the molecules' electron clouds. Think of it as a \"billiard ball\" collision. When the electron clouds of two molecules get close enough, they repel and \"collide\".\n\n*   **Electron-Gas Cross-Section (σ_eg):** This is fundamentally different. The electron is a point-like particle, and it's moving at extremely high speed (relativistic speeds at 1000 kV). To this fast electron, an atom or molecule is mostly empty space. A scattering event only happens if the electron passes very close to the dense, positively charged nucleus or interacts with one of the orbital electrons. The probability of such a close encounter is low. Therefore, the effective target area for a high-energy electron (`σ_eg`) is **much smaller** than the kinetic cross-section between two whole molecules (`σ_gg`).\n\n    In summary: **σ_eg << σ_gg**\n\n### **3. Compare the Mean Free Paths (λ)**\n\nNow we can compare λ1 and λ2 using their formulas and our understanding of the cross-sections.\n\n*   λ1 is inversely proportional to σ_gg.\n*   λ2 is inversely proportional to σ_eg.\n\nSince `σ_eg` is much smaller than `σ_gg`, its inverse (`1/σ_eg`) will be much larger than the inverse of `σ_gg` (`1/σ_gg`). This means λ2 will be much larger than λ1.\n\nLet's look at the ratio to be more precise:\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n**λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\nSince we established that `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`, the ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a number much greater than 1.\nTherefore, the ratio `λ2 / λ1` must be much greater than √2 (which is approximately 1.414).\n\nOur conclusion is: **λ2 > 1.414 * λ1**\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's check which of the given options is consistent with our conclusion (`λ2 > 1.414 * λ1`):\n\n*   **A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1:** This statement is true. If λ2 is greater than 1.414 times λ1, it is certainly also greater than or equal to 1.22 times λ1.\n*   **B) λ2 < λ1:** This is false.\n*   **C) λ2 = λ1:** This is false.\n*   **D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1:** This is false. Our conclusion (`λ2 > 1.414 * λ1`) directly contradicts the upper limit in this option (`λ2 < 1.22*λ1`).\n\nTherefore, the only logically sound conclusion among the choices is A. The electron travels, on average, a much farther distance than a gas molecule before an interaction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
