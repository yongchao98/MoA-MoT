    "This problem asks for the best sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene in high yield.\n\nLet's first analyze the target molecule. The structure is:\n```\n      COCH3\n      /\n    (C1)\n   /   \\\n(C6)   (C2)\n|       |\n(C5)---(C4)---(C3)\n \\     /\n  NO2 Br\n```\nThe substituents are an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) at positions 1, 3, and 5, respectively. This is a meta, meta substitution pattern.\n\nWe need to evaluate the directing effects of these substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Electron-withdrawing, deactivating, and a meta-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly electron-withdrawing, strongly deactivating, and a meta-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Electron-withdrawing by induction but electron-donating by resonance, overall weakly deactivating, and an ortho, para-director.\n\nA critical rule for synthesis is that Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acylation) do not work on strongly deactivated benzene rings, such as those bearing a -NO2 group. They also fail with amines like aniline because the amine's lone pair coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3).\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline (reduction)\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride (diazotization)\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene (deamination)\nThe first four steps start with benzene and return to benzene, which is an inefficient and pointless sequence. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene. (-Br is an o,p-director).\n*   ii) Bromobenzene → A mixture of p-bromonitrobenzene (major) and o-bromonitrobenzene (minor).\n*   iii) Now, we attempt a Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on bromonitrobenzene. The presence of the strongly deactivating nitro group (-NO2) on the ring prevents the Friedel-Crafts reaction from occurring. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   iii) Now, we attempt a Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on aniline. This reaction fails because the nitrogen atom of the amino group acts as a Lewis base and coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a strongly deactivating ammonium salt (-NH2+-AlCl3), which shuts down the electrophilic substitution on the ring. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\nLet's analyze the sequence of reactions step-by-step.\n*   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.**\n    This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The product is acetophenone, which has an acetyl group (-COCH3) on the ring. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.**\n    The acetyl group directs the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. This gives 3-bromoacetophenone. Now we have an acetyl group at C1 and a bromo group at C3.\n\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.**\n    This is the crucial step. We are nitrating a ring with two substituents: -COCH3 (meta-director) at C1 and -Br (ortho,para-director) at C3.\n    *   The acetyl group directs the incoming -NO2 group to C5.\n    *   The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6.\n    At first glance, the directing effects seem to conflict. However, we must analyze the stability of the intermediate sigma complex (Wheland intermediate) for substitution at each possible position.\n    *   **Substitution at C5:** The positive charge in the intermediate is delocalized over C2, C4, and C6. None of these positions force the positive charge onto C1 or C3, which bear the electron-withdrawing groups. In fact, the resonance (+M) effect of the bromine atom can help stabilize the positive charge when it's at C2, C4, and C6. This is a favorable pathway.\n    *   **Substitution at any other position (C2, C4, or C6):** The formation of the sigma complex would involve resonance structures where the positive charge is placed directly on C1, the carbon atom attached to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group. Such a structure is extremely high in energy and strongly disfavored.\n    Therefore, substitution occurs almost exclusively at C5, leading to the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, in high yield.\n\nThe first three steps of sequence B provide a valid, high-yield route to the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv to vii) are extraneous and would modify the product if carried out, suggesting a possible flaw in the question's construction. However, among the given choices, option B is the only one that contains a chemically sound and high-yield synthetic pathway to the target molecule.\n\n<<<B>>>"
