    "This problem requires us to calculate the molar fraction of a specific complex species, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)2]`, in a solution and then express it as a percentage. This can be solved by applying the principles of chemical equilibrium for complex formation.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify all species:**\n    In a solution containing `Co^2+` and `SCN^-`, a series of complexation equilibria will be established. The cobalt-containing species are:\n    *   `[Co^2+]` (free aquated ion)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]^+`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]^-`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n\n2.  **Define the formation equilibria:**\n    The formation of these complexes is governed by the overall stability constants (βn):\n    *   `Co^2+ + SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)]^+` ;  `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]^+] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]) = 9`\n    *   `Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)2]` ;  `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) = 40`\n    *   `Co^2+ + 3 SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)3]^-` ; `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]^-] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3) = 63`\n    *   `Co^2+ + 4 SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)4]^2-` ; `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4) = 16`\n\n3.  **Express concentrations in terms of the free metal ion:**\n    We can rearrange the stability constant expressions to express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co^2+]`, and the ligand concentration, `[SCN^-]`.\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\n4.  **Define the total cobalt concentration:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species.\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\n    Substitute the expressions from the previous step:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN^-]^4`\n\n    Factor out `[Co^2+]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the molar fraction (αn):**\n    The molar fraction of a specific species, `[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)`, is denoted by `αn` and is defined as the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration. We are interested in `[Co(SCN)2]`, so we need to find `α2`.\n\n    `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n    Substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)2]]` and `c(Co)`:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4))`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leaving:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n6.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    We are given:\n    *   `c(Co) = 10^-2 M`\n    *   `[SCN^-] = 0.1 M` (We can assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the total ligand concentration because it is in large excess compared to the metal ion concentration).\n    *   `β1=9`, `β2=40`, `β3=63`, `β4=16`.\n\n    Let's calculate the numerator and denominator terms. Let `L = [SCN^-] = 0.1`.\n    *   Numerator term: `β2 * L^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   Denominator terms:\n        *   `1`\n        *   `β1 * L = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n        *   `β2 * L^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n        *   `β3 * L^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 0.063`\n        *   `β4 * L^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016`\n    *   Denominator sum: `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    Now, we can find `α2`:\n    `α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n7.  **Convert to percentage:**\n    Percentage of `[Co(SCN)2]` = `α2 * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can use a short Python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given stability constants and ligand concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nligand_conc = 0.1\n\n# The expression for the molar fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (alpha2) is:\n# alpha2 = (beta2 * [L]^2) / (1 + beta1*[L] + beta2*[L]^2 + beta3*[L]^3 + beta4*[L]^4)\n# where L is the ligand SCN-.\n\n# Calculate the numerator\nnumerator = beta2 * (ligand_conc**2)\n\n# Calculate the denominator\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * ligand_conc + beta2 * (ligand_conc**2) + beta3 * (ligand_conc**3) + beta4 * (ligand_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha2\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n\n16.91618032648228\n\nThe result from the calculation is approximately 16.9%, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This is a classic chemical equilibrium problem involving complex formation.\n\n### **1. Understanding the System**\n\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions (`Co^2+`) react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN^-`) to form a series of complexes:\n*   `Co^2+ + SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)]^+`\n*   `Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)2]` (the species of interest)\n*   `Co^2+ + 3 SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)3]^-`\n*   `Co^2+ + 4 SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free cobalt ion and all its complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\n### **2. Using Stability Constants (β)**\n\nThe overall stability constants (`βn`) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion (`[Co^2+]`) and the free ligand (`[SCN^-]`):\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\n### **3. Calculating the Molar Fraction (α)**\n\nThe molar fraction of a specific complex, for example, `[Co(SCN)2]`, is denoted as `α2` and is defined as:\n`α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\nWe can substitute the expressions from steps 1 and 2 into this equation:\n`α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN^-]^4)`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term is common to all terms in the numerator and denominator, so it can be canceled out. This leaves us with an expression that depends only on the free ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n`α2 = (β2 * [SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n### **4. Performing the Calculation**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `β1 = 9`\n*   `β2 = 40`\n*   `β3 = 63`\n*   `β4 = 16`\n*   `[SCN^-]` = 0.1 M (Since the thiocyanate concentration is in large excess compared to the cobalt concentration, we can approximate the free ligand concentration as the total ligand concentration).\n\nLet's plug these values into the equation for `α2`:\n\n*   **Numerator**: `β2 * [SCN^-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   **Denominator**:\n    *   `1`\n    *   `β1[SCN^-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   `β2[SCN^-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n    *   `β3[SCN^-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 0.063`\n    *   `β4[SCN^-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016`\n*   **Sum of Denominator**: `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, we calculate `α2`:\n`α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis calculation was verified by the Python code, which gave a result of `16.916...%`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 16.9%\nB) 42.3%\nC) 38.1%\nD) 25.6%\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
