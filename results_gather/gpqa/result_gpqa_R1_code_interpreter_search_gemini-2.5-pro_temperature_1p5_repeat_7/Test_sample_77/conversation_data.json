    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning to arrive at the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Problem:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge q. This is a standard problem in classical electrodynamics, and the solutions are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key concept is \"retardation\" – the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, c. Therefore, the field at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time t depends on the state of the charge (position and velocity) at an earlier time, called the retarded time, $t_r$.\n\n2.  **Define the Variables:**\n    *   $q$: The charge of the point particle.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t')$: The position vector of the charge as a function of time $t'$.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n    *   $t$: The time of observation.\n    *   $t_r$: The retarded time. This is the time at which the signal (electromagnetic field) was emitted from the charge to reach point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point. So, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   $d$: The magnitude of $\\vec{d}$, i.e., $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, i.e., $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}\\bigg|_{t'=t_r}$.\n    *   $c$: The speed of light in vacuum.\n    *   $\\epsilon_0$: Permittivity of free space.\n    *   $\\mu_0$: Permeability of free space.\n\n3.  **The Retardation Condition:** The time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ is $d/c$. This must be equal to the time difference $t - t_r$.\n    Therefore, the fundamental relationship defining the retarded time is:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\n4.  **Starting Point: The Retarded Potentials Integrals:** The general solutions for V and $\\vec{A}$ in terms of charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n5.  **Apply to a Point Charge:** For a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t')$, the densities are:\n    *   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\delta^3$ is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function.\n    *   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Integrals (Conceptual Sketch):**\n    Substituting these densities into the integral formulas seems straightforward due to the delta function, but there's a subtlety: the argument of the delta function, $\\vec{s}(t')$, depends on $t'$, which is the retarded time $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$, and this retarded time itself depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A careful evaluation (often done in advanced E&M textbooks like Griffiths, Jackson, or Zangwill) shows that the delta function introduces a Jacobian-like factor.\n    The result of this integration is:\n    $\\int \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}(t_r) \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd}\\right)}$\n\n7.  **Derive the Scalar Potential V:**\n    Using the result from step 6, the scalar potential becomes:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    To match the form in the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n8.  **Derive the Vector Potential $\\vec{A}$:**\n    The integral for $\\vec{A}$ is almost identical, just with an extra factor of $\\vec{v}(t_r')$ inside. This factor is constant with respect to the spatial integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. So, we get:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    Again, multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n9.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   **A)** Incorrect V. Static form.\n    *   **B)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n    *   **C)** Incorrect sign in the denominator. The physical reason for the minus sign is related to the Doppler effect; if the source moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), the effective time the charge spends emitting the received signal is compressed, leading to a stronger field (smaller denominator).\n    *   **D)** Incorrect V and dimensionally/vectorially incorrect $\\vec{A}$.\n\n10. **Final Check:** We can also verify the well-known relationship between the Liénard-Wiechert potentials: $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$.\n    From option B:\n    $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = (\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0) \\vec{v} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right)$\n    Using the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0)$, we get:\n    $\\vec{A} = \\frac{1}{c^2} \\vec{v} V$.\n    The expressions in option B are internally consistent and match the standard Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<B>>>"
