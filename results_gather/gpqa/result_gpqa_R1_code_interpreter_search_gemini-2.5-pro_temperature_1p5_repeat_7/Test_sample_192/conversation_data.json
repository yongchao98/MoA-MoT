    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Input Information:**\n    *   We are given an observational relationship for the number of stars, `N`, as a function of their parallax, `plx`. The relationship is `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   The question asks for how the number of stars per unit range of distance, `n(r)`, changes with distance `r`. This quantity `n(r)` is mathematically represented as `dN/dr`.\n\n2.  **Establish the Fundamental Relationship between Distance and Parallax:**\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to distance (`r`). The standard formula is `plx = 1/r` (when `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n\n3.  **Interpret the Given Relation `N ∝ 1/plx^5`:**\n    *   In astronomy, when we talk about star counts as a function of a limiting property (like magnitude or parallax), we usually refer to the cumulative number of objects within that limit.\n    *   So, \"the number of stars varies with parallax\" is best interpreted as the cumulative number of stars with a parallax *greater than* a certain value `plx`. A larger parallax means a smaller distance.\n    *   Therefore, `N(>plx)` represents the total number of stars from the observer out to a distance `r = 1/plx`. Let's denote this cumulative number of stars within distance `r` as `N_c(r)`.\n    *   So, the given relation is `N(>plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n\n4.  **Translate the Relation from Parallax to Distance:**\n    *   We want to express the cumulative number of stars as a function of distance `r`, i.e., find `N_c(r)`.\n    *   We know `N_c(r) = N(>plx)` where `r = 1/plx`.\n    *   Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the given proportionality:\n        `N_c(r) ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`\n        `N_c(r) ∝ r⁵`\n    *   This tells us that the total number of stars observed out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r⁵`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for the number of stars *per unit range of distance*. This is the rate of change of the cumulative number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative `dN_c/dr`.\n    *   We have the proportionality `N_c(r) = k * r⁵` for some constant `k`.\n    *   Now, we differentiate `N_c(r)` with respect to `r`:\n        `dN_c/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵)`\n        `dN_c/dr = 5 * k * r⁴`\n    *   This shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r⁴`.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) varies as `r⁴`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
