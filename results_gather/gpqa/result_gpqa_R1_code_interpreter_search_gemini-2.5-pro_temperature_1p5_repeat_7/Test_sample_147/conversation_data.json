    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2.**\n    The problem states that compound A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (formula YF_n) and has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    Let M_Y be the molar mass of element Y and M_F be the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol).\n    The formula for the mass percentage of fluorine is:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for M_Y:\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + n * 19.00)\n    0.3196 * M_Y + 0.3196 * 19.00 * n = 19.00 * n\n    0.3196 * M_Y = (19.00 - 6.0724) * n\n    0.3196 * M_Y = 12.9276 * n\n    M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We need to find an integer `n` that results in a realistic atomic mass M_Y for an element Y that can form multiple fluorides.\n    *   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, but its chemistry doesn't fit).\n    *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine, but its fluorides don't match the %F).\n    *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   n=4: M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dysprosium, but its chemistry doesn't fit, as we'll see).\n    *   n=5: M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol (several heavy elements are nearby, but the fit is less precise).\n    *   n=6: M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol (close to Plutonium, but its fluoride chemistry creates contradictions with the problem statement).\n\n    Let's verify the %F for A2 = SbF3.\n    M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol.\n    %F = (3 * 18.998) / 178.754 * 100% = 31.88%. This is extremely close to the given 31.96%, with a difference of only 0.08%.\n    So, we can confidently identify **Y = Sb** (Antimony) and **A2 = SbF3**.\n\n2.  **Identify Compound A3.**\n    A3 is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Sb) with fluorine. It can also interact with xenon.\n    The reaction Sb + F2 (excess) -> SbF5. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5) is a very powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent. It is known to react with xenon or xenon fluorides to form complex salts like [XeF]+[SbF6]−.\n    Thus, **A3 = SbF5**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the remaining compounds and reactions.**\n    We have five compounds: A1, A2(SbF3), A3(SbF5), A4, A5.\n    The properties of A1 (bright-red, decomposes to SbF3 and F2 at room temperature) are problematic as SbF5 is colorless and stable. However, this information might be a distractor or refer to an obscure compound not needed to find A4. Let's proceed by focusing on the reaction involving A4.\n\n4.  **Identify Compound A4.**\n    The key information is: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\n    Let's substitute what we know:\n    *   Y = Sb\n    *   Reaction: Sb + A4 -> A5 (in a 1:1 molar ratio)\n    *   A4 is a binary fluoride of Antimony.\n    *   A5 disproportionates in water (this is implied by forming two substances from a single one, suggesting a compound with an unstable oxidation state).\n\n    We must identify A4. Let's consider the possible binary fluorides of antimony for A4 from the given options for its molecular weight.\n    *   A4 could be SbF3. Molar mass of SbF3 is ~178.76 g/mol. This falls perfectly within the range **C) 160-180**.\n    *   A4 could be SbF5. Molar mass of SbF5 is ~216.75 g/mol. This value is close to, but outside, the range A) 220-240.\n\n    Let's test the chemical plausibility of A4 being SbF3.\n    *   If A4 = SbF3, the reaction is Sb(0) + Sb(III)F3 -> A5 (1:1).\n    *   This is a reaction between an element in its 0 oxidation state and its +3 oxidation state. This could plausibly form a sub-valent or mixed-valence compound. Given the 1:1 stoichiometry, A5 would have the formula Sb2F3.\n    *   A compound like Sb2F3 would have an average oxidation state of +1.5 for Sb. Such compounds are expected to be unstable in water and disproportionate. For example:\n        `Sb2F3 + H2O -> Sb(s) + Sb(OH)3 + HF`\n        This reaction produces Antimony metal (Sb) and an Antimony(III) compound, which are \"two substances\". This fits the description perfectly.\n\n    Now, let's test the plausibility of A4 being SbF5.\n    *   If A4 = SbF5, the reaction is Sb(0) + Sb(V)F5 -> A5.\n    *   This is a classic comproportionation reaction. The known reaction is `Sb + 2SbF5 -> 3SbF3`. This is a 1:2 molar ratio, not the 1:1 ratio stated in the problem. This contradicts the problem's conditions.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    The only option that is chemically consistent with all the reaction details (1:1 ratio, decomposition of A5) is that A4 is SbF3. The molecular weight of SbF3 is approximately 178.76 g/mol.\n\n    This value falls in the range **160-180**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
