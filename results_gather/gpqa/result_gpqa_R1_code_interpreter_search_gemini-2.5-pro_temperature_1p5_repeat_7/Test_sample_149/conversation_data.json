    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the NMR data.**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The formula for DBE is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) plus one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** A signal in this region (9-10 ppm) is highly indicative of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1 rule, n=2). This suggests a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the two protons of the -CH2- group inferred above. The doublet (d) multiplicity confirms it is coupled to a single proton (n=1), which is the aldehyde proton. So, we have confirmed the **-CH2-CHO** (phenylacetaldehyde) fragment.\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for an amine group (-NH2), which is consistent with the nitrogen in the molecular formula.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    Putting the pieces together—a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with -NH2 and -CH2-CHO substituents—gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (side chain) + NH2 = C8H9NO. The formula matches perfectly.\n\n**Starting Material:**\n```\n      NH2\n       |\n      / \\\n    ||   ||\n    \\\\   //\n      |\n     CH2-CHO\n```\n(4-aminophenylacetaldehyde)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n1.  **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O (Diazotization followed by Hydrolysis)**\n    *   The first step (NaNO2, HCl, typically at 0-5°C) is the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   The second step (adding H2O and warming) hydrolyzes the diazonium salt, replacing the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The aldehyde group (-CH2-CHO) is unreactive under these conditions.\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Intermediate Product:**\n```\n      OH\n       |\n      / \\\n    ||   ||\n    \\\\   //\n      |\n     CH2-CHO\n```\n(4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde)\n\n2.  **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Base-Catalyzed Aldol Condensation)**\n    *   We have an aldehyde (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) that possesses alpha-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-aldol condensation.\n    *   **Step a: Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an acidic alpha-proton from one molecule to form an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde (an \"aldol\").\n        *   The structure of the aldol addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (which corresponds to option C).\n\n    *   **Step b: Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. This provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. A proton is lost from the alpha-carbon (C2) and the hydroxyl group is lost from the beta-carbon (C3). This forms a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new double bond is conjugated with both the aldehyde's carbonyl group and one of the phenyl rings.\n\n**Final Product Formation:**\n\n*   **Aldol Adduct (from addition):**\n    ```\n            OH         OH\n             |          |\n            / \\        / \\\n          ||   ||-CH2-CH - CH - CHO\n          \\\\   //      |    |\n             |       (Ph-OH)\n    ```\n    (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal)\n\n*   **Dehydration (-H2O) with heat:**\n    ```\n            OH                 OH\n             |                  |\n            / \\                / \\\n          ||   ||-CH2 - CH = C - CHO\n          \\\\   //           |\n             |            (Ph-OH)\n    ```\n    The IUPAC name for this structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option A.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction sequence converts 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. The inclusion of heat in the final step ensures that the reaction proceeds to the dehydrated, conjugated final product.\n\n*   Option B is structurally incorrect.\n*   Option C is the intermediate aldol addition product, but not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   Option D is missing the hydroxyl groups.\n*   Option A correctly represents the final, stable aldol condensation product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
