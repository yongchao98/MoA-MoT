    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between wavelength shift and radial velocity.**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method measures the periodic change in a star's velocity along our line of sight. This velocity change is caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The Doppler effect causes the light from the star to be redshifted or blueshifted, which is observed as a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines.\n    The formula for the Doppler shift is:\n    `Δλ / λ = v_r / c`\n    Where `Δλ` is the wavelength shift, `λ` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line, `v_r` is the radial velocity of the star, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    The maximum observed wavelength shift (`Δλ_max`) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, denoted as `K`.\n    Therefore, `K` is directly proportional to `Δλ_max`.\n    `K ∝ Δλ_max`\n    Given the periodic shifts are `Δλ_1 = 5 mÅ` and `Δλ_2 = 7 mÅ`, we have the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes:\n    `K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 5 / 7`\n\n2.  **Relate the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital period (T).**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the host star is given by the formula:\n    `K = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star + m_p)^(2/3)`\n    where:\n    *   `T` is the orbital period of the planet.\n    *   `m_p` is the mass of the planet.\n    *   `M_star` is the mass of the star.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\n    The problem states that `M_star >> m_p`, so we can simplify `(M_star + m_p)` to `M_star`.\n    `K ≈ (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n\n3.  **Analyze the relationship for the two systems.**\n    The problem gives us the following information:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: `M_star1 = M_star2 = M_star`.\n    *   The planets have the same mass: `m_p1 = m_p2 = m_p`.\n    *   Constants `G` and `2π` are the same for both.\n    *   The problem doesn't specify the inclinations (`i`). However, in the absence of this information, we assume that the orbital inclinations are statistically likely to be similar or that the comparison is based on the observed values. The relationship holds regardless of the specific value of `sin(i)` as long as we assume it is the same for both systems.\n\n    Based on these conditions, all terms in the equation for `K` are constant for both systems except for `K` and `T`.\n    `K ∝ (1 / T)^(1/3)` or `K ∝ T^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the ratio of the orbital periods (T2 / T1).**\n    From the proportionality `K ∝ T^(-1/3)`, we can write `T^(-1/3) ∝ K`, which means `T ∝ K^(-3)`.\n    So, the ratio of the periods is:\n    `T2 / T1 = (K2 / K1)^(-3) = (K1 / K2)^3`\n\n5.  **Substitute the known values.**\n    We already found that `K1 / K2 = 5 / 7`.\n    Substituting this into the equation for the period ratio:\n    `T2 / T1 = (5 / 7)^3 = 5^3 / 7^3 = 125 / 343`\n\n6.  **Calculate the final numerical value.**\n    Now, we compute the value of the fraction `125 / 343`.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods\n# T2 / T1 = (K1 / K2)^3\n# K is proportional to the wavelength shift, so K1/K2 = 5/7\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_result>\nThe result is approximately 0.36. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 is approximately 0.36.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The Doppler effect tells us that the change in wavelength (`Δλ`) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (`v_r`). Therefore, the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, `K`, is directly proportional to the maximum observed periodic wavelength shift (`Δλ_max`).\n    *   `K ∝ Δλ_max`\n    *   So, the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Period:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is given by the formula:\n    `K = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))` (assuming the planet's mass `m_p` is much smaller than the star's mass `M_star`).\n\n3.  **Setting up the Ratio:** The problem states that the star masses (`M_star`) are identical, and the planet masses (`m_p`) are similar. We assume the orbital inclinations (`i`) are the same for this comparison. All other terms (`2π`, `G`) are constants. This simplifies the relationship to:\n    *   `K ∝ T^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Solving for the Period Ratio:** From the proportionality above, we can express the period `T` in terms of `K`:\n    *   `T ∝ K⁻³`\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the periods is `T₂ / T₁ = (K₂ / K₁)⁻³ = (K₁ / K₂)³`.\n\n5.  **Calculation:** We substitute the ratio of the radial velocities we found in step 1:\n    *   `T₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n    *   `T₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<D>>>"
