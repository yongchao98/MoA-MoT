    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the key variables:**\n    *   `d`: Distance to a star.\n    *   `plx`: Parallax of the star. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The relationship is `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   `ρ` (rho): The number density of stars, which is the number of stars per unit volume. The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed, so `ρ` is a constant.\n    *   `N`: The number of stars.\n\n2.  **Calculate the number of stars in a spherical shell:**\n    *   We want to find the number of stars, `dN`, that are located at a distance between `d` and `d + dd`. These stars occupy a thin spherical shell.\n    *   The volume of a sphere of radius `d` is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   The volume of the thin spherical shell, `dV`, can be found by differentiating the volume `V` with respect to `d`:\n        `dV = dV/dd * dd = 4πd² dd`\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars `dN` in this shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax (plx):**\n    *   The goal is to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/dplx`) changes with `plx`. To do this, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   We know `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find `dd` in terms of `dplx`. We can differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/dplx = d(1/plx)/dplx = -1/plx²`\n        So, `dd = (-1/plx²) dplx`.\n    *   When we consider the number of stars in a small range of parallax, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign (it just indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases).\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) dplx`\n\n4.  **Substitute back into the equation for dN:**\n    *   Now substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` into the equation `dN = ρ * 4πd² dd`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) dplx`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) dplx`\n\n5.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `dN/dplx`.\n    *   From the equation above, we can divide by `dplx`:\n        `dN/dplx = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴)`\n\n6.  **Determine the proportionality:**\n    *   In the final expression, `ρ`, `4`, and `π` are all constants. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is directly proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   `dN/dplx ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
