    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The reaction causes the bromination of the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the adjacent electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups. This forms an enolate anion: `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻`.\n    2.  The \"excess\" NaH and the presence of a di-functional alkylating agent (1,5-dibromopentane) suggest an intermolecular reaction is more likely than an intramolecular cyclization. This is because there is sufficient enolate and base to favor a reaction where two enolate molecules react with one molecule of the dibromide. One molecule of enolate reacts at each end.\n    3.  The reaction is: `2 [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt) + 2 Br⁻`.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is diethyl 2,9-dicyanodecanedioate. Its structure is:\n    ```\n        CN                             CN\n        |                              |\n    EtOOC-CH - (CH2) - (CH2) - (CH2) - (CH2) - (CH2) - CH - COOEt\n    ```\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\nProduct 4 has two chiral centers (the two `CH` carbons). The reaction will produce a mixture of diastereomers: a racemic pair ((R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers) and a meso compound (R,S). Statistically, the racemic pair is the major product. The NMR of a racemic mixture is identical to the NMR of a single enantiomer. Let's analyze one enantiomer, for example, the (R,R) isomer.\n\nThe (R,R) isomer possesses a C2 axis of symmetry that passes through the central CH2 group (C5) of the pentamethylene bridge. This symmetry makes pairs of groups chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments:\n1.  **Alpha-CH Protons:** The two `CH` protons are equivalent due to the C2 symmetry. They will produce **1 signal**.\n2.  **Ethyl Groups (-OCH2CH3):** The two ethyl groups are equivalent by C2 symmetry. We only need to analyze one.\n    *   **CH3 protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent. This is **1 signal**.\n    *   **OCH2 protons:** The two protons of the methylene group are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a chiral center. They are chemically inequivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n3.  **Pentamethylene Bridge Protons (-(CH2)5-):** The bridge has 5 CH2 groups. The C2 symmetry makes them non-equivalent in pairs.\n    *   Let the bridge be `-C(1)H2-C(2)H2-C(3)H2-C(4)H2-C(5)H2-` where C(1) is attached to the first alpha-carbon. The C2 axis relates C(1) with C(5), and C(2) with C(4). C(3) is unique and lies on the axis.\n    *   **C(1) and C(5) protons:** These two CH2 groups are equivalent. The two protons on each group are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C(2) and C(4) protons:** These two CH2 groups are equivalent. The two protons on each group are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C(3) protons:** This CH2 group is unique. Its two protons are also diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nSumming up all the distinct signals:\n*   From alpha-CH: 1\n*   From ethyl groups: 1 (for CH3) + 2 (for OCH2) = 3\n*   From the bridge: 2 (for C1/C5) + 2 (for C2/C4) + 2 (for C3) = 6\n\nTotal signals = 1 + 3 + 6 = 10.\n\n<<<D>>>"
