    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   A is the planet's Bond albedo.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Temperatures:**\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\nT_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))\nT_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n\nDividing the first equation by the second:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and that they have the same albedo (A1 = A2). This allows us to cancel these terms:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a1)) * ((2 * a2) / R_star))\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nSo, the problem is reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data:**\nThe radial velocity method provides information that can be used to determine the semi-major axis. The semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) induced by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) * sin(i)\nwhere:\n*   M_p is the mass of the planet.\n*   M_star is the mass of the star.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n\nSince the planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination `i` is close to 90°, and thus sin(i) ≈ 1.\nThe formula simplifies to:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\nK^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)\nK^2 = (M_p^2 * G) / (a * M_star)\na = (M_p^2 * G) / (K^2 * M_star)\n\n**5. Formulate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:**\nNow we can find the ratio a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = [(M_p2^2 * G) / (K2^2 * M_star)] / [(M_p1^2 * G) / (K1^2 * M_star)]\n\nThe terms for the gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) cancel out:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n**6. Relate Radial Velocity (K) to Doppler Shift (Δλ):**\nThe radial velocity (K) is calculated from the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) of a spectral line using the formula:\nK = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocities K1 / K2 is:\nK1 / K2 = [c * (Δλ_1 / λ_0)] / [c * (Δλ_2 / λ_0)]\nThe terms `c` and λ_0 cancel out, leaving:\nK1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n\n**7. Substitute and Calculate:**\nNow we substitute the ratio of Doppler shifts back into the equation for a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\nNow, plug these values into the equation:\n*   Ratio of masses (M_p2 / M_p1) = 5 / 7\n*   Ratio of Doppler shifts (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2) = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n**8. Final Calculation of Temperature Ratio:**\nFinally, we substitute the value of a2 / a1 back into our temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nTo get the numerical value:\n15 ÷ 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nMp1 = 7  # Earth masses\nMp2 = 5  # Earth masses\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03  # Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04  # Angstroms\n\n# Ratio of masses (Mp2 / Mp1)\nmass_ratio = Mp2 / Mp1\n\n# Ratio of radial velocities (K1 / K2), which is equal to the ratio of Doppler shifts (Δλ1 / Δλ2)\nK_ratio = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# The ratio of semi-major axes a2/a1 is given by (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na2_over_a1 = (mass_ratio**2) * (K_ratio**2)\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1/T_eq2 is sqrt(a2/a1)\ntemp_ratio = math.sqrt(a2_over_a1)\n\nprint(f\"{temp_ratio:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculations performed are correct. The final answer is derived from the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature, its semi-major axis, and the observational data from the radial velocity method.\n\n**Summary of Logic:**\n1.  The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) for two planets around the same star with the same albedo simplifies to `sqrt(a2 / a1)`, where `a1` and `a2` are the semi-major axes of the planets.\n2.  The semi-major axis `a` can be related to the planet's mass (`M_p`) and the radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) it induces on the star by the formula `a ∝ M_p² / K²`.\n3.  The radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` (`K ∝ Δλ`).\n4.  Combining these proportions, we find that `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)² = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)²`.\n5.  Plugging in the given values:\n    *   M_p1 = 7, M_p2 = 5\n    *   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å, Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n    *   `a2 / a1 = (5/7)² * (0.03/0.04)² = (25/49) * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784`.\n6.  Finally, the temperature ratio is `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784) = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`.\n\nThe python code correctly calculated this value, and the output `0.54` is the result rounded to two decimal places. This result corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
