    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu). The decay reaction is:\n    $$\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu_\\mu$$\n\n2.  **State the given information:**\n    *   Rest mass energy of Pi+ ($$m_{\\pi^+}c^2$$) = 139.6 MeV.\n    *   Rest mass energy of mu+ ($$m_{\\mu^+}c^2$$) = 105.7 MeV.\n    *   The initial Pi+ is stationary, meaning its initial momentum is zero ($$p_i = 0$$) and its initial kinetic energy is zero ($$KE_i = 0$$).\n    *   The muon neutrino ($$\\nu_\\mu$$) is considered to have zero rest mass ($$m_\\nu \\approx 0$$).\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay. Since the pion is stationary, the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n        $$p_i = p_f = 0$$\n        The two product particles, the muon and the neutrino, must move in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let this magnitude be 'p'.\n        $$| \\vec{p}_{\\mu} | = | \\vec{p}_{\\nu} | = p$$\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n        $$E_i = E_f$$\n        The initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion:\n        $$E_i = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \\text{ MeV}$$\n        The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino:\n        $$E_f = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$$\n        So, $$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$$\n\n4.  **Use Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) of a particle are related by the equation:\n    $$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$$\n\n    *   **For the neutrino ($$\\nu_\\mu$$):** Since its rest mass is zero, its total energy is given by $$E_{\\nu} = pc$$. Also, for a massless particle, the total energy is equal to its kinetic energy, so $$KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$$.\n\n    *   **For the muon ($$\\mu^+$$):** Its total energy is $$E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$$. Its kinetic energy is $$KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu^+}c^2$$.\n\n5.  **Solve for the momentum (p):**\n    Substitute the expressions for $$E_{\\mu}$$ and $$E_{\\nu}$$ into the energy conservation equation:\n    $$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2} + pc$$\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for $$pc$$:\n    $$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$$\n    Square both sides:\n    $$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$$\n    $$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$$\n    The $$(pc)^2$$ terms cancel out:\n    $$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$$\n    Solve for $$pc$$:\n    $$pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)}$$\n\n6.  **Calculate the numerical values:**\n    Plug in the given mass-energy values:\n    $$pc = \\frac{(139.6 \\text{ MeV})^2 - (105.7 \\text{ MeV})^2}{2 \\times 139.6 \\text{ MeV}}$$\n    $$pc = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} \\text{ MeV}$$\n    $$pc = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\text{ MeV} \\approx 29.784 \\text{ MeV}$$\n    The calculation can be performed using Python for precision:\n    ```python\n    m_pi_c2 = 139.6\n    m_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n    # Momentum term\n    pc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n    print(f\"pc = {pc:.3f} MeV\")\n\n    # Kinetic energy of neutrino\n    KE_nu = pc\n    print(f\"KE_nu = {KE_nu:.3f} MeV\")\n\n    # Kinetic energy of muon\n    import math\n    E_mu = math.sqrt(pc**2 + m_mu_c2**2)\n    KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n    print(f\"KE_mu = {KE_mu:.3f} MeV\")\n    ```\n    The output of the code is:\n    ```\n    pc = 29.784 MeV\n    KE_nu = 29.784 MeV\n    KE_mu = 4.116 MeV\n    ```\n\n7.  **Final Results:**\n    *   The kinetic energy of the neutrino is $$KE_{\\nu} = pc \\approx 29.8 \\text{ MeV}$$.\n    *   The kinetic energy of the muon is $$KE_{\\mu} \\approx 4.12 \\text{ MeV}$$.\n\n8.  **Compare with options:**\n    The calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
