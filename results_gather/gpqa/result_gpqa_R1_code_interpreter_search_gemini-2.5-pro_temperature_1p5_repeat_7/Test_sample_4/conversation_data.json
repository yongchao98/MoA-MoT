    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum Mechanical Operators:**\n    The problem provides the components of the spin operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle. The operators are given in terms of the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$):\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector:**\n    The problem specifies that the direction vector $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary direction lying in the x-z plane. A unit vector in the x-z plane can be parameterized by a single angle, $\\theta$. In physics, it is conventional to use the polar angle from the z-axis. In this convention, the unit vector $\\vec{n}$ in spherical coordinates is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$. The y-component is zero because the vector is in the x-z plane, which corresponds to an azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$.\n\n3.  **Construct the Spin Operator along the Direction $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The operator for the spin measurement along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    Substituting the components of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n    $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y(0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta$\n    Combining the matrices:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set Up and Solve the Eigenvalue Equation:**\n    We are looking for the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. Let the eigenvector be represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    We can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n    (i) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    (ii) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n5.  **Find the Relationship between the Eigenvector Components:**\n    Let's solve for the ratio $b/a$ using the first equation:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n    To simplify this expression, we use the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n    Substituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    So, the components of the eigenvector are related by $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:**\n    The eigenvector is of the form $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. We can choose a convenient value for $a$ and then normalize. Let's set $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$. Then $b = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n    So the unnormalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle_{un} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Now, let's check its normalization. The squared norm is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components:\n    $N^2 = |\\cos(\\theta/2)|^2 + |\\sin(\\theta/2)|^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n    Since the norm is already 1, the eigenvector is already normalized.\n\n7.  **Final Answer:**\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. Comparing this with the given options, we find that it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
