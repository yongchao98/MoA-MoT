    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Part 1: Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nSince the astronauts are traveling at relativistic speeds, we must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. The formula for the relative velocity (v_rel) of an object with velocity v1 with respect to an object with velocity v2 (both measured in the same inertial frame) is:\n\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut, v1 = 0.6c\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut, v2 = 0.5c\n*   Both are in the positive x-direction.\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel = (1/7)c\nv_rel ≈ 0.142857c\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a particle moving at relativistic speed is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the two astronauts:\nE_total = E1 + E2\n\n**For Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass (m1) = 2m\n*   Velocity (v1) = 0.6c\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ1):\n    γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   Now, calculate the energy (E1):\n    E1 = γ1 * m1 * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²\n\n**For Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass (m2) = 3m\n*   Velocity (v2) = 0.5c\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ2):\n    γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75)\n*   Now, calculate the energy (E2):\n    E2 = γ2 * m2 * c² = (1 / sqrt(0.75)) * (3m) * c²\n\n**Calculate Total Energy (E_total):**\nE_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 mc² + (3 / sqrt(0.75)) mc²\n\nTo get a numerical value, let's execute a small script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Part 1: Relative Velocity\nv_rel_c = (0.6 - 0.5) / (1 - 0.6 * 0.5)\nprint(f\"Relative velocity (in terms of c): {v_rel_c:.4f}\")\n\n# Part 2: Total Energy\n# E_total = E1 + E2 = (gamma1 * m1 + gamma2 * m2) * c^2\n# We calculate E_total / (m * c^2)\nm1_m = 2.0\nm2_m = 3.0\nv1_c = 0.6\nv2_c = 0.5\n\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1_c**2)\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2_c**2)\n\nenergy_factor = gamma1 * m1_m + gamma2 * m2_m\nprint(f\"Total energy (in terms of mc^2): {energy_factor:.4f}\")\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nRelative velocity (in terms of c): 0.1429\nTotal energy (in terms of mc^2): 5.9641\n```\nThe calculations show:\n*   The relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n*   The total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nB) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nC) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nD) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\nOption D matches our calculated values.\n\n<<<D>>>",
