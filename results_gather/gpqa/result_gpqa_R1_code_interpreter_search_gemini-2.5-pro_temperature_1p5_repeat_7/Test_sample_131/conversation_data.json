    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both unknown compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **¹H NMR Data of the Mixture:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nWe need to predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each of the four given options to see which pair could produce the observed mixture spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one alkyl singlet** integrating to 12H.\n    *   **Summary for Durene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** There is a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent. This gives one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. This gives a second signal (6H).\n        *   This results in **two alkyl singlets**, each integrating to 6H (a 1:1 ratio between them).\n    *   **Summary for Prehnitene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H + 6H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** There is a single plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. They are in different environments and will produce **two different aromatic singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent by symmetry, giving one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at 2 is unique, giving a second signal (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at 5 is unique, giving a third signal (3H).\n        *   This results in **three alkyl singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary for Isodurene:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H + 1H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H + 3H + 3H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 -> C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The alkyl protons are part of ethyl groups. The methylene (-CH2-) protons will couple to the methyl (-CH3) protons, producing a **quartet** and a **triplet**, not singlets. Since the problem states the alkyl signals are all singlets, this compound can be immediately eliminated. This also eliminates option D.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Combinations**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives **2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio)** and **3 alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio)**.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Since the molecules are different, their singlets will have different chemical shifts. The mixture will therefore show **two aromatic singlets**. Because they both originate from 2 protons and the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio, their integrals will be equal, giving a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. Assuming all three signals have unique chemical shifts, the mixture will show **three alkyl singlets**. The integration ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This combination is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The total would be **three aromatic singlets** (with a 2:1:1 ratio). This does not match the data (which specifies two aromatic singlets).\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The total would be **three aromatic singlets** (with a 2:1:1 ratio). This does not match the data.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly the combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Option A) correctly predicts the number and integration ratios of all signals described in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the mixture.\n\n<<<A>>>"
