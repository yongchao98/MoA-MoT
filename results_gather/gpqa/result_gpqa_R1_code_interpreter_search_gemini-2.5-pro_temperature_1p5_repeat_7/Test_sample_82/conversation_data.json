    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n**1. Initial State & Dilution**\n\n*   First, we dilute the acetic acid. We can use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2 to find the new concentration of acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n    *   M1 (initial concentration) = 0.05 M\n    *   V1 (initial volume) = 20.00 cm3\n    *   V2 (final volume) = 20.00 cm3 (acid) + 20.00 cm3 (water) = 40.00 cm3\n    *   M2 (final concentration) = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm3) / 40.00 cm3 = 0.025 M\n*   So, we are titrating a 40.00 cm3 solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n*   The initial number of moles of acetic acid is: Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L * 0.040 L = 0.001 moles.\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   25% titration means that 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH3COO-), and 75% of the acid remains.\n*   This creates a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n    *   Where [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the acid.\n*   First, calculate pKa:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-] to [HA] is 25% to 75%, or 1 to 3.\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(25/75) = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is 4.25. Let's recompute it with higher precision.\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (a weak acid) has been completely neutralized by the NaOH (a strong base) to form sodium acetate (a weak base).\n*   First, find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. Moles of acid = Moles of base.\n    *   0.001 moles acid = 0.1 M * V_NaOH\n    *   V_NaOH = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm3\n*   The total volume of the solution at the equivalence point is:\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm3 (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm3 (NaOH) = 50.00 cm3 = 0.050 L\n*   The moles of acetate (CH3COO-) formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles.\n*   The concentration of the acetate solution is:\n    *   [CH3COO-] = 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   Now we have a solution of a weak base, so it will hydrolyze water, producing OH- ions:\n    *   CH3COO- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH-\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate. We can find it using Kw = Ka * Kb (where Kw = 1.0 x 10^-14 at 25 °C).\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10^-14) / (1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 5.41 x 10^-10\n*   We can set up an equilibrium expression: Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-]. Let x = [OH-].\n    *   5.41 x 10^-10 = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.41 x 10^-10 = x^2 / 0.02\n    *   x^2 = (5.41 x 10^-10) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10^-11\n    *   x = [OH-] = √(1.082 x 10^-11) ≈ 3.29 x 10^-6 M\n*   Now calculate pOH and then pH:\n    *   pOH = -log([OH-]) = -log(3.29 x 10^-6) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This corresponds to option A. I will use a Python script for a more precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa_acetic_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- pH at 25% Titration ---\n# pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acetic_acid)\npH_25 = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- pH at the Equivalence Point ---\n# 1.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning behind the solution:\n\n**Part 1: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Calculate the new concentration after dilution:**\n    *   The initial solution of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is diluted from 20.00 cm³ to a final volume of 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³.\n    *   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, where:\n        *   M₁ = 0.05 M\n        *   V₁ = 20.00 cm³\n        *   V₂ = 40.00 cm³\n    *   M₂ = (M₁ * V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n    *   So, we are titrating a 0.025 M acetic acid solution.\n\n2.  **Apply the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:**\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), by the NaOH. This means 75% of the original acetic acid remains.\n    *   This mixture of a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) forms a buffer solution.\n    *   The pH of a buffer is calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n        pH = pKa + log ( [A⁻] / [HA] )\n        where [A⁻] is the conjugate base concentration and [HA] is the weak acid concentration.\n    *   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n        pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n    *   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is equivalent to the ratio of moles, which is 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n    *   Now, plug the values into the equation:\n        pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places gives a pH of **4.26**.\n\n**Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Determine the conditions at the equivalence point:**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by an equal number of moles of NaOH.\n    *   Reaction: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n    *   The resulting solution contains only the salt, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), which dissociates completely into Na⁺ and the weak base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n\n2.  **Calculate the concentration of acetate (CH₃COO⁻) at the equivalence point:**\n    *   First, find the initial moles of acetic acid:\n        Moles of acid = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n    *   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added = moles of acid = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Calculate the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed:\n        Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n    *   Calculate the total volume of the solution:\n        Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acid (0.001 mol).\n    *   Calculate the concentration of acetate:\n        [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH of the weak base solution:**\n    *   Acetate hydrolyzes water, producing hydroxide ions (OH⁻):\n        CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate. We can find it using the relationship Kw = Ka × Kb, where Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C.\n        Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the [OH⁻] at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the change in concentration.\n        Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can simplify by assuming (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n        5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n        x² = (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 ≈ 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹\n        x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M\n    *   Calculate the pOH:\n        pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   Calculate the pH:\n        pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places gives a pH of **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
