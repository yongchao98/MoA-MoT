You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "*   **Analysis of the experimental plan:** The goal is to express a recombinant mouse GADD45G protein with an N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The expression failure is observed after transfecting CHO cells.\n*   **Analysis of the provided DNA sequence:** The sequence is the coding strand (plus strand) of the DNA construct. Translation will start at the first `ATG` codon. The sequence for the HA tag should be present at the beginning, following the start codon. The standard amino acid sequence for the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA.\n*   **Step 1: Decode the N-terminus of the sequence.** Let's break the beginning of the DNA sequence into codons (triplets) and translate them using the genetic code.\n    *   `ATG`: This is the start codon, coding for Methionine (M).\n    *   `TAC`: Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `CCA`: Proline (P)\n    *   `TAC`: Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GAT`: Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `GTT`: Valine (V)\n    *   `CCA`: Proline (P)\n    *   `GAT`: Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `TAC`: Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GCC`: Alanine (A)\n    *   The translated sequence so far is M-YPYDVPDYA. This corresponds to the start codon followed by the correct HA tag sequence. So, there is no missense mutation in the tag sequence, which rules out option B.\n\n*   **Step 2: Continue decoding the sequence.** Let's look at the codons immediately following the HA tag sequence.\n    *   The sequence after `...TAC GCC` is `AAA TGA...`\n    *   `AAA`: This codon codes for the amino acid Lysine (K).\n    *   `TGA`: This is one of the three stop codons (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`).\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the consequence.** When the ribosome translates the mRNA derived from this DNA, it will start at the `ATG`, successfully synthesize the HA tag and one lysine residue. However, upon reaching the `TGA` codon, translation will be prematurely terminated. The ribosome will detach, and the rest of the GADD45G coding sequence will not be translated. This results in the production of a very short, non-functional peptide (M-YPYDVPDYA-K) instead of the full-length fusion protein. This perfectly explains the observed lack of overexpression of the desired protein.\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the given options.**\n    *   A) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain: While a linker can be important for protein folding and stability, the primary issue here is that the full protein is not even synthesized. The premature stop codon is a more fundamental and direct cause of the failure.\n    *   B) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation: As determined in Step 1, the DNA sequence correctly codes for the HA tag.\n    *   C) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse: This statement is factually correct in principle for all organisms (stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs), but the stop codon found in the sequence is `TGA`, not `UAA`. More importantly, the presence of *any* stop codon in this position is the problem, not the specifics of how stop codons work.\n    *   D) The ribosome terminated the translation early: This is precisely what happens due to the `TGA` stop codon located immediately after the tag sequence.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a premature stop codon (`TGA`) in the sequence causes the ribosome to halt translation before the GADD45G protein can be synthesized.\n\n<<<D>>>"
