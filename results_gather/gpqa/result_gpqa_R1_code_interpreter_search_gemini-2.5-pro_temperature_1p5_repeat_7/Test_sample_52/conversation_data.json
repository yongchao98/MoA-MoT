    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Skeleton:** The problem states the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, which has a base formula of C6H4. The presence of two signals for aromatic protons in the 1H NMR spectrum strongly suggests a 1,4- (or *para*) substitution pattern, as this symmetry would make the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 equivalent, leading to two signals (typically two doublets).\n\n2.  **Identify Functional Groups from Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **FTIR:** An absorption peak for an ester group is observed. An ester group has the structure -COO-, contributing one carbon and two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** A benzene ring has 4 degrees of unsaturation (1 ring + 3 double bonds). The carbonyl group (C=O) in the ester adds another degree of unsaturation. This totals 5 DBEs from these two features alone.\n\n3.  **Decode the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** As discussed, this fits a C6H4 *para*-disubstituted ring.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals, one doublet (d), one doublet of quartets (dq)):** This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3.\n        *   Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   Proton H(a) is split only by proton H(b), resulting in a doublet (d).\n        *   Proton H(b) is split by proton H(a) (a doublet) and also by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (a quartet). This combined splitting gives a doublet of quartets (dq).\n        *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group (-C3H5) as one of the substituents. This group also accounts for one of the two -CH3 signals. The C=C double bond in this group adds a sixth degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One methyl signal comes from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The second methyl signal must come from the ester group, since there are no other places for it.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It rules out any substituent containing an ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), etc., chain.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   We have a *para*-substituted benzene ring: -C6H4-.\n    *   We have a propenyl group as one substituent: CH3-CH=CH-.\n    *   We have an ester group and a second methyl group. To avoid having any -CH2- groups, the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH3). This fragment contributes -C2H3O2 to the molecule.\n    *   Let's put the pieces together. The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are the propenyl group and the methyl ester group. A plausible structure is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n    *   Now, let's calculate the total molecular formula from the assembled parts:\n        *   From the benzene ring: C6H4\n        *   From the propenyl group: C3H5\n        *   From the methyl ester group: C2H3O2\n        *   **Total Carbon:** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n        *   **Total Hydrogen:** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n        *   **Total Oxygen:** 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation and Check Other Options:**\n    Let's use a Python script to calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for the derived structure and the given options. The formula for DBE is `C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`. In this case, there is no nitrogen (N=0). The derived structure has 1 benzene ring (4 DBE), 1 C=C bond (1 DBE), and 1 C=O bond (1 DBE), for a total of 6 DBEs.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dbe(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the degree of unsaturation for a given chemical formula.\"\"\"\n    # formula is a tuple (C, H, O)\n    C, H, O = formula\n    dbe = C - (H / 2) + 1\n    return dbe\n\noptions = {\n    'A': (12, 12, 2),\n    'B': (11, 12, 2),\n    'C': (11, 14, 2),\n    'D': (12, 14, 2)\n}\n\nprint(\"DBE for C11H12O2 (our deduced formula):\", calculate_dbe(options['B']))\nprint(\"-----\")\nfor option, formula in options.items():\n    print(f\"DBE for {option} (C{formula[0]}H{formula[1]}O{formula[2]}): {calculate_dbe(formula)}\")\n\n```\n>>>\nDBE for C11H12O2 (our deduced formula): 6.0\n-----\nDBE for A (C12H12O2): 7.0\nDBE for B (C11H12O2): 6.0\nDBE for C (C11H14O2): 5.0\nDBE for D (C12H14O2): 6.0\n<<<\nThe DBE calculation shows that our deduced formula (C11H12O2) and option D (C12H14O2) both have a DBE of 6, which matches our structural analysis. However, any plausible structure for C12H14O2 that includes a benzene ring, a propenyl group, and an ester (e.g., ethyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate, C12H14O2) would necessarily contain a -CH2- group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data. Therefore, C11H12O2 is the only option that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **Skeleton:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a benzene ring (C6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. The remaining part of the ring is C6H4. The aromatic ring itself accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (DBE).\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group is present (-COO-). This adds 1 carbon, 2 oxygens, and 1 degree of unsaturation (from the C=O double bond). Total DBE so far is 4 + 1 = 5.\n    *   **1H NMR:**\n        *   **2 aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring with two aromatic signals often implies a 1,4 (*para*) substitution pattern, which creates chemical symmetry.\n        *   **2 vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a `-CH=CH-CH3` group (a propenyl group). The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split into a doublet of quartets, and the other vinyl proton is a doublet. This group contributes C3H5 to the formula and another degree of unsaturation (from the C=C double bond). The total DBE is now 5 + 1 = 6.\n        *   **2 -CH3 signals:** One methyl group is from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The other must be part of the ester group.\n        *   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a critical piece of information. It eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`) or other longer alkyl chains.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecule:**\n    *   We have the `C6H4` core.\n    *   We have a propenyl substituent: `-C3H5`.\n    *   We have an ester substituent containing a methyl group and no methylene (`-CH2-`) groups. The only simple possibility is a methyl ester: `-COOCH3`. This fragment contributes `C2H3O2`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total chemical formula:**\n    *   **Carbon:** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogen:** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygen:** 2 (from methyl ester) = **2 Oxygens**\n    *   The final formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with the provided options and DBE:**\n    *   The derived formula, C11H12O2, corresponds to option B.\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for C11H12O2 is calculated as `C - H/2 + 1 = 11 - 12/2 + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6`. This matches our structural analysis (1 ring + 1 C=C + 1 C=O = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 DBE).\n    *   Let's check the other options. For example, C12H14O2 (Option D) also has 6 DBE. However, to form this molecule while keeping the core structure, one would need to add a CH2 group (e.g., making an ethyl ester), which contradicts the NMR data stating there are no -CH2- groups.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectral data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
