    "*   **Step 1: Determine the molecular structure from the given information.**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means it is a benzene ring with two substituents. A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms (C6).\n    *   The compound has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" Since the ring is C6, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n    *   The FTIR spectrum also shows an \"aromatic-halogen bond,\" meaning one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the benzene ring. Let's denote this as -X.\n    *   The halogen substituent (-X) contains 0 carbon atoms. Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The only common and stable functional group that fits this description is the acetyl group: -C(=O)CH3.\n    *   So, the molecule is a haloacetophenone. It consists of a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom and one acetyl group.\n\n*   **Step 2: Consider the possible substitution patterns and predict the 1H NMR spectrum.**\n    *   The two substituents can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4).\n    *   The question describes a spectrum with a very simple and symmetrical aromatic region (two doublets), which is highly characteristic of a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern.\n    *   Let's predict the spectrum for a *para*-haloacetophenone (1-acetyl-4-halobenzene):\n        *   **Symmetry:** In a *para*-disubstituted ring, there is a plane of symmetry. This makes the two protons adjacent to the acetyl group chemically equivalent to each other. It also makes the two protons adjacent to the halogen atom chemically equivalent to each other.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons (on the ring):** There are 4 protons on the ring. Because of the symmetry, they will appear as two distinct signals.\n            *   The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group (positions 2 and 6) are equivalent. They are split by their neighbors (at positions 3 and 5), so they will appear as a **doublet** integrating to **2H**.\n            *   The protons ortho to the halogen group (positions 3 and 5) are also equivalent. They are split by their neighbors (at positions 2 and 6), so they will also appear as a **doublet** integrating to **2H**.\n            *   The typical chemical shift for aromatic protons is in the range of 6.5-8.5 ppm. Both the acetyl group and the halogen are electron-withdrawing, so the signals will be in the downfield part of this range (e.g., 7.5-8.0 ppm).\n        *   **Acetyl Group Protons:** The acetyl group (-COCH3) has three protons on its methyl group. These three protons are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (a methyl ketone) is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the predicted spectrum with the given options.**\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** Two doublets (each 2H) in the 7.5-8.0 ppm region, and one singlet (3H) in the 2.1-2.6 ppm region.\n    *   **Option A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This is exactly the pattern we expect for the aromatic protons in a *para*-disubstituted ring (two doublets, each for 2H). The chemical shifts are appropriate.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons at a chemical shift perfect for the methyl of an acetyl group.\n        *   This option perfectly matches our prediction.\n    *   **Option B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts (4.8 and 4.6 ppm) are too low for aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **Option C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum shows signals outside the aromatic region and has incorrect integration and multiplicity for our structure. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **Option D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. The problem implies a ketone (the acetyl group, -COCH3) based on the carbon count. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a *para*-haloacetophenone, and its 1H NMR spectrum is best described by option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
