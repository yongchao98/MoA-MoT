    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System and the Goal:**\n    The system consists of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (`d > R`). The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential, which we can set to zero (V=0). The goal is to calculate the total potential energy `U` of this system.\n\n2.  **Choose a Method of Solution:**\n    This is a classic electrostatics problem that is most easily solved using the **method of images**. This method allows us to replace the complex problem of a charge and a conductor (with an unknown induced surface charge distribution) with a simpler problem of two point charges.\n\n3.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    *   The electric field *outside* the grounded conducting sphere can be exactly replicated by removing the sphere and placing an \"image charge,\" `q'`, at a specific location inside the sphere's original volume.\n    *   The condition is that the potential created by the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must be zero on the surface where the sphere was (i.e., at a radius `R`).\n    *   Through a standard derivation (or by recalling the result), the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` (distance from the center) are found to be:\n        *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n        *   Image charge position: `d' = R^2 / d` (located on the line connecting the center and `q`).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere. As the charge `q` is brought closer, it induces charge on the sphere, which in turn exerts a force on `q`. The potential energy is the work done against this force.\n\n    There are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n    **Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n    *   The force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center of the sphere is equal to the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)` at its position `d'(x)`.\n    *   At a position `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = - (R/x) * q` and its position is `d'(x) = R^2/x`.\n    *   The distance between `q` (at `x`) and `q'` (at `R^2/x`) is `x - R^2/x`.\n    *   The force on `q` is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = - (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\n    *   The potential energy `U` is the work done *by an external agent* to bring the charge from infinity to `d`. This is `U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`.\n    *   `U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [- (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = k * q^2 * R ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    *   To solve the integral, we use u-substitution: let `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R * (1/2) ∫ du/u^2 = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/u]`\n    *   Evaluating the integral from `x = ∞` to `x = d` (which corresponds to `u = ∞` to `u = d^2 - R^2`):\n    *   `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/(d^2 - R^2) - (-1/∞)] = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/(d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    **Method 2: Using the `U = (1/2)qV` Formula**\n    *   The total electrostatic energy of a system of conductors and charges is `U = (1/2) ∑ q_i * V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges.\n    *   In our system, we have the point charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere.\n    *   The potential of the sphere is `V_sphere = 0` (it's grounded), so its contribution to the sum is zero.\n    *   The only term left is `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`, where `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of `q` due to the induced charge on the sphere.\n    *   This potential `V_at_q` is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n    *   `V_at_q = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    *   The distance is `d - d' = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n    *   `V_at_q = k * (-R/d * q) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = - (k * q * R) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   Now, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q = (1/2) * q * [- (k * q * R) / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both methods yield the same result. The potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, and energy is released as the charge is brought in from infinity.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated expression `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
