    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n    *   We have two inertial frames of reference.\n        *   Frame S: The Galaxy's reference frame (considered \"stationary\").\n        *   Frame S': The supernova ejecta's reference frame (considered \"moving\").\n    *   The relative speed `v` between the two frames is given as 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time interval is measured in the ejecta's frame (S'). This is the *proper time*, `Δt₀`, because the start and end of the time measurement happen at the same place in this frame (i.e., on the ejecta). So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n2.  **Determine the Physical Principle to Apply:**\n    *   The speed of the ejecta, `v = 60,000 km/s`, is a significant fraction of the speed of light `c`.\n    *   The ratio `v/c` = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2.\n    *   Since the speed is 20% of the speed of light, the effects of special relativity are not negligible. Classical mechanics (`distance = speed × time`) will not give the correct answer.\n    *   The core concept here is **time dilation**. A clock in the moving frame (the ejecta) will appear to run slower when measured from the stationary frame (the Galaxy).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation Plan:**\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). The formula for this is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   We are given the proper time `Δt₀ = 50 s`. We need to find the corresponding dilated time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   The time dilation formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n    *   The Lorentz factor, `γ` (gamma), is given by the formula: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   So, the steps are:\n        1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n        2.  Use `γ` and `Δt₀` to find the dilated time `Δt`.\n        3.  Use `Δt` and `v` to find the distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   It is most efficient to combine the formulas first: `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   The term `v * Δt₀` is the distance that would be calculated classically: `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This is option A, but it's incorrect because it ignores relativity.\n    *   Now let's calculate the full relativistic distance. I will use a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\nc = 300000 # km/s\ndelta_t0 = 50 # seconds\n\n# Calculate the squared ratio of v/c\nbeta_squared = (v / c)**2\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# Calculate the dilated time in the Galaxy's frame\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t0\n\n# Calculate the distance in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n<execute_result>\n3061862.178478446\n</execute_result>\n\n5.  **Analyze the Result and Conclude:**\n    *   The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n    *   Let's compare this to the given options:\n        *   A) 3,000,000 km\n        *   B) 2,940,000 km\n        *   C) 2,880,000 km\n        *   D) 3,060,000 km\n    *   The calculated value of 3,061,862 km is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows: Due to time dilation, from the Galaxy's perspective, more than 50 seconds have passed while the ejecta's clock measured 50 seconds. This longer time interval, when multiplied by the ejecta's speed, results in a longer distance traveled compared to the classical calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S). This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we are measuring the distance.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S'). This is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Values:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s` (standard value).\n    *   The time interval is measured in the ejecta's frame, `Δt' = 50 s`. Since this time is measured in the moving frame where the clock is at rest, this is the *proper time*, often denoted as `Δt₀`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Relevant Physics Principle:**\n    *   The velocity `v` is a significant fraction of the speed of light `c` (`v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`). Therefore, we must use the principles of Special Relativity, specifically **time dilation**.\n    *   Time dilation states that an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for an event that takes a shorter time (`Δt₀`) in a moving frame (the ejecta).\n\n4.  **Formulate the Equations:**\n    *   The distance traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   The time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   The Lorentz factor, `γ` (gamma), is calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Values:**\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.02062`\n    *   Next, calculate the dilated time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n    *   Finally, calculate the distance `d` traveled in the Galaxy's frame:\n        `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,860 km.\n    *   The option that is closest to this value is D) 3,060,000 km.\n\nThe non-relativistic calculation would simply be `d = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option A), which is incorrect because it ignores the effects of time dilation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
