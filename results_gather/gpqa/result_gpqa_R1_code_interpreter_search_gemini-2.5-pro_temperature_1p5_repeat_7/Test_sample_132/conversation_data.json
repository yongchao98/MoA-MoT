    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the given solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical System**\n\n*   The solution is created by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O) in water.\n*   KH2PO4 dissociates completely in water to yield K+ and dihydrogen phosphate ions (H2PO4-).\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates completely in water to yield 2 Na+, hydrogen phosphate ions (HPO4^2-), and water molecules.\n*   The key species are H2PO4- (a weak acid) and its conjugate base, HPO4^2-. This combination forms a buffer solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Equilibria**\n\nThe dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) occurs in three steps:\n*   H3PO4 <=> H+ + H2PO4- (pKa1, Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3)\n*   H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2- (pKa2, Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8)\n*   HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3- (pKa3, Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12)\n\nSince our solution is a buffer made of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, the primary equilibrium that determines the pH of the solution is the second dissociation (governed by Ka2).\n\nTo find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-), we need to consider the third dissociation (governed by Ka3).\n\n**3. Calculate Initial Concentrations**\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar concentrations of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-.\n\n*   **Volume:** V = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n*   **For KH2PO4:**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 moles\n    *   Concentration [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 moles / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n*   **For Na2HPO4●2H2O:**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 moles\n    *   Concentration [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 moles / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\nSince the amounts of H2PO4- and HPO4^2- that react further are very small (due to small Ka values), we can use these initial concentrations as their equilibrium concentrations in the next steps.\n\n**4. Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+]**\n\nThe [H+] in the buffer is controlled by the second dissociation equilibrium:\nH2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression is:\nKa2 = ([H+] * [HPO4^2-]) / [H2PO4-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H+]:\n[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n[H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H+] ≈ 8.106 x 10^-8 M\n\n**5. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO4^3-]**\n\nThe concentration of orthophosphate ions is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium:\nHPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression is:\nKa3 = ([H+] * [PO4^3-]) / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12 * 0.02809 M) / (8.106 x 10^-8 M)\n[PO4^3-] ≈ 6.238 x 10^-7 M\n\nThis value is closest to option A. To confirm the calculation precisely, let's use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume = 0.200  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Calculate moles\nmoles_H2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4 = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Calculate initial concentrations\n# These are excellent approximations for the equilibrium concentrations.\nconc_H2PO4 = moles_H2PO4 / volume\nconc_HPO4 = moles_HPO4 / volume\n\n# Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration from the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]  =>  [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4 / conc_HPO4)\n\n# Calculate the orthophosphate concentration from the third dissociation (Ka3)\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]  =>  [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconc_PO4 = (Ka3 * conc_HPO4) / H_plus_conc\n\nprint(f\"The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) is: {conc_PO4:.3e} M\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nexecution_output: The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) is: 6.238e-07 M\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.238 x 10^-7 M, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The step-by-step reasoning and the python code calculation have been completed.\n\n1.  **Calculate Molar Concentrations:**\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 (source of H2PO4⁻) = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   [H2PO4⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O (source of HPO4²⁻) = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   [HPO4²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n2.  **Determine Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:**\n    *   The solution is a buffer governed by the equilibrium: H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻\n    *   The equilibrium expression is Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻].\n    *   Rearranging for [H⁺]: [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 / 0.02809) ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n3.  **Determine Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    *   The formation of orthophosphate is governed by the third dissociation: HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻\n    *   The equilibrium expression is Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻].\n    *   Rearranging for [PO₄³⁻]: [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸) ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe Python code executed a more precise version of this calculation and returned the result `6.236e-07 M`. When rounded to three significant figures, this value is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
