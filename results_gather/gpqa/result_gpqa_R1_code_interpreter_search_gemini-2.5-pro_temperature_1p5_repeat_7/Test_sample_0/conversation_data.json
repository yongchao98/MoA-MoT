    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The problem relates the lifetime of a quantum state to the uncertainty in its energy. This relationship is described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n2.  **State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is greater than or equal to a fundamental constant. The time uncertainty (Δt) is equivalent to the lifetime of the state (τ). The formula is:\n    ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ\n    where ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant. The uncertainty ΔE represents the natural linewidth, or the inherent \"fuzziness,\" of the energy level. A shorter lifetime leads to a larger energy uncertainty.\n\n3.  **Determine the Condition for \"Clearly Resolved\":** For two energy levels, E₁ and E₂, to be clearly resolved or distinguished, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than their energy uncertainties. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy uncertainty, and this broader line will be the limiting factor for resolution. Therefore, the energy difference must be at least on the order of the larger of the two linewidths (ΔE).\n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE_larger\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainties (Linewidths):** We need to calculate ΔE for each state using the formula ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n    *   **Value of ħ:** The reduced Planck constant, ħ, is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Identify the Limiting Factor:**\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n    *   The larger energy uncertainty is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This corresponds to the state with the shorter lifetime. To resolve the two levels, their energy separation must be greater than this value.\n    *   Required Condition: |E₁ - E₂| > 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:** Now, let's check which of the provided options satisfies this condition.\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (This is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV   (This is much larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV   (This is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV   (This is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Only option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, provides an energy difference significantly larger than the broader energy linewidth (ΔE₁). An energy difference this large would ensure that the two energy levels are well-separated and can be clearly distinguished. The other options represent energy differences that are smaller than the linewidth of the first state, meaning the levels would overlap and be unresolvable.\n\nWe can use a python script for a more precise calculation.\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (natural linewidth) for each state using the formula Delta_E = hbar / tau\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# To resolve two energy levels, their energy difference must be larger than their linewidths.\n# The critical factor is the broader line, which corresponds to the shorter lifetime.\nlarger_linewidth = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.2e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.2e} eV\")\nprint(f\"The larger linewidth is: {larger_linewidth:.2e} eV\")\nprint(\"\\nTo be clearly resolved, the energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than the larger linewidth.\")\nprint(\"We need |E1 - E2| > {:.2e} eV\".format(larger_linewidth))\n\n# Let's check the given options:\noptions = {'A': 1e-11, 'B': 1e-4, 'C': 1e-9, 'D': 1e-8}\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > larger_linewidth:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\")\n\n```\nEnergy uncertainty of state 1 (ΔE1): 6.58e-07 eV\nEnergy uncertainty of state 2 (ΔE2): 6.58e-08 eV\nThe larger linewidth is: 6.58e-07 eV\n\nTo be clearly resolved, the energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than the larger linewidth.\nWe need |E1 - E2| > 6.58e-07 eV\nOption A (1.0e-11 eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\nOption B (1.0e-04 eV) is a possible energy difference.\nOption C (1.0e-09 eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\nOption D (1.0e-08 eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The reasoning process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem connects the lifetime of a quantum state to the uncertainty in its energy. This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n2.  **Formulate the principle:** The uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) must be greater than or equal to a constant. For an unstable state, the lifetime (τ) can be taken as the uncertainty in time (Δt). The relationship is often approximated as:\n    ΔE ⋅ τ ≈ ħ\n    where ΔE is the energy uncertainty or \"natural linewidth\" of the energy level, τ is its lifetime, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n3.  **Determine the condition for resolution:** For two energy levels, E₁ and E₂, to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than their individual energy uncertainties (linewidths). The state with the shorter lifetime will have a larger energy uncertainty, and this broader linewidth is the limiting factor for resolving the two levels. Therefore, the energy separation must be greater than the larger of the two linewidths.\n    |E₁ - E₂| > max(ΔE₁, ΔE₂)\n\n4.  **Calculate the energy uncertainties:**\n    *   For the first state (τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s):\n        ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   For the second state (τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s):\n        ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Identify the larger linewidth:** Comparing the two uncertainties, ΔE₁ (≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is larger than ΔE₂ (≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV). This is the minimum energy separation required for the levels to be resolved.\n    So, we need |E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the options against the condition:**\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Only option B provides an energy difference large enough to clearly resolve the two states, as it is the only value greater than the broader energy linewidth of ~6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The Python code execution confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
