    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Limiting Magnitude for ESPRESSO**\n\nThe first step is to figure out the faintest apparent V magnitude (m_V) a star can have to be considered \"detectable\" by ESPRESSO under the specified conditions.\n\n*   **Condition for \"Detectable\":** Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N) ≥ 10.\n*   **Exposure Time:** 1 hour (3600 seconds).\n*   **Telescope Configuration:** ESPRESSO coupled with one 8m VLT (this implies the \"1-UT\" mode).\n\nThe ESPRESSO overview provides performance examples for the 1-UT high-resolution mode:\n*   A star with V=12 (m_ref) requires 1 hour to reach an S/N of 70 (SNR_ref).\n\nThe Signal-to-Noise ratio for observations limited by photon noise from the source (which is a good approximation for moderately faint stars with long exposures on large telescopes) scales with the square root of the incoming flux (F).\n*   S/N ∝ sqrt(F)\n\nThe flux (F) is related to apparent magnitude (m) by F ∝ 10^(-0.4 * m). Therefore:\n*   S/N ∝ sqrt(10^(-0.4 * m))\n*   S/N ∝ 10^(-0.2 * m)\n\nWe can set up a ratio to find the limiting magnitude (m_limit) that gives our target S/N of 10 (SNR_target):\n(SNR_ref / SNR_target) = 10^(-0.2 * m_ref) / 10^(-0.2 * m_limit)\n(SNR_ref / SNR_target) = 10^(-0.2 * (m_ref - m_limit))\n\nSolving for m_limit:\nlog10(SNR_ref / SNR_target) = -0.2 * (m_ref - m_limit)\nm_limit = m_ref + (log10(SNR_ref / SNR_target) / 0.2)\nm_limit = m_ref + 5 * log10(SNR_ref / SNR_target)\n\nPlugging in the known values:\nm_limit = 12 + 5 * log10(70 / 10) = 12 + 5 * log10(7) ≈ 12 + 5 * 0.845 = 16.225\n\nSo, a star is detectable if its apparent V magnitude is approximately **m_V ≤ 16.2** and it is visible from the observatory.\n\n**2. Check Visibility from Paranal Observatory**\n\n*   **Location:** Paranal Observatory, Chile.\n*   **Latitude:** Approximately -24.6° South.\n\nA star is only observable if it rises above the horizon. For a southern observatory, stars with very high positive declinations (i.e., far north celestial pole stars) are never visible. A good rule of thumb is that the declination (DEC) of an object must be less than `90° - |latitude|`.\n*   Visibility Limit: DEC < 90° - 24.6° = 65.4°\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Star**\n\nNow we evaluate each star against the two criteria: visibility (DEC < 65.4°) and brightness (m_V ≤ 16.2).\n\n*   **a) Canopus:**\n    *   I will search for its properties.\n    <search>Canopus apparent magnitude and coordinates</search>\n    <information>\n    *   Apparent magnitude (V): -0.74\n    *   Coordinates (J2000):\n        *   Right ascension (RA): 06h 23m 57s\n        *   Declination (DEC): -52° 41′ 44″ (-52.7°)\n    </information>\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = -52.7°, which is << 65.4°. It is easily visible from Paranal.\n    *   **Brightness:** m_V = -0.74, which is << 16.2.\n    *   **Conclusion: Detectable.**\n\n*   **b) Polaris:**\n    *   I will search for its properties.\n    <search>Polaris apparent magnitude and coordinates</search>\n    <information>\n    *   Apparent magnitude (V): +1.98\n    *   Coordinates (J2000):\n        *   Right ascension (RA): 02h 31m 49s\n        *   Declination (DEC): +89° 15′ 51″ (+89.26°)\n    </information>\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +89.26°, which is not < 65.4°. As the North Star, it is never visible from the Southern Hemisphere.\n    *   **Brightness:** m_V = +1.98. (This doesn't matter as it's not visible).\n    *   **Conclusion: Not Detectable.**\n\n*   **c), d), e), f): Generic Stars**\n    *   These stars are at DEC = 0°, which is on the celestial equator and visible worldwide.\n    *   Their visibility is fine. We need to calculate their apparent magnitude (m_V) from their absolute magnitude (M_V = 15) and distance (d).\n    *   The formula is: m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(d) - 5 = 10 + 5 * log10(d).\n\n    I will use a Python script to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Calculation Summary ---\n\n# 1.

    "Here is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Limiting Magnitude of ESPRESSO\n\nThe problem requires a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 for a 1-hour exposure. We can use the performance example given in the ESPRESSO overview to determine the faintest star (limiting magnitude) that meets this criterion.\n\n*   **Reference Observation:** A star with an apparent magnitude `V = 12` (`m_ref`) achieves `S/N = 70` (`SNR_ref`) in 1 hour.\n*   **Target Observation:** We want to find the magnitude (`m_limit`) that gives `S/N = 10` (`SNR_target`) in the same 1-hour exposure.\n\nThe signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is proportional to the square root of the incoming light flux (F). The flux is related to magnitude (m) by the formula `F ∝ 10^(-0.4m)`. Therefore, `S/N ∝ 10^(-0.2m)`.\n\nWe can set up a ratio:\n`SNR_ref / SNR_target = 10^(-0.2 * m_ref) / 10^(-0.2 * m_limit)`\n\nSolving for `m_limit`:\n`m_limit = m_ref + 5 * log10(SNR_ref / SNR_target)`\n`m_limit = 12 + 5 * log10(70 / 10)`\n`m_limit = 12 + 5 * log10(7)`\n`m_limit ≈ 12 + 5 * 0.845`\n`m_limit ≈ 16.23`\n\nSo, a star is detectable if its apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) is **less than or equal to 16.23**.\n\n### Step 2: Check the Visibility from Paranal Observatory\n\nParanal Observatory is in Chile, in the Southern Hemisphere, at a latitude of approximately -24.6°. A star must rise high enough in the sky to be observed. Stars with very high northern declinations are never visible. A conservative limit for observability is that a star's declination (DEC) must be less than `90° - |latitude|`.\n\n*   `Visibility Limit ≈ 90° - 24.6° = 65.4°`\n\nTherefore, a star is only observable from Paranal if its **DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Star\n\nWe will now check each star against our two criteria: `m_V ≤ 16.23` and `DEC < +65.4°`.\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   `m_V = -0.74`\n*   `DEC = -52.7°`\n*   **Result:** It is much brighter than the limit (`-0.74 ≤ 16.23`) and is easily visible from the southern hemisphere (`-52.7° < 65.4°`). **Detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   `m_V = +1.98`\n*   `DEC = +89.26°`\n*   **Result:** Its declination is too high to be seen from Paranal (`89.26°` is not `< 65.4°`). **Not Detectable.**\n\n**c, d, e, f) Generic Stars**\nThese stars are all at `DEC = 0°`, which is on the celestial equator and is visible from Paranal. We need to calculate their apparent magnitude (`m_V`) using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`, where `M_V = 15` and `d` is the distance in parsecs (pc).\n\n*   **c) Star at 10 pc:**\n    `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5 - 5 = 15.0`\n    *   **Result:** `15.0 ≤ 16.23`. **Detectable.**\n\n*   **d) Star at 200 pc:**\n    `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 2.3 - 5 = 15 + 11.5 - 5 = 21.5`\n    *   **Result:** `21.5` is not `≤ 16.23`. **Not Detectable.**\n\n*   **e) Star at 5 pc:**\n    `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.7 - 5 = 15 + 3.5 - 5 = 13.5`\n    *   **Result:** `13.5 ≤ 16.23`. **Detectable.**\n\n*   **f) Star at 50 pc:**\n    `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.7 - 5 = 15 + 8.5 - 5 = 18.5`\n    *   **Result:** `18.5` is not `≤ 16.23`. **Not Detectable.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe stars that are detectable are:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  Star at 10 pc\n3.  Star at 5 pc\n\nThis gives a total of **3** detectable stars.\n\n<<<B>>>"
