    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is a very strong indication that **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Trace the origin of B:** Substance B (D₂O) is released when a precipitate G is heated. This is a classic dehydration/de-deuteration reaction. This implies that G is a deuterated hydrate or a deuterated hydroxide, which loses D₂O upon heating. For example, a metal hydroxide M(OH)n when heated gives a metal oxide and H₂O. Similarly, M(OD)n would give a metal oxide and D₂O. So, **G is likely a deuterated metal hydroxide, M(OD)n**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the main reaction:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to form the precipitate G and a gas W.\n    *   X + Y → G (precipitate) + W (gas)\n    *   Since G contains Deuterium (D), either X or Y (or both) must contain D. The problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope, which we've identified as D.\n    *   A violent reaction releasing a gas and forming a hydroxide precipitate is characteristic of a reactive metal or metal hydride reacting with water.\n    *   If G is M(OD)n, then the reaction medium Y must be the source of the OD groups. This makes **liquid Y heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n4.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W, produced in the reaction, has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's analyze potential gases from the reaction of a deuterated compound (X) with heavy water (Y=D₂O).\n    *   If X were, for instance, a deuteride like CaD₂, the reaction would be CaD₂ + 2D₂O → Ca(OD)₂ + 2D₂.\n    *   Let's check the gas **D₂ (di-deuterium)**. A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The number of protons equals the number of neutrons. This fits the description of W.\n\n5.  **Identify Substance X:** We have gathered several clues about X:\n    *   It contains Deuterium (D).\n    *   It is a common reagent in organic chemistry, with a \"very close analog\" that is also used. This points towards pairs like LiAlH₄/LiAlD₄ or NaBH₄/NaBD₄.\n    *   It reacts violently with D₂O to produce a precipitate G (a metal hydroxide) and D₂ gas.\n    *   Let's test **X = LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride)**. Its analog is LiAlH₄, a very common and powerful reducing agent.\n        *   The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂\n        *   This reaction is famously violent.\n        *   It produces D₂ gas (W), which we confirmed has N=P.\n        *   It produces a precipitate, **Al(OD)₃ (G)**, as aluminum hydroxide is insoluble. This fits. Sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄) would produce soluble sodium borate, so it's a less likely candidate.\n    *   The final clue is about the reaction with a keto acid. A keto acid has a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group (e.g., R-C(=O)-COOH), containing 3 oxygen atoms. A strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄ will reduce both functional groups to alcohols, resulting in a diol (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains only 2 oxygen atoms. This clue confirms that X is a strong reducing agent.\n\n6.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n7.  **Perform the Calculation:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄). We will use integer mass numbers for the most common/relevant isotopes.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen. The isotope present is Deuterium (²H or D), which has a mass number of 2.\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (Al). The most common isotope is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n    *   The formula unit is LiAlD₄.\n    *   Mass contribution from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is one atom of Al. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Mass contribution from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are four atoms of D. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   The cumulative (summed) mass is the sum of these two values: 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
