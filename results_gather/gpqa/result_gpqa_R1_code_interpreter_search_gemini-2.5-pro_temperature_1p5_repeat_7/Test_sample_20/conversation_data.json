    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structures, called tautomers, can rapidly interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an α-hydrogen (alpha-hydrogen).\n\n2.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone:**\n    *   **Structure:** Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone) is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups opposite each other and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** Let's look at the carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the two carbonyl groups. These alpha carbons are also part of the carbon-carbon double bonds. They are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since benzoquinone has no α-hydrogens, it cannot undergo the standard keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, it does not show tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has multiple α-hydrogens, it can readily undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it exists in equilibrium with its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is aromatic and thus highly stable.\n\n4.  **Decision for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism (B)**\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in molecules that are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reason for chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a central carbon atom (at position 2) bonded to the following four groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since all four groups attached to the carbon at position 2 are different, this carbon is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (they have two non-superimposable mirror images called enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl Fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is derived from fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is planar around the central C=C double bond.\n        ```\n            H       COOCH₃\n             \\     /\n              C = C\n             /     \\\n        CH₃OOC      H\n        ```\n    *   **Chirality Check:** The molecule has no chiral centers. Furthermore, it possesses a center of inversion (a point in the center of the C=C bond) and a plane of symmetry that includes the C=C bond. The presence of any element of symmetry (like a plane or center of inversion) makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Decision for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
