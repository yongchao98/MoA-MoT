    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circle of radius 'a' as the number of sides N becomes infinitely large.\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. It consists of a central bright disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nThe intensity distribution I(θ) in the diffraction pattern is given by:\nI(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁( (2πa/λ) * sin(θ) ) / ( (2πa/λ) * sin(θ) )]²\n\nwhere:\n-   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n-   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n-   `θ` is the angle of diffraction.\n-   `I₀` is the intensity at the center (θ=0).\n-   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first order.\n\nThe minima of the intensity occur when the numerator `J₁( (2πa/λ) * sin(θ) )` is zero (excluding the case where the argument is zero, which corresponds to the central maximum).\n\nLet `j_1,n` be the n-th zero of the `J₁` Bessel function. The condition for the n-th minimum is:\n(2πa/λ) * sin(θₙ) = j_1,n\n\nGiven that the angles are small, we can use the approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n(2πa/λ) * θₙ = j_1,n\nSolving for θₙ, we get the angular position of the n-th minimum:\nθₙ = (j_1,n / (2π)) * (λ/a)\n\nWe need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which corresponds to n=1 and n=2.\nAngular position of the first minimum (n=1):\nθ₁ = (j_1,1 / (2π)) * (λ/a)\n\nAngular position of the second minimum (n=2):\nθ₂ = (j_1,2 / (2π)) * (λ/a)\n\nThe angular distance between them is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\nΔθ = [ (j_1,2 / (2π)) - (j_1,1 / (2π)) ] * (λ/a)\nΔθ = [ (j_1,2 - j_1,1) / (2π) ] * (λ/a)\n\nTo find the numerical value, we need the first two zeros of the J₁ Bessel function.\nj_1,1 ≈ 3.8317\nj_1,2 ≈ 7.0156\n\nNow, let's calculate the coefficient for Δθ:\nCoefficient = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π)\nCoefficient = 3.1839 / (2 * 3.14159)\nCoefficient ≈ 0.5067\n\nSo, the angular distance is:\nΔθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ/a)\n\nThis value is very close to option B.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the well-known formula for the minima of a circular aperture of diameter D = 2a:\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = m * (λ/D)\nwhere the constants 'm' for the first few minima are:\nm₁ ≈ 1.220 (This is j_1,1 / π)\nm₂ ≈ 2.233 (This is j_1,2 / π)\n\nUsing this formulation:\nθ₁ = 1.220 * (λ/D) = 1.220 * (λ/2a) = 0.610 * (λ/a)\nθ₂ = 2.233 * (λ/D) = 2.233 * (λ/2a) = 1.1165 * (λ/a)\n\nThe angular distance is:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.1165 - 0.610) * (λ/a) = 0.5065 * (λ/a)\n\nBoth methods yield a result very close to 0.506 λ/a.\n\nTo confirm the values precisely, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport scipy.special as sp\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Find the first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function of the first kind, J1(x)\nzeros = sp.jn_zeros(1, 2)\nj1_1 = zeros[0]\nj1_2 = zeros[1]\n\n# The formula for the angular distance between the first two minima is:\n# delta_theta = [(j1_2 - j1_1) / (2 * pi)] * (lambda / a)\n# We need to compute the coefficient C = (j1_2 - j1_1) / (2 * pi)\n\ncoefficient = (j1_2 - j1_1) / (2 * np.pi)\n\nprint(f\"{coefficient:.3f}\")\n```\n>>>\n0.507\n<<<B>>>",
    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' will become a circle of radius 'a' as the number of sides N approaches infinity. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe intensity of the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is given by the Airy pattern formula:\nI(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ))) / (k * a * sin(θ)) ]²\nwhere:\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number.\n*   `θ` is the angular position from the central axis.\n*   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n\nThe intensity minima occur when the numerator `J₁(k * a * sin(θ))` is zero, excluding the case where `θ = 0` (which corresponds to the central maximum).\nLet `j_1,n` be the n-th zero of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. The condition for the n-th minimum is:\n`k * a * sin(θₙ) = j_1,n`\n\nUsing the small angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`) and substituting `k = 2π/λ`, we get:\n`(2π/λ) * a * θₙ = j_1,n`\n\nSolving for the angular position of the n-th minimum, `θₙ`:\n`θₙ = (j_1,n / (2π)) * (λ/a)`\n\nWe need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which correspond to `n=1` and `n=2`.\nThe angular position of the first minimum is:\n`θ₁ = (j_1,1 / (2π)) * (λ/a)`\n\nThe angular position of the second minimum is:\n`θ₂ = (j_1,2 / (2π)) * (λ/a)`\n\nThe angular distance between them is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`:\n`Δθ = ( (j_1,2 - j_1,1) / (2π) ) * (λ/a)`\n\nFrom mathematical tables or the executed Python script, we have the first two non-zero zeros of `J₁(x)`:\n`j_1,1 ≈ 3.8317`\n`j_1,2 ≈ 7.0156`\n\nThe Python script calculated the coefficient `C = (j_1,2 - j_1,1) / (2π)`:\n`C = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * 3.14159...) ≈ 3.1839 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.5067`\n\nThe output from the code confirms this, giving `0.507` when rounded to three decimal places.\n\nTherefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is:\n`Δθ ≈ 0.507 * (λ/a)`\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\nFor comparison:\n*   Option C, `0.610 λ/a`, corresponds to the angular position of the first minimum itself: `θ₁ = (j_1,1 / (2π)) * (λ/a) = (3.8317 / 6.2832) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.610 * (λ/a)`.\n*   Option A, `1.220 λ/a`, is `2 * θ₁`. This corresponds to the angular width of the central maximum (the Airy disk).\n\n<<<B>>>"
