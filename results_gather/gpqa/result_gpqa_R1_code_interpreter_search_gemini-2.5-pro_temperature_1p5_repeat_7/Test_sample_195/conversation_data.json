    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    In a closed system, the total energy is conserved. For a relativistic particle moving in a potential field, the total energy of the system ($E_{total}$) is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy ($E_{particle}$) and the potential energy ($U(x)$). This total energy remains constant throughout the motion.\n\n2.  **Define the energies involved.**\n    *   The potential energy of a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law ($F=-kx$) is given by $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle with rest mass $m$ and velocity $v$ is $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light. This energy includes both the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the relativistic kinetic energy ($(\\gamma-1)mc^2$).\n\n3.  **Write the equation for the total conserved energy of the system.**\n    The total energy of the system is:\n    $E_{total} = E_{particle} + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\text{constant}$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the total energy at a point of known conditions.**\n    A convenient point is the maximum amplitude, $x=A$. At this point, the mass momentarily stops, so its velocity is zero ($v=0$).\n    When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0/c)^2}} = 1$.\n    So, the total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    This is the constant total energy for the entire oscillation.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the total energy at the point where the speed is maximum.**\n    The speed is maximum ($v=v_{max}$) when the potential energy is minimum. The potential energy $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ is minimum at the equilibrium position, $x=0$.\n    At $x=0$, let the velocity be $v_{max}$. The Lorentz factor will be $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2}}$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n6.  **Equate the energies and solve for $v_{max}$.**\n    Since energy is conserved, the energy at the maximum amplitude is equal to the energy at the equilibrium position:\n    $\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, we need to express $v_{max}$ in terms of $\\gamma_{max}$. From the definition of the Lorentz factor:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2}}$\n\n    Let's rearrange to solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}}$\n\n    Square both sides:\n    $1 - (v_{max}/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n\n    Isolate the velocity term:\n    $(v_{max}/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n\n    Take the square root and multiply by $c$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}}$\n\n7.  **Substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$ back into the equation for $v_{max}$.**\n    Substitute $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$ into the equation for $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n8.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ matches option C.\n\n    *   A) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$ (Incorrect: wrong signs and missing $c^2$ leading to dimensional error)\n    *   B) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$ (Incorrect: wrong sign and denominator is not squared)\n    *   C) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$ (Correct)\n    *   D) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ (This is the non-relativistic, classical limit)\n\n<<<C>>>"
