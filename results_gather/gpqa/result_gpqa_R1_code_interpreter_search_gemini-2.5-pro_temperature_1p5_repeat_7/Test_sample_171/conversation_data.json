    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct equation:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The problem describes the relative populations of atoms in different energy levels (excitation) in a system assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The relationship that governs this is the **Boltzmann Equation**.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms (`N`) in an excited energy level `b` to the number of atoms in a lower energy level `a` is given by:\n    `N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    Where:\n    *   `N_b`, `N_a` are the populations of levels `b` and `a`.\n    *   `g_b`, `g_a` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE = E_b - E_a` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (`k ≈ 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K`).\n    *   `T` is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to the two stars:** Let's define the ratio of the excited state population to a reference state population as `R`.\n    For star_1 (temperature `T_1`):\n    `R_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n\n    For star_2 (temperature `T_2`):\n    `R_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n    The factors `(g_b / g_a)` and `ΔE` are intrinsic properties of the iron atom's energy levels and are the same for both stars.\n\n4.  **Use the information from the problem:** The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the ratio `R_1` is twice the ratio `R_2`.\n    `R_1 = 2 * R_2`\n\n5.  **Set up the equation and solve:** Substitute the expressions for `R_1` and `R_2` into the relationship from step 4.\n    `(g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [(g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n\n    The `(g_b / g_a)` terms cancel out:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n    To solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n    `ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n\n    Using the properties of logarithms (`ln(exp(x)) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`):\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\n    Now, rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)`:\n    `ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n    Factor out the common term `(ΔE / k)`:\n    `(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n    Combine the terms in the parenthesis using a common denominator `(T_1 * T_2)`:\n    `(ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\n6.  **Substitute the given numerical values:** The problem provides:\n    *   Energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^-23 J`.\n    *   The Boltzmann constant `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K`.\n\n    Calculate the coefficient `(ΔE / k)`:\n    `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^-23 J) / (1.38 x 10^-23 J/K) = 1 K`\n\n    Substitute this value back into the derived equation:\n    `1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n    `[ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\n7.  **Compare with the options:** This final equation matches option B.\n\n    A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ] - Incorrect denominator.\n    B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)] - **Correct.**\n    C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)] - Incorrect sign in the numerator.\n    D) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1] - Incorrect form.\n\n<<<B>>>"
