    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle, meaning its spin quantum number is s = 1/2. The z-component of its spin can be either +ħ/2 (spin up) or -ħ/2 (spin down).\n    *   Its magnetic moment is `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator. The z-component of the magnetic moment is `μ_z = γS_z`.\n    *   The particle is initially \"aligned\" with a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. This means the system is in an energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian `H_initial = -μ · B = -μ_z B = -γB S_z`. The lowest energy state corresponds to the magnetic moment being aligned with the field. In this case, since `γ` is typically positive for particles like protons, a positive `μ_z` (spin up) would be a higher energy state. However, \"aligned\" usually implies the spin projection is along the field direction, so the particle is in the spin-up state along the z-axis.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state vector at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`, which is the eigenstate of `S_z` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`. In the standard basis where `|+z> = [1, 0]` and `|-z> = [0, 1]`, this is the vector `[1, 0]`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Dynamics (t ≥ 0):**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction: `B_new = B * y_hat`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H = -μ · B_new = -μ_y B = -γB S_y`.\n    *   The state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting the Hamiltonian: `U(t) = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ) = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ)`.\n\n3.  **Perform the Quantum Mechanical Calculation:**\n    *   Let's define the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The time evolution operator becomes `U(t) = exp(iωtS_y/ħ)`.\n    *   We need the matrix representation of `S_y` in the `S_z` basis: `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    *   The operator becomes `U(t) = exp(iωt * (ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) = exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y)`.\n    *   Using the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = I*cos(θ) + iσ_k*sin(θ)` for any Pauli matrix `σ_k`, with `θ = ωt/2` and `σ_k = σ_y`:\n        `U(t) = I*cos(ωt/2) + iσ_y*sin(ωt/2)`\n        `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + i*[[0, -i], [i, 0]]*sin(ωt/2)`\n        `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + [[0, 1], [-1, 0]]*sin(ωt/2)`\n        `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]`\n    *   Now, we find the state `|ψ(t)>` by applying this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z> = [1, 0]`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|+z> = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] * [1, 0]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]` (as a column vector).\n        This can be written as `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t)`.\n    *   `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ * <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n    *   First, let's find the action of `S_z` on `|ψ(t)>`:\n        `S_z|ψ(t)> = S_z * (cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>)`\n        Since `S_z|+z> = +ħ/2|+z>` and `S_z|-z> = -ħ/2|-z>`,\n        `S_z|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)*(+ħ/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)*(-ħ/2)|-z>`\n        `S_z|ψ(t)> = (ħ/2) * (cos(ωt/2)|+z> + sin(ωt/2)|-z>)`\n    *   Now we compute the inner product `<ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`:\n        `<ψ(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ(t)>`, which is `cos(ωt/2)<+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|`.\n        `<S_z>(t) = (cos(ωt/2)<+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|) * (ħ/2) * (cos(ωt/2)|+z> + sin(ωt/2)|-z>)`\n        Using the orthogonality of the basis states (`<+z|+z> = 1`, `<-z|-z> = 1`, `<+z|-z> = 0`), we get:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2)]`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, with `θ = ωt/2`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`\n    *   The term `cos(ωt)` shows that the value oscillates in time. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω`.\n    *   Recalling our definition from step 3, `ω = γB`.\n    *   Therefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n6.  **Alternative Viewpoint (Larmor Precession):**\n    *   This physical situation is a textbook example of Larmor precession.\n    *   A magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` experiences a torque `τ = μ x B`. This torque causes the angular momentum vector `S` to precess around the magnetic field vector `B`.\n    *   The equation of motion is `dS/dt = γS x B`. This describes a precession with an angular frequency `ω_L = γB`, known as the Larmor frequency.\n    *   In this problem, the initial spin is along the Z-axis, and the magnetic field is along the Y-axis. The spin vector will precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane.\n    *   The projection of the precessing spin vector onto the Z-axis will vary as `cos(ω_L*t)`.\n    *   Thus, the z-component of the spin (and the magnetic moment) oscillates with the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`. This classical picture gives the same result as the full quantum mechanical calculation.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both the detailed quantum calculation and the physical intuition from Larmor precession show that the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `γB`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
