    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis:\n**Reaction:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is a ketone. It can act as a nucleophile after deprotonation.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which is a classic Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael addition**. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which will then act as a nucleophile and attack the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) removes an acidic α-proton from the ketone.\n    *   Let's examine the structure of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one:\n        *   The carbonyl group is at position C1.\n        *   The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n        *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n        *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at C6. The strong base t-BuOK abstracts the proton from C6 to form the corresponding enolate. This enolate is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The reaction results in the addition of a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group to the C6 position of the ketone.\n\n4.  **Naming the Product (A):**\n    *   The resulting molecule has an ester as the highest priority functional group. Thus, it will be named as a derivative of `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring system is a substituent on the C3 position of the ethyl propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the substituent, we number the cyclohexane ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C6) as the new C1.\n        *   New C1 (Old C6) has a methyl group.\n        *   New C2 (Old C1) has an oxo (=O) group.\n        *   New C3 (Old C2) has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   The name of the substituent is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n5.  **Comparing with Options:**\n    *   This name matches the structure for product A in options **A** and **D**.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n**Reaction:** 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of KOH and H₂O.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) has acidic protons on the carbon adjacent to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group (the α-carbon). It will act as the nucleophile precursor.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as crotononitrile, is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base used to deprotonate the nitroalkane.\n    *   This is also a **Michael addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂-CH₂-NO₂) to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n    *   The nucleophile is `CH₃CH₂-C(-)H-NO₂`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The carbanion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. Let's identify the carbons in but-2-enenitrile: `CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is the one bearing the methyl group.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n4.  **Naming the Product (B):**\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) is the principal functional group. The molecule will be named as a `...nitrile`.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is numbered starting from the nitrile C as C1.\n        `CN(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH(CH₃)(C3)-CH(NO₂)(C4)-CH₂(C5)-CH₃(C6)`\n    *   The parent chain is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n5.  **Comparing with Options:**\n    *   This name matches the structure for product B in options **A** and **B**.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two conclusions, we find that only option A provides the correct structures for both products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
