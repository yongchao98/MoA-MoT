    "*   **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of Compound X from the provided spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **3400–2500 cm-1 (broad):** This very broad peak is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded.\n        *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1:** These peaks are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring.\n\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A very downfield, broad singlet is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, causing them to be deshielded (shifted downfield). The protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent.\n        *   **Analyzing the Alkyl Substituent:**\n            *   We need to piece together the remaining signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a single proton (-CH). This gives the fragment: -CH-CH3.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2). This gives the fragment: -CH2-CH3.\n            *   **Assembling the fragments:** The remaining signals are 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) for the -CH and 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) for the -CH2. Connecting the two fragments gives the structure: -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. This is a *sec*-butyl group.\n            *   The proton at 2.9 ppm is the methine (-CH) proton. It's the most downfield alkyl proton because it is directly attached to the aromatic ring (a benzylic position). Its signal is a multiplet because it is coupled to the 3 protons of the methyl group and the 2 protons of the methylene group (1+3+2=6 neighbors, so a sextet, often appearing as a multiplet).\n        *   **Conclusion from NMR:** Compound X has a para-disubstituted benzene ring, with one substituent being a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and the other being a *sec*-butyl group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on the combined spectral data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\n\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of carboxylic acids to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically, the -COOH group is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Reaction Equation:**\n        R-COOH + 6 HI --(Red P)--> R-CH3 + 3 H2O + 3 I2\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the final product.**\n\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3). The *sec*-butyl group and the aromatic ring are unaffected by these conditions.\n    *   **Final Product:** The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Match the product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The alkyl group is incorrect (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n    *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - The structure is completely different.\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the predicted product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
