    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n*   The notation `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial NN system (`NN_i`).\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0` (total spin).\n*   `L` is 'S', which means `L_i = 0` (total orbital angular momentum).\n*   `J` is 0, so `J_i = 0` (total angular momentum).\n\nWe also need the initial isospin, `T_i`. The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two identical fermions (like two nucleons) states that the total wavefunction `Ψ_total = Ψ_spatial * Ψ_spin * Ψ_isospin` must be antisymmetric upon exchange of the two particles.\n*   The symmetry of the spatial part is `(-1)^L`. For `L_i = 0`, it's symmetric.\n*   The symmetry of the spin part for two spin-1/2 particles is symmetric for `S=1` (triplet) and antisymmetric for `S=0` (singlet). For `S_i = 0`, it's antisymmetric.\n*   The symmetry of the isospin part is symmetric for `T=1` (triplet) and antisymmetric for `T=0` (singlet).\n*   For the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric: `(symmetric)_spatial * (antisymmetric)_spin * (Ψ_isospin)` must be antisymmetric. This requires `Ψ_isospin` to be symmetric, which corresponds to `T_i = 1`.\n\nSo, the initial state is `1S0` with `J_i=0`, Parity `P_i = +1`, and `T_i = 1`.\n\nThe problem provides a formula which is a consequence of this principle: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is equivalent to `L+S+T` being an odd integer. For the initial state `1S0`: `L_i=0, S_i=0`, so `0+0+T_i` must be odd, which confirms `T_i` must be odd (`T_i=1`).\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe process is `NN_i -> NN_f + X`.\n*   `NN_f` is the final two-nucleon state, given in each option. We are told `T(NN)_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1` and is emitted in an orbital angular momentum state `l_X` (`s` for 0, `p` for 1, etc.).\n\nWe must apply three conservation laws and the Pauli principle for the final state.\n\n**I. Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:**\nThe problem states `T(NN)_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\nGiven `T(NN)_f = 0`, we have `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\nThis means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\nTherefore, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number. This is our first selection rule.\n\n**II. Parity Conservation:**\n`P_initial = P_final`\n*   `P_initial = P(NN_i) = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`. (We can ignore the intrinsic parities of the nucleons as they appear on both sides).\n*   `P_final = P(NN_f) * P_X = ((-1)^{L_f}) * (P_X_intrinsic * (-1)^{l_X})`.\n*   Given `P_X_intrinsic = -1`, we have `P_final = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`.\n*   So, `+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`.\n*   This simplifies to `(-1)^{L_f + l_X} = -1`.\n*   Therefore, `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number. This is our second selection rule.\n\n**III. Angular Momentum Conservation:**\n`J_i = J_f + j_X` (vector sum), where `j_X` is the total angular momentum of particle X.\n*   `J_i = 0`. This implies `J_f` and `j_X` must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (`J_f = j_X`).\n*   The total angular momentum of X is `j_X = l_X + s_X` (vector sum), where `s_X` is the spin of X.\n*   Let's check isospin conservation: `T_i = T_f + t_X` (vector sum). `1 = 0 + t_X`, so `t_X=1`. Particle X must have isospin 1. The lightest such particles are pions, which are pseudoscalar bosons (`P=-1, s_X=0`). Assuming X is a pion-like particle, its spin is `s_X=0`.\n*   If `s_X = 0`, then `j_X = l_X`. The conservation law becomes `J_f = l_X`. This is our third selection rule.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will test each option against the three derived selection rules:\n1.  `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n2.  `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n3.  `J_f = l_X`.\n\n| Option | Final State `NN_f`: `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)` | Particle `X`: `l_X` | Rule 1: `S_f+L_f`=odd? | Rule 2: `L_f+l_X`=odd? | Rule 3: `J_f=l_X`? | Permitted? |\n|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| A) | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p` | `S_f=1, L_f=0, J_f=1` | `l_X=1` | `1+0=1` (Yes) | `0+1=1` (Yes) | `1=1` (Yes) | **Permitted** |\n| B) | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` | `S_f=1, L_f=1, J_f=0` | `l_X=0` | `1+1=2` (No) | `1+0=1` (Yes) | `0=0` (Yes) | **Not Permitted** |\n| C) | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f` | `S_f=1, L_f=2, J_f=3` | `l_X=3` | `1+2=3` (Yes) | `2+3=5` (Yes) | `3=3` (Yes) | **Permitted** |\n| D) | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p` | `S_f=3, L_f=2, J_f=1` | `l_X=1` | `3+2=5` (Yes) | `2+1=3` (Yes) | `1=1` (Yes) | **Not Permitted** |\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\n*   Options A and C satisfy all three selection rules and are therefore permitted transitions.\n*   Option B violates Rule 1 (`S_f + L_f` must be odd, but `1+1=2` is even). This rule stems directly from the Pauli principle as applied to the final `T_f=0` state. Therefore, this transition is not permitted.\n*   Option D appears to satisfy all three selection rules. However, the final state `7D1` requires the two-nucleon system to have a total spin of `S_f=3` (since `2S_f+1=7`). A system of two nucleons (which are spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. A spin of `S=3` is impossible. Thus, the final state is unphysical, and the reaction is forbidden for this fundamental reason.\n\nWe have two forbidden transitions, B and D. However, the question asks us to use the Pauli statistics and conservation laws. The transition in B is forbidden specifically by the Pauli principle requirement. The issue with D is the impossibility of the state itself, which is a piece of external knowledge not derived from the conservation laws of the reaction. In such problems, the violation of a specific rule given or implied in the problem statement is typically the intended answer. Option B is the only one that violates the selection rules governing the process.\n\n<<<B>>>"
