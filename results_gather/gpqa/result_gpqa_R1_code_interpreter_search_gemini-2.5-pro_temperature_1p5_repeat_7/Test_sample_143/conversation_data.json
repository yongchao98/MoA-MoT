    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the mean decay distance (or decay length) of the meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical quantities and formulas.**\n    The mean decay distance, $L$, is given by the product of the particle's velocity, $v$, and its mean lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau$:\n    $L = v \\tau$\n\n    The lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau$, is related to the proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$ (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame), by the time dilation formula from special relativity:\n    $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    where $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}$ is the Lorentz factor, $E_X$ is the total energy, and $m_X$ is the rest mass of the particle.\n\n    The proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$, is related to the decay width, $\\Gamma_X$, by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Combine the formulas.**\n    Substituting the expressions for $\\tau$ and $\\tau_0$ into the equation for $L$, we get:\n    $L = v (\\gamma \\tau_0) = v \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n    It is more convenient to work with the relativistic momentum, $p$. We know that $p = \\gamma m_X v$ and the total energy $E_X = \\gamma m_X c^2$.\n    The velocity is $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta$ is the speed relative to the speed of light, $c$.\n    So, $L = (\\beta c) \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} = \\gamma\\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n\n    We can express $\\gamma\\beta$ in terms of energy and mass. The relativistic energy-momentum relation is:\n    $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$\n    So, $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$.\n\n    Also, from $E_X = \\gamma m_X c^2$ and $pc = \\gamma \\beta m_X c^2$, we have:\n    $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2}$\n\n    Therefore, the final formula for the mean decay distance is:\n    $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\times \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n3.  **Plug in the given values.**\n    We are given:\n    *   $E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} = 8000 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} = 1200 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n    We will use the standard value for the physical constant $\\hbar c$:\n    *   $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (where $1 \\, \\text{fm} = 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$)\n\n4.  **Calculate the result.**\n    First, let's calculate the momentum term factor:\n    $\\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{(8000 \\, \\text{MeV})^2 - (1200 \\, \\text{MeV})^2}}{1200 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{64,000,000 - 1,440,000}}{1200} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62,560,000}}{1200} \\approx \\frac{7909.488}{1200} \\approx 6.59124$\n\n    Next, let's calculate the proper decay length, $c\\tau_0$:\n    $\\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X} = \\frac{197.327 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{320 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx 0.61665 \\, \\text{fm}$\n\n    Finally, multiply these two results to get the mean decay distance $L$:\n    $L \\approx 6.59124 \\times 0.61665 \\, \\text{fm} \\approx 4.0645 \\, \\text{fm}$\n\n    Since $1 \\, \\text{fm} = 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$, the mean decay distance is:\n    $L \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n\nTo obtain a more precise value, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants and given values in MeV and fm\n# hbar*c in MeV*fm\nhbar_c = 197.3269804\n\n# Given values in MeV\nE_X = 8000  # Energy of the meson\nm_X = 1200  # Mass of the meson\nGamma_X = 320  # Width of the meson resonance\n\n# Calculate pc (momentum * c) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2\npc = math.sqrt(E_X**2 - m_X**2)\n\n# Calculate the proper decay length (c * tau_0 = hbar*c / Gamma_X)\nc_tau0 = hbar_c / Gamma_X\n\n# The mean decay distance L is given by L = (pc / (m*c^2)) * c*tau_0 * c (where m*c^2 is just m_X here)\n# or L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0\n# gamma * beta = pc / (m*c^2)\nfactor = pc / m_X\nL_fm = factor * c_tau0\n\n# Convert the result from femtometers to meters (1 fm = 10^-15 m)\nL_m = L_fm * 1e-15\n\nprint(f\"{L_m:.4e}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n4.0645e-15\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation yields $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.
