    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze and identify hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon. Let its general formula be CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. Let's convert this percentage to a fraction: 14.28% ≈ 14.28 / 100 ≈ 1/7.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed using the atomic masses of Carbon (≈12 amu) and Hydrogen (≈1 amu): Mass fraction (H) = `(y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)`.\n    *   Setting this equal to 1/7: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   Cross-multiplying gives: `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   This means the empirical formula of Z is (CH2)n, and its molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as being widely used as a solvent. The most common and simple cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, C6H12. This fits the CnH2n formula with n=6. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze and identify mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Let's call them Y1 and Y2.\n    *   Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X on a heated platinum catalyst.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, let's say Y1 = cyclohexane.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic. Cyclohexane is saturated.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n        *   Hydrogenating Y1 (cyclohexane) will yield cyclohexane.\n        *   Hydrogenating Y2 must also yield cyclohexane (C6H12). This means Y2 must have a C6 carbon skeleton.\n    *   The reaction of an unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon on a platinum catalyst to yield a mixture of an aromatic compound and a saturated cycloalkane is a well-known disproportionation reaction (specifically, a Zelinaky irreversible catalysis). For a C6 system, this reaction produces benzene and cyclohexane.\n    *   This suggests that Y2 is benzene (C6H6). Let's check if this fits the facts:\n        *   Benzene is a liquid.\n        *   Benzene does not decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Hydrogenation of benzene under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature with a catalyst like Pt) yields cyclohexane: C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12.\n    *   Therefore, the conclusion that mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12) is very well-supported.\n\n3.  **Determine the composition of mixture X.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    *   It undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y:\n        X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2\n        X1 + X2 → C6H6 + C6H12\n    *   A chemical reaction, including disproportionation, must conserve the number of atoms of each element. By balancing the hydrogen atoms:\n        Total H atoms in (X1 + X2) = Total H atoms in (C6H6 + C6H12)\n        Total H atoms = 6 + 12 = 18.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This corresponds to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2. This value is 18.\n\n4.  **Final verification.**\n    *   Let's ensure there exist compounds X1 and X2 that fit the remaining criteria.\n    *   Both X1 and X2 must have a C6 skeleton, as they both hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so at least one (and likely both) of X1 and X2 must be an unsaturated alkene or alkyne.\n    *   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   We need two C6 cyclic hydrocarbons, X1=C6Ha and X2=C6Hb, such that a + b = 18. They must be unsaturated.\n    *   Consider cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n        *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches.\n        *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Cyclohexene has one double bond (not conjugated).\n        *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has two double bonds separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated.\n        *   The disproportionation reaction would be a hydrogen transfer: the diene (C6H8) loses 2 H to become benzene (C6H6), and the monoene (C6H10) gains these 2 H to become cyclohexane (C6H12). This is a chemically plausible reaction:\n            C6H8 + C6H10 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12\n    *   All conditions are met by this model, which confirms our calculation based on atom conservation.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>"
