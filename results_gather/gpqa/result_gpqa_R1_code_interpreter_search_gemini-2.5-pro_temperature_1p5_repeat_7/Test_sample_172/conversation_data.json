    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Principles:** The problem involves uncertainty in position (Δx) and asks for the uncertainty in energy (ΔE). This immediately points to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. There are two relevant forms:\n    *   The position-momentum uncertainty principle: Δx Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n    *   The energy-time uncertainty principle: ΔE Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\n2.  **Establish a Relationship between Energy and Momentum Uncertainty:** We need to connect ΔE and Δp. The energy (E) of a particle is a function of its momentum (p). The relationship between small changes (uncertainties) in E and p can be found by taking the derivative of E with respect to p.\n    *   The group velocity of a matter wave is given by v_g = dω/dk.\n    *   Using the de Broglie relations, E = ħω and p = ħk.\n    *   Substituting these into the group velocity equation gives: v_g = d(E/ħ)/d(p/ħ) = dE/dp.\n    *   The velocity of the particle (v) is the group velocity of its wave packet. Therefore, v = dE/dp.\n    *   For small uncertainties, we can approximate this relationship as: ΔE ≈ v * Δp.\n\n    *Self-check:* This relationship holds for both non-relativistic (E = p²/2m) and relativistic (E² = p²c² + m₀²c⁴) particles. In both cases, differentiating E with respect to p yields the particle's velocity, v. Since the electron's speed (2 x 10⁸ m/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light, using this general relationship that covers the relativistic case is correct.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):**\n    *   We use the position-momentum uncertainty principle: Δx Δp ≥ ħ / 2.\n    *   To find the *minimum* uncertainty, we use the equality: Δp_min = ħ / (2 * Δx).\n    *   Often, for order-of-magnitude estimations, the simplified form Δp ≈ ħ / Δx is used. Both will lead to the same order of magnitude. Let's use the more precise form for the calculation.\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    *   Substitute the expression for Δp_min into our uncertainty relation for energy:\n        ΔE_min ≈ v * Δp_min = v * (ħ / (2 * Δx))\n\n5.  **Plug in the Values and Calculate:**\n    *   v = 2 * 10⁸ m/s\n    *   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\n    We will use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values and constants\nv = 2e8  # speed of the electron in m/s\ndelta_x = 0.1e-9  # uncertainty in position in m (0.1 nm)\nhbar = 1.05457e-34  # reduced Planck constant in J*s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (delta_p)\n# using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: delta_p_min = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\ndelta_p_min = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (delta_E)\n# using the relationship delta_E = v * delta_p\ndelta_E_min = v * delta_p_min\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{delta_E_min:.3e}\")\n```\n\nExecution of the code yields the following result:\n```\n1.055e-16\n```\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is `1.055 x 10⁻¹⁶ J`.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated value is ~1 x 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n    *   The options are:\n        A) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n        B) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n        C) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n        D) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n\n    The result matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem is solved using Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between energy, momentum, and velocity.\n\n**1. Identify Relevant Principles:**\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (Position-Momentum):** This principle states that it's impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and exact momentum of a particle. The mathematical relationship for the minimum uncertainty is:\n    Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   Δx is the uncertainty in position.\n    *   Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** The change in a particle's energy (ΔE) is related to the change in its momentum (Δp) by the particle's velocity (v). This can be derived from the group velocity of the matter wave, v = dE/dp. For small uncertainties, we can approximate this as:\n    ΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\n**2. Develop a Calculation Strategy:**\n1.  Use the given uncertainty in position (Δx) to calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp_min) from the Heisenberg principle.\n    Δp_min = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n2.  Use the calculated Δp_min and the given velocity (v) to estimate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE_min).\n    ΔE_min ≈ v * Δp_min = v * (ħ / (2 * Δx))\n\n**3. Perform the Calculation:**\nThe necessary values are:\n*   Velocity (v) = 2 * 10⁸ m/s\n*   Uncertainty in position (Δx) = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10⁻⁹ m = 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nThe code execution performed this calculation:\n*   `delta_p_min = hbar / (2 * delta_x) = (1.05457e-34) / (2 * 0.1e-9) ≈ 5.27e-25 kg*m/s`\n*   `delta_E_min = v * delta_p_min = (2e8) * (5.27e-25) ≈ 1.055e-16 J`\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 1.055 x 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n**4.
