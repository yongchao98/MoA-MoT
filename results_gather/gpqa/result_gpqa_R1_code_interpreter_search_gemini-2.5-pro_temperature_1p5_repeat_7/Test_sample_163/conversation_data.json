    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (`M1_total`) to the total mass of system_2 (`M2_total`). This can be written as the factor `F = M1_total / M2_total`.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information:**\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Orbital Period (`P1`) = 2 years\n    *   Radial velocity amplitude of star A (`K1a`) = 10 km/s\n    *   Radial velocity amplitude of star B (`K1b`) = 5 km/s\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Orbital Period (`P2`) = 1 year\n    *   Radial velocity amplitude of star A (`K2a`) = 15 km/s\n    *   Radial velocity amplitude of star B (`K2b`) = 10 km/s\n\n**3. Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\nFor a binary star system, the total mass (`M_total = m1 + m2`) is related to the orbital period (`P`) and the semi-major axis of the relative orbit (`a`) by Kepler's Third Law:\n`G * M_total = (4 * π^2 * a^3) / P^2`\n\nThe problem provides radial velocity amplitudes (`K`). These are related to the orbital velocities (`v`). The systems are eclipsing, which means we are viewing them nearly edge-on (inclination `i ≈ 90°`, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`). This implies that the observed radial velocity amplitude `K` is essentially equal to the orbital velocity `v`.\n\nThe problem also mentions \"sinusoidal variations,\" which is a key indicator of circular orbits. For a circular orbit, the velocity `v` is related to the orbital radius `r` and period `P` by:\n`v = (2 * π * r) / P`\n\nFor the two stars in a binary system, orbiting their common center of mass:\n`v1 = (2 * π * a1) / P`\n`v2 = (2 * π * a2) / P`\nwhere `a1` and `a2` are the semi-major axes of each star's orbit around the center of mass.\n\nSince `sin(i) ≈ 1`, we have:\n`K1 ≈ v1 = (2 * π * a1) / P`  => `a1 = (K1 * P) / (2 * π)`\n`K2 ≈ v2 = (2 * π * a2) / P`  => `a2 = (K2 * P) / (2 * π)`\n\nThe semi-major axis of the *relative* orbit is `a = a1 + a2`.\n`a = a1 + a2 = (K1 * P) / (2 * π) + (K2 * P) / (2 * π) = ((K1 + K2) * P) / (2 * π)`\n\n**4. Derive the Mass Relationship:**\nNow, substitute the expression for `a` back into Kepler's Third Law:\n`M_total = (4 * π^2 / (G * P^2)) * a^3`\n`M_total = (4 * π^2 / (G * P^2)) * [((K1 + K2) * P) / (2 * π)]^3`\n`M_total = (4 * π^2 / (G * P^2)) * [(K1 + K2)^3 * P^3 / (8 * π^3)]`\n\nSimplifying the expression by canceling terms:\n`M_total = (1 / (2 * π * G)) * P * (K1 + K2)^3`\n\nThis equation shows that the total mass of the system is directly proportional to the orbital period (`P`) and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes (`K1 + K2`).\n`M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)^3`\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of the Masses:**\nWe can now set up the ratio for the two systems. The constant term `1 / (2 * π * G)` will cancel out.\n`M1_total / M2_total = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3]`\n\n**6. Substitute the Values and Compute:**\n*   For System 1:\n    *   `P1 = 2` years\n    *   `K1_sum = K1a + K1b = 10 + 5 = 15` km/s\n*   For System 2:\n    *   `P2 = 1` year\n    *   `K2_sum = K2a + K2b = 15 + 10 = 25` km/s\n\nNow, plug these into the ratio formula:\n`M1_total / M2_total = [2 * (15)^3] / [1 * (25)^3]`\n`M1_total / M2_total = 2 * (15 / 25)^3`\n`M1_total / M2_total = 2 * (3 / 5)^3`\n`M1_total / M2_total = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n`M1_total / M2_total = 54 / 125`\n`M1_total / M2_total = 0.432`\n\nThe calculated factor is 0.432.\n\n**7. Compare with the Options:**\nThe options are:\nA) ~ 0.7\nB) ~ 0.6\nC) ~ 0.4\nD) ~ 1.2\n\nOur calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\nTo verify the calculation, let's use a simple python script.\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1a = 10  # km/s\nK1b = 5   # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1  # years\nK2a = 15  # km/s\nK2b = 10  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocity amplitudes for each system\nK_total_1 = K1a + K1b\nK_total_2 = K2a + K2b\n\n# The total mass is proportional to P * (K_total)^3\n# The proportionality constant cancels out in the ratio.\nmass_prop_1 = P1 * (K_total_1)**3\nmass_prop_2 = P2 * (K_total_2)**3\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the masses\nratio = mass_prop_1 / mass_prop_2\n\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\nThe code confirms the result. System 1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as System 2.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The total mass of a binary star system can be determined from the orbital period and the radial velocity amplitudes of its components, especially when the system is eclipsing (implying an inclination angle `i` close to 90 degrees, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`).\n\nThe relationship derived from Kepler's laws for a spectroscopic binary is:\n`M_total = M1 + M2 = (P / (2 * π * G)) * (K1 + K2)^3`\nwhere:\n*   `M_total` is the total mass of the system.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (`M_sys1`) to the total mass of system_2 (`M_sys2`).\n`Factor = M_sys1 / M_sys2`\n\nUsing the formula above, the constant term `1 / (2 * π * G)` will cancel out in the ratio. Therefore, the ratio can be expressed as:\n`Factor = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3]`\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n**For System 1:**\n*   `P1` = 2 years\n*   `K1a` = 10 km/s\n*   `K1b` = 5 km/s\n*   Sum of velocities: `K1a + K1b = 10 + 5 = 15` km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   `P2` = 1 year\n*   `K2a` = 15 km/s\n*   `K2b` = 10 km/s\n*   Sum of velocities: `K2a + K2b = 15 + 10 = 25` km/s\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n`Factor = [2 * (15)^3] / [1 * (25)^3]`\n`Factor = 2 * (15 / 25)^3`\n`Factor = 2 * (3 / 5)^3`\n`Factor = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n`Factor = 54 / 125`\n`Factor = 0.432`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
