    "*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The question asks about the fundamental symmetries that *must* be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). This means we need to identify the core principles upon which SMEFT is built, distinguishing them from symmetries that might be approximate or violated.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each symmetry:**\n    *   **1. Lorentz Symmetry:** SMEFT is a quantum field theory (QFT) formulated in Minkowski spacetime. A fundamental postulate of QFTs describing particle physics, including the Standard Model and its extensions like SMEFT, is that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers. This is the principle of Lorentz invariance. All terms (operators) in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be constructed to be Lorentz scalars. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry **must be respected**.\n\n    *   **2. Poincare Symmetry:** Poincare symmetry is the full symmetry group of spacetime in special relativity. It includes the Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincare invariance is a foundational assumption in the construction of the Standard Model and SMEFT. This ensures that the outcome of an experiment does not depend on where in spacetime it is performed. Therefore, Poincare symmetry **must be respected**.\n\n    *   **3. CP Symmetry:** CP symmetry is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P). While the electromagnetic and strong interactions of the Standard Model are CP-invariant, the weak interaction is known to violate CP symmetry (as observed in the decay of neutral kaons and B mesons, and described by the CKM matrix). SMEFT is an extension of the *full* Standard Model, including the weak sector. Furthermore, the higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT can introduce new sources of CP violation beyond what is present in the Standard Model. For example, electric dipole moment operators are CP-violating. Therefore, CP symmetry is **not required** to be respected by all SMEFT operators.\n\n    *   **4. CPT Symmetry:** CPT symmetry is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time Reversal (T). The **CPT Theorem** is a fundamental theorem in quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian will automatically have CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT is constructed to be a local and Lorentz-invariant QFT, it must obey the CPT theorem. Therefore, CPT symmetry **must be respected**.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the results:**\n    *   Lorentz Symmetry: Must be respected.\n    *   Poincare Symmetry: Must be respected.\n    *   CP Symmetry: Is not required to be respected.\n    *   CPT Symmetry: Must be respected.\n\n4.  **Match with the given options:** We are looking for the combination of symmetries {1, 2, 4}.\n    *   A) 1, 2, 4 - This matches our conclusion.\n    *   B) 3, 4 - Incorrect, as it includes the violated CP symmetry (3).\n    *   C) 1, 3, 4 - Incorrect, as it includes the violated CP symmetry (3).\n    *   D) 1, 2 - Incomplete, as it omits the fundamental CPT symmetry (4).\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** The correct choice is A, which includes Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<A>>>"
