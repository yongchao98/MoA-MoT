    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which ones are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The absence of any improper axis of rotation (Sₙ), which includes a plane of symmetry (σ, S₁) and a center of inversion (i, S₂), is the condition for chirality.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is ClCH=C(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   This is an alkene. To be chiral, it would generally need a chiral center.\n    *   Let's check the carbon atoms for four different substituents:\n        *   C1: bonded to Cl, H, and C2 (double bond). Not a chiral center.\n        *   C2: bonded to CH₃, CH₂CH₃, and C1 (double bond). Not a chiral center.\n        *   C3: bonded to two H atoms, C2, and C4. Not a chiral center.\n        *   C4: bonded to three H atoms and C3. Not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. The molecule itself is planar about the double bond and possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane containing the double bond). Therefore, it is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name itself specifies the absolute configuration at multiple stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and a double bond (E). This strongly suggests the molecule is a single stereoisomer.\n    *   The parent skeleton, `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione` with (3aR, 7aS) configuration, corresponds to the *exo*-adduct of cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride (with modifications). This parent skeleton, known as *exo*-Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride followed by saturation, has a plane of symmetry and is a meso compound despite having chiral centers.\n    *   However, a substituent `8-(chloromethylene)` which is a `=CHCl` group is placed on the methano bridge (C7 in the corresponding norbornane system).\n    *   This substituent on the bridge lies on the original plane of symmetry of the skeleton. The substituent itself (`=CHCl`) breaks this symmetry because the H and Cl atoms are different. The original plane of symmetry is destroyed.\n    *   Since the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, it is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule is symmetric, as the two ends (HOOC-CH(CH₃)-) are identical.\n    *   When a symmetric molecule has two stereocenters with opposite configurations (R and S), it often results in a meso compound.\n    *   Drawing the molecule (e.g., in a Fischer projection) reveals a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3.\n        ```\n          COOH\n           |\n    CH₃ --|-- H   (R)\n           |\n     H  --|-- CH₃  (S)\n           |\n          COOH\n        ```\n    *   Due to this internal plane of symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image. It is a **meso compound** and thus **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the compound above. Both stereocenters have the same configuration (R,R).\n    *   Drawing the molecule shows no internal plane of symmetry.\n        ```\n          COOH\n           |\n    CH₃ --|-- H   (R)\n           |\n    CH₃ --|-- H   (R)\n           |\n          COOH\n        ```\n    *   Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound, and they are not superimposable. Therefore, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   The name specifies the configuration at C1 as (R). C1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH=CH- (C2), and -CH₂-CH₂- (C6). The paths around the ring from C1 are different.\n    *   Since the molecule is designated as a specific enantiomer (R), it is by definition **chiral** and optically active. It lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The 's' notation indicates that they all have the same relative configuration, meaning they are all on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C₃) and three planes of symmetry (σᵥ). Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH₂ group.\n    *   The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not true chiral centers (they are prochiral) because the two paths around the ring from each of these carbons are identical.\n    *   Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is a cyclopentyl ring attached to a carbonyl group, which is then attached to an isobutyl group: (C₅H₉)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂.\n    *   We check for chiral centers:\n        *   Cyclopentyl ring: all carbons are CH₂, so no chiral centers.\n        *   Chain: The carbon in the CH(CH₃)₂ group is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH₂-C(=O)-... group, and two identical methyl groups. Since two of the attached groups are identical, this is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). It is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compounds that are chiral and will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
