    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as:\n        DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n        DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DBE) and one additional double bond (1 DBE), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   `3420 cm-1` and `3325 cm-1`: The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n    *   `1720 cm-1`: This strong absorption indicates a carbonyl group (C=O). The frequency is typical for an ester that is conjugated with an aromatic ring (which lowers the frequency from the usual ~1740 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   `1.20 ppm (t, 3H)` and `4.5 ppm (q, 2H)`: This triplet-quartet pair is the characteristic pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The chemical shift of the quartet at a high value like 4.5 ppm indicates the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   `4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)`: A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of an amine (-NH2) group. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and exchange with trace amounts of water. This confirms the primary amine found in the IR spectrum.\n    *   `7.0 ppm (d, 2H)` and `8.0 ppm (d, 2H)`: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, signify a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two sets of aromatic protons are coupled to each other. The significant difference in their chemical shifts implies that one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing. The doublet at the lower field (8.0 ppm) is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing group (the ester), while the doublet at the higher field (7.0 ppm) is adjacent to the electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n    1.  We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The two substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    3.  Putting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    4.  Let's verify the molecular formula of this structure: C6H4 (ring) + C (carbonyl) + O + OCH2CH3 + NH2 = C(6+1+2)H(4+5+2)N1O2 = C9H11NO2. The formula matches.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the two -NH peaks in the IR. It would also have a formyl proton (H-C=O) signal in the NMR, which is absent.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex NMR signal in the aromatic region, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data (Molecular formula, DBE, IR, and NMR).\n    *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This compound has a propionate group (CH3CH2COO-), not an ethyl ester group. The -CH2- group next to the carbonyl would appear as a quartet around 2.5-2.8 ppm in the NMR, not at 4.5 ppm.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of all the spectral data, the compound is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
