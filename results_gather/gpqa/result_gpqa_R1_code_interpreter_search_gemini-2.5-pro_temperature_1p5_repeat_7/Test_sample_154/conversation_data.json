    "The user wants to find the uncertainty of the operator $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$, for a quantum system in a given state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n**1. Understand the concepts**\n\nThe uncertainty of an operator A in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is defined by the standard deviation:\n$$ \\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2} $$\nwhere:\n*   $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | A | \\psi \\rangle$ is the expectation value (average) of the operator A.\n*   $\\langle A^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | A^2 | \\psi \\rangle$ is the expectation value of the operator A squared.\n*   $|\\psi\\rangle$ is the state of the system, represented as a column vector (ket).\n*   $\\langle \\psi |$ is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$, represented as a row vector (bra).\n\n**2. Identify the given information**\n\n*   The matrix for the operator $P_z$:\n    Based on the description \"the matrix form of the operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$\", we can write the matrix as:\n    $$ P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n*   The state of the system, $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    The state is given as the column vector:\n    $$ |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n*   The corresponding bra vector, $\\langle\\psi|$:\n    This is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all components are real, it's just the transpose:\n    $$ \\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**3. Step-by-step calculation**\n\n**Step 3.1: Calculate the expectation value of $P_z$, denoted as $\\langle P_z \\rangle$.**\n$$ \\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle $$\nFirst, let's compute the action of the operator $P_z$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$$ P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, we compute the inner product with $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$$ \\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) $$\n$$ \\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right) = \\hbar \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = 0 $$\nSo, $\\langle P_z \\rangle = 0$.\n\n**Step 3.2: Calculate the expectation value of $P_z^2$, denoted as $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.**\nFirst, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$.\n$$ P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, we compute $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$. First, let's apply $P_z^2$ to $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$$ P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, we compute the inner product with $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$$ \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) $$\n$$ \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{2}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} $$\nSo, $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$.\n\n**Step 3.3: Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$.**\nNow we use the uncertainty formula:\n$$ (\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2 $$\n$$ (\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} $$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives the uncertainty:\n$$ \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. This corresponds to option A.\n\nWe can use a python script to verify the calculation.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define hbar as 1 for simplicity and add it back symbolically.\nhbar_val = 1 \nsqrt2 = np.sqrt(2)\n\n# Define the operator P_z\nPz = hbar_val * np.array([\n    [1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, -1]\n])\n\n# Define the state vector |psi>\npsi = np.array([\n    [-1/2],\n    [1/sqrt2],\n    [-1/2]\n])\n\n# Define the bra vector <psi|\npsi_bra = psi.conj().T\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of P_z\n# <P_z> = <psi|Pz|psi>\nexp_Pz = (psi_bra @ Pz @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate the operator P_z^2\nPz_squared = Pz @ Pz\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of P_z^2\n# <P_z^2> = <psi|P_z^2|psi>\nexp_Pz_squared = (psi_bra @ Pz_squared @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate the uncertainty squared\n# (Delta P_z)^2 = <P_z^2> - <P_z>^2\nuncertainty_squared = exp_Pz_squared - exp_Pz**2\n\n# Calculate the uncertainty\nuncertainty = np.sqrt(uncertainty_squared)\n\nprint(f\"Expectation value of Pz is {exp_Pz} * hbar\")\nprint(f\"Expectation value of Pz^2 is {exp_Pz_squared} * hbar^2\")\nprint(f\"Uncertainty Delta Pz is {uncertainty} * hbar\")\nprint(f\"As a fraction, this is hbar/sqrt(2), which is approximately {1/np.sqrt(2)}\")\n\n```\n> Expectation value of Pz is 0.0 * hbar\n> Expectation value of Pz^2 is 0.5 * hbar^2\n> Uncertainty Delta Pz is 0.7071067811865476 * hbar\n> As a fraction, this is hbar/sqrt(2), which is approximately 0.7071067811865476\n\nThe python code confirms the manual calculation.

Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n\nThe expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$.\nFirst, let's find the result of $P_z |\\psi\\rangle$:\n$$ P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} (1 \\cdot -1/2) + (0) + (0) \\\\ (0) + (0) + (0) \\\\ (0) + (0) + (-1 \\cdot -1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, we compute the inner product $\\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n$$ \\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) $$\n$$ \\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( (-\\frac{1}{2})(-\\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})(0) + (-\\frac{1}{2})(\\frac{1}{2}) \\right) = \\hbar \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = 0 $$\nSo, $\\langle P_z \\rangle = 0$.\n\n**3.
