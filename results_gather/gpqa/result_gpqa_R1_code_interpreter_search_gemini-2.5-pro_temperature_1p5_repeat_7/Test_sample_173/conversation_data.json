    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:**\n    *   Initial nucleus: rest-mass M, rest-mass energy M*c² = 300 GeV. It is at rest, so initial momentum is 0.\n    *   Fission: The nucleus splits into two fragments, m1 and m2.\n    *   Mass relationship: \"one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other\". This is commonly interpreted as m1 = 2 * m2. We will proceed with this interpretation. Let m1 be the more massive fragment.\n    *   Mass-energy loss: The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass. (m1 + m2) = 0.99 * M. This means 1% of the initial rest-mass energy is converted into kinetic energy for the fragments.\n    *   Objective: Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) calculated using relativistic mechanics and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) mechanics.\n\n2.  **Calculate Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: M*c² = 300 GeV.\n    *   Sum of final rest-mass energies: (m1 + m2) * c² = 0.99 * M*c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n    *   Let E_m1 = m1*c² and E_m2 = m2*c².\n    *   We have a system of two equations:\n        1.  E_m1 + E_m2 = 297 GeV\n        2.  E_m1 = 2 * E_m2 (from m1 = 2*m2)\n    *   Substitute (2) into (1): 2*E_m2 + E_m2 = 297 GeV => 3*E_m2 = 297 GeV.\n    *   Solving for E_m2: E_m2 = 99 GeV.\n    *   Solving for E_m1: E_m1 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\n    *   The total kinetic energy (Q) released is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energies.\n    *   Q = T1 + T2 = M*c² - (m1*c² + m2*c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\n4.  **Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:**\n    *   By conservation of momentum, the initial momentum (0) equals the final total momentum. This means the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum (|p1| = |p2| = p).\n    *   Classical kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\n    *   T1_classical = p² / (2*m1)\n    *   T2_classical = p² / (2*m2)\n    *   The ratio of the kinetic energies is: T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2.\n    *   So, T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical.\n    *   We know the total kinetic energy: T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV.\n    *   Substitute T2: T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV => 3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV.\n    *   Therefore, T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV.\n\n5.  **Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics:**\n    *   We again use the conservation of energy and momentum.\n    *   Total initial energy = Total final energy: M*c² = E1 + E2, where E is the total energy (rest mass + kinetic).\n    *   300 GeV = E1 + E2.\n    *   Momentum conservation: |p1| = |p2| = p.\n    *   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)².\n    *   From this, we can write: (p*c)² = E₁² - (m₁*c²)² and (p*c)² = E₂² - (m₂*c²)².\n    *   Setting them equal: E₁² - (m₁*c²)² = E₂² - (m₂*c²)².\n    *   Rearranging: E₁² - E₂² = (m₁*c²)² - (m₂*c²)².\n    *   Factoring the differences of squares: (E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (m₁*c² - m₂*c²)(m₁*c² + m₂*c²).\n    *   We know the values for each term:\n        *   E₁ + E₂ = M*c² = 300 GeV\n        *   m₁*c² + m₂*c² = 297 GeV\n        *   m₁*c² - m₂*c² = 198 GeV - 99 GeV = 99 GeV\n    *   Substitute these values into the equation: (E₁ - E₂)(300) = (99)(297).\n    *   E₁ - E₂ = (99 * 297) / 300 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV.\n    *   Now we have another system of two linear equations for the total energies E1 and E2:\n        1.  E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV\n        2.  E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV\n    *   Add the two equations to solve for E₁: 2*E₁ = 398.01 GeV => E₁ = 199.005 GeV.\n    *   The relativistic kinetic energy T1 is the total energy minus the rest energy:\n    *   T1_relativistic = E₁ - m₁*c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Difference:**\n    *   Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n    *   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nTo ensure the accuracy of the arithmetic, the following Python code can be used to verify the calculations:\n```python\n# All energies in MeV\nE_M = 300 * 1000  # Initial rest-mass energy\nM_SUM_FRAC = 0.99   # Sum of fragment masses as a fraction of initial mass\nM1_M2_RATIO = 2.0   # m1 = 2 * m2\n\n# Calculate fragment rest-mass energies\n# E_m1 + E_m2 = M_SUM_FRAC * E_M\n# E_m1 = M1_M2_RATIO * E_m2\n# (M1_M2_RATIO + 1) * E_m2 = M_SUM_FRAC * E_M\nE_m2 = (M_SUM_FRAC * E_M) / (M1_M2_RATIO + 1)\nE_m1 = M1_M2_RATIO * E_m2\n\n# Calculate total kinetic energy (Q-value)\nQ = E_M - (E_m1 + E_m2)\n\n# Calculate T1 (classical)\n# T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/M1_M2_RATIO => T2 = M1_M2_RATIO * T1\n# T1 + T2 = Q => T1 + M1_M2_RATIO * T1 = Q => T1 * (1 + M1_M2_RATIO) = Q\nT1_classical = Q / (1 + M1_M2_RATIO)\n\n# Calculate T1 (relativistic)\n# (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (E_m1 - E_m2)(E_m1 + E_m2)\n# E1 + E2 = E_M\n# E1 - E2 = (E_m1 - E_m2) * (E_m1 + E_m2) / E_M\nE1_minus_E2 = (E_m1 - E_m2) * (E_m1 + E_m2) / E_M\nE1_plus_E2 = E_M\n# 2*E1 = E1_plus_E2 + E1_minus_E2\nE1 = (E1_plus_E2 + E1_minus_E2) / 2\nT1_relativistic = E1 - E_m1\n\n# Calculate the difference\ndifference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n\nprint(f\"{difference=:.1f} MeV\")\n```\nThe output of this code confirms that the difference is 5.0 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Given Information:**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus: E₀ = M*c² = 300 GeV\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so initial momentum is zero.\n*   It splits into two fragments, m₁ and m₂.\n*   Mass ratio: m₁ = 2m₂ (let m₁ be the more massive fragment).\n*   Sum of fragment rest-masses: (m₁ + m₂) = 0.99 * M.\n\n**2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\nThe sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments is:\n(m₁*c² + m₂*c²) = 0.99 * (M*c²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  m₁*c² + m₂*c² = 297 GeV\n2.  m₁*c² = 2 * m₂*c² (from the mass ratio)\n\nSubstitute (2) into (1):\n2 * m₂*c² + m₂*c² = 297 GeV\n3 * m₂*c² = 297 GeV\nm₂*c² = 99 GeV (Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment)\n\nNow find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m₁):\nm₁*c² = 2 * m₂*c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value):**\nThe energy released as kinetic energy is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\nQ = T₁ + T₂ = E₀ - (m₁*c² + m₂*c²)\nQ = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T₁:**\nBy conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be 'p'.\np₁ = p₂ = p\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy T = p² / (2m).\n*   T₁_classical = p² / (2m₁)\n*   T₂_classical = p² / (2m₂)\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is:\nT₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / (2m₁)) / (p² / (2m₂)) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2.\nSo, T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\nT₁_classical + T₂_classical = Q\nT₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\nT₁_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV.\n\n**5. Relativistic Calculation of T₁:**\nAgain, we use conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂) and conservation of total energy. The total energy (rest mass + kinetic) is conserved.\n*   Initial Total Energy = M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   Final Total Energy = E₁ + E₂ = (T₁ + m₁*c²) + (T₂ + m₂*c²).\nSo, E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV.\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)².\nSince the momenta are equal: p₁² = p₂² => p₁²c² = p₂²c².\nE₁² - (m₁*c²)² = E₂² - (m₂*c²)²\nE₁² - E₂² = (m₁*c²)² - (m₂*c²)²\n(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (m₁*c² - m₂*c²)(m₁*c² + m₂*c²)\n\nNow, we substitute the known values:\n*   E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV\n*   m₁*c² - m₂*c² = 198 GeV - 99 GeV = 99 GeV\n*   m₁*c² + m₂*c² = 297 GeV\n\n(E₁ - E₂)(300) = (99)(297)\nE₁ - E₂ = (99 * 297) / 300 = 98.01 GeV.\n\nWe now have a new system of two linear equations:\n1.  E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV\n2.  E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV\n\nAdding the two equations:\n2*E₁ = 398.01 GeV\nE₁ = 199.005 GeV (This is the total energy of the more massive fragment).\n\nThe (correct) relativistic kinetic energy T₁ is:\nT₁ = E₁ - m₁*c²\nT₁ = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV.\n\n**6. Find the Difference:**\nDifference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)\nDifference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
