    "An electron is in a quantum spin state, which can be represented by a two-component vector called a spinor. The given spin state is `|ψ⟩`, represented by the vector `(3i, 4)`. We want to find the expectation value of the spin angular momentum in the y-direction, denoted as `<S_y>`.\n\n### 1. The State Vector\n\nThe unnormalized spin state is given by the column vector (ket):\n`|ψ⟩ =`\n`[ 3i ]`\n`[ 4  ]`\n\n### 2. Normalization\n\nFor any calculation of physical observables like expectation values, the state vector must be normalized. A state `|ψ⟩` is normalized if `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 1`, where `⟨ψ|` is the conjugate transpose (bra) of `|ψ⟩`.\n\nFirst, we find the bra vector `⟨ψ|`:\n`⟨ψ| = [ (3i)*  4* ] = [ -3i  4 ]`\n\nNext, we calculate the inner product `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`, which is the squared norm of the vector:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [ -3i  4 ] * [ 3i ]`\n                  `[ 4  ]`\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16 = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n\nThe normalization constant is `1/sqrt(⟨ψ|ψ⟩) = 1/sqrt(25) = 1/5`.\nSo, the normalized state `|ψ_norm⟩` is:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/5) * [ 3i ]`\n                   `[ 4  ]`\n\nThe corresponding normalized bra is:\n`⟨ψ_norm| = (1/5) * [ -3i  4 ]`\n\n### 3. The Spin Operator S_y\n\nThe spin operator for a spin-1/2 particle (like an electron) is given by `S = (ħ/2)σ`, where `σ` represents the Pauli matrices. For the y-direction, the operator is:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`\n\nThe problem provides the Pauli-y matrix `σ_y`:\n`σ_y = `\n`[ 0  -i ]`\n`[ i   0 ]`\n\nTherefore, the `S_y` operator is:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) *`\n`[ 0  -i ]`\n`[ i   0 ]`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value\n\nThe expectation value of an operator `A` for a state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula `⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩`. Using our normalized state, the expectation value of `S_y` is:\n`⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ_norm| S_y |ψ_norm⟩`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `⟨ψ_norm|`, `S_y`, and `|ψ_norm⟩`:\n`⟨S_y⟩ = (1/5) * [ -3i  4 ] * ( (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ] ) * (1/5) * [ 3i ]`\n                                       `[ i   0 ]`          `[ 4  ]`\n\nWe can pull out the constants `(1/5) * (ħ/2) * (1/5) = ħ/50`:\n`⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * [ -3i  4 ] * [ 0  -i ] * [ 3i ]`\n                             `[ i   0 ]   [ 4  ]`\n\nLet's first compute the matrix-vector product:\n`[ 0  -i ] * [ 3i ] = [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) ] = [ -4i ]`\n`[ i   0 ]   [ 4  ]   [ (i)(3i) + (0)(4)  ]   [ 3i² ] = [ -3 ]`\n\nNow, substitute this result back into the equation for `⟨S_y⟩`:\n`⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * [ -3i  4 ] * [ -4i ]`\n                             `[ -3  ]`\n\nFinally, compute the inner product:\n`⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * ( (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) )`\n`⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * ( 12i² - 12 )`\nSince `i² = -1`:\n`⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * ( 12(-1) - 12 )`\n`⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * ( -12 - 12 )`\n`⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * ( -24 )`\n`⟨S_y⟩ = -24ħ / 50`\n\nSimplifying the fraction gives:\n`⟨S_y⟩ = -12ħ / 25`\n\nThis result matches option B. To confirm, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the unnormalized state vector psi\npsi = np.array([3j, 4])\n\n# Define the Pauli-y matrix\nsigma_y = np.array([[0, -1j], \n                    [1j, 0]])\n\n# The expectation value of S_y is given by:\n# <S_y> = <psi| S_y |psi> / <psi|psi>\n# S_y = (hbar/2) * sigma_y\n# So, <S_y> = (hbar/2) * <psi| sigma_y |psi> / <psi|psi>\n\n# First, calculate <psi| sigma_y |psi>\n# psi_bra is the conjugate transpose of psi\npsi_bra = psi.conj().T\n# Calculate sigma_y * psi\nsigma_y_psi = np.dot(sigma_y, psi)\n# Calculate the numerator part (without hbar/2)\nnumerator = np.dot(psi_bra, sigma_y_psi)\n\n# Next, calculate the normalization factor <psi|psi>\ndenominator = np.dot(psi_bra, psi)\n\n# The expectation value of sigma_y is numerator / denominator\nexp_val_sigma_y = numerator / denominator\n\n# The expectation value of S_y is (hbar/2) * exp_val_sigma_y.\n# The question asks for the answer as a fraction of hbar.\n# We need to find the value of <S_y>/hbar = (1/2) * exp_val_sigma_y.\n# Let's find the numerical coefficient of hbar, which is exp_val_sigma_y / 2\n# This corresponds to -24/25 / 2 = -12/25\n# So the result is -12*hbar/25\n\n# Let's print the numerator and denominator to see the fraction -24/25\nprint(f\"Numerator: {numerator.real}\")\nprint(f\"Denominator: {denominator.real}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nNumerator: -24.0\nDenominator: 25.0\n</execute_result>\n\nThe code output shows that `<psi| σ_y |psi> = -24` and `<psi|ψ> = 25`.\nThe expectation value of `σ_y` is `<σ_y> = -24/25`.\nTherefore, the expectation value of `S_y` is:\n`⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * ⟨σ_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = -12ħ/25`.\n\n<<<B>>>",
