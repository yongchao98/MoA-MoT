    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n*   **The Vector Field (f):** The field is described as `f(r)`.\n    *   It points radially outwards from the origin.\n    *   Its magnitude is `f(r) = 1/r^2`.\n    *   In vector form using spherical coordinates, this can be written as `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n*   **The Volume (V):** The integration is performed over the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**2. Choose a Method**\n\nThere are two primary methods to solve this:\n    a) Direct Calculation: First find the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` and then integrate it over the volume `V`.\n    b) Divergence Theorem: Convert the volume integral of the divergence into a surface integral over the boundary of the volume.\n\nThe direct calculation method can be tricky because the field `f(r) = 1/r^2` is singular (it goes to infinity) at the origin (`r=0`), which is inside our volume of integration. The Divergence Theorem is often the best tool for handling such singularities.\n\n**3. Applying the Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ n_hat) dS`\n\nLet's break down the right-hand side (the surface integral):\n\n*   **S (The Surface):** The surface `S` that encloses the volume `V` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n*   **n_hat (The Normal Vector):** For a sphere centered at the origin, the outward-pointing unit normal vector at any point on the surface is simply the radial unit vector, `r_hat`. So, `n_hat = r_hat`.\n\n*   **f on the surface S:** We need to evaluate the vector field `f` on the surface of the sphere, where the radial distance `r` is equal to `R`.\n    `f(at r=R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n\n*   **The Dot Product (f ⋅ n_hat):** Now we compute the dot product of the field on the surface and the normal vector.\n    `f ⋅ n_hat = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [r_hat]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = |r_hat|^2 = 1`, the dot product is:\n    `f ⋅ n_hat = 1/R^2`\n    Notice that this value is a constant everywhere on the surface of the sphere.\n\n*   **The Surface Integral:** Now we can perform the integration.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ n_hat) dS = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n    Since `1/R^2` is a constant with respect to the surface integration, we can pull it out of the integral:\n    `= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n    The integral `∮_S dS` simply means \"sum up all the small surface elements `dS` over the entire surface `S`\", which gives the total surface area of the sphere.\n    The surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n    So, the integral becomes:\n    `= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n\n*   **Final Result:** The `R^2` terms cancel out.\n    `= 4π`\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of the field is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere, as long as the sphere encloses the origin (the source of the field). The calculation correctly handles the singularity at `r=0`. If we had incorrectly calculated the divergence as 0 everywhere (which is true for `r ≠ 0`), we would have gotten an incorrect answer of 0 for the integral.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 4 π\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nOur calculated answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
