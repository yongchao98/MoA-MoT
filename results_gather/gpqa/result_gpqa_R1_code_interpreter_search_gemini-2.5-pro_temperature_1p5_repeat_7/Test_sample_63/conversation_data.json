    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data**\n\nThe problem describes the heating of an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gases are passed through a series of tubes, and we are given the change in mass for each tube.\n\n*   **Initial State:** An equimolar mixture of salt A and salt B weighing 7.20 g. Let 'n' be the number of moles of salt A, and 'n' be the number of moles of salt B.\n*   **Decomposition:** The mixture is heated to 200°C, producing a mixture of gases.\n    `n A + n B -> Gas Mixture`\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** This is limewater, used to test for acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no CO₂ (or other acidic gases) were produced in the decomposition.\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    `2Cu + O₂ -> 2CuO`\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain (at Standard Temperature and Pressure - STP). This gas did not react with the substances in the tubes, suggesting it is relatively inert. Nitrogen (N₂) is a common inert gas produced from the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Each Gaseous Product**\n\nWe will use the molar masses and the molar volume of a gas at STP (22.4 L/mol) to find the moles of each product.\n\n*   **Moles of Water (H₂O):**\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol H₂O\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O₂):**\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol O₂\n\n*   **Moles of Gas C (assumed to be N₂):**\n    *   Molar volume at STP = 22.4 L/mol\n    *   Moles = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol N₂\n\nSo, the decomposition reaction produced 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (H₂O, N₂, O₂) contain hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. Therefore, the original salts A and B must also contain these elements. Given that they are salts, they likely consist of an ammonium cation (NH₄⁺) and nitrogen-oxygen anions like nitrite (NO₂⁻) or nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n\nLet's hypothesize the identities of the salts and see if their decomposition matches the product ratios.\n*   **Hypothesis:** Salt A is Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Salt B is Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's consider their decomposition reactions:\n*   Ammonium nitrite decomposes to nitrogen and water:\n    `NH₄NO₂(s) -> N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n*   Ammonium nitrate can decompose in several ways. At temperatures around 200-250°C, it can decompose into nitrogen, oxygen, and water:\n    `2NH₄NO₃(s) -> 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)`\n    We can write this for one mole of reactant as:\n    `NH₄NO₃(s) -> N₂(g) + 0.5O₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n\nNow, let's assume we started with 'n' moles of each salt, based on the equimolar mixture condition.\n*   `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ produces: `n` mol N₂ and `2n` mol H₂O.\n*   `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ produces: `n` mol N₂, `0.5n` mol O₂, and `2n` mol H₂O.\n\n**Total moles of products:**\n*   Total N₂ = `n + n = 2n`\n*   Total O₂ = `0.5n`\n*   Total H₂O = `2n + 2n = 4n`\n\n**4. Verify the Hypothesis with Experimental Data**\n\nWe can now use the experimentally determined moles of products to solve for 'n' and check for consistency.\n\n*   From O₂: `0.5n = 0.025 mol`  => `n = 0.05 mol`\n\nNow, let's use this value of n=0.05 to check the amounts of the other products:\n*   Predicted N₂ = `2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol` (This matches the experimental 0.10 mol)\n*   Predicted H₂O = `4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol` (This matches the experimental 0.20 mol)\n\nThe product amounts are perfectly consistent with our hypothesis. Now let's verify the initial mass.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol\n*   Total Mass = (moles of A × Molar Mass of A) + (moles of B × Molar Mass of B)\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g\n\nThis matches the initial mass given in the problem. The hypothesis is confirmed.\n*   **Salt A = NH₄NO₂**\n*   **Salt B = NH₄NO₃**\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms\n\n**Total Atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**\n\n```python\n# Moles of products\nmoles_H2O = 3.60 / 18.0\nmoles_O2 = 0.80 / 32.0\nmoles_N2 = 2.24 / 22.4\n\n# From the stoichiometry of the proposed reactions (Total O2 = 0.5*n), we find n.\nn = moles_O2 / 0.5\n\n# Molar masses\nM_NH4NO2 = 64.0\nM_NH4NO3 = 80.0\n\n# Verify total mass\ntotal_mass = n * M_NH4NO2 + n * M_NH4NO3\n\n# Count atoms\n# NH4NO2 -> N:2, H:4, O:2 -> 8 atoms\n# NH4NO3 -> N:2, H:4, O:3 -> 9 atoms\ntotal_atoms = (2 + 4 + 2) + (2 + 4 + 3)\n\nprint(f\"Calculated moles of initial salts (n): {n:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Calculated total mass: {total_mass:.2f} g\")\nprint(f\"Total number of atoms in the two salts: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated, producing a mixture of gases. This gas mixture was passed through several tubes, allowing us to identify the components and their quantities.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Gaseous Products:**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a dehydrating agent. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n        *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no significant amount of acidic gases were produced.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Molar Mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After the absorption of water and oxygen, 2.24 L of a gas remains at STP. This corresponds to:\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   The products are H₂O, O₂, and an inert gas (C). This points to the original salts being composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). Therefore, Gas C is most likely Nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Identifying the Salts A and B:**\n    *   The decomposition products are N₂, O₂, and H₂O. The original salts must contain N, H, and O. Common salts with these elements are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). Let's test this hypothesis.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃.\n    *   The decomposition reactions at around 200°C are:\n        *   A: `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n        *   B: `2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)` or for one mole: `NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂(g) + 0.5O₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n    *   The problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles for both salt A and salt B.\n    *   From the decomposition of `n` moles of each salt, the total moles of products are:\n        *   Total Moles of O₂ = `n * 0.5` (only from salt B)\n        *   Total Moles of N₂ = `n * 1` (from A) + `n * 1` (from B) = `2n`\n        *   Total Moles of H₂O = `n * 2` (from A) + `n * 2` (from B) = `4n`\n\n3.  **Verifying the Hypothesis:**\n    *   We can find 'n' using the moles of oxygen calculated earlier:\n        *   0.025 mol O₂ = 0.5n  =>  n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of salt A and 0.05 mol of salt B.\n    *   Let's check if this value of 'n' gives the correct amounts of the other products:\n        *   Predicted Moles of N₂ = 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches experiment).\n        *   Predicted Moles of H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol (Matches experiment).\n    *   Finally, let's check the initial total mass:\n        *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.0 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol * 64.0 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n        *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.0 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol * 80.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   Total Mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g (Matches the given initial mass).\n    *   The hypothesis is correct: Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n    *   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total Atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>"
