    "The user wants to compare the magnitude of two energy values:\n1.  The paramagnetic coupling energy, which arises from the interaction of an electron's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field (Zeeman effect).\n2.  The transition energy of a Hydrogen atom corresponding to a given wavelength.\n\n**1. Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\langle H \\rangle$)**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the paramagnetic coupling of an electron's orbital angular momentum with an external magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is given by:\n$H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\nwhere $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic moment.\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_e$ is the mass of the electron.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian gives:\n$H = \\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field is parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{k}$. The dot product becomes:\n$\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$\n\nThe energy of this interaction is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. The operator $L_z$ has eigenvalues $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Therefore, the energy shift is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} m B$\n\nThe term $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is a fundamental constant known as the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$.\n$\\mu_B \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}$\n\nSo, the paramagnetic coupling energy is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B$\n\nWe are given:\n*   $B = 1$ T\n*   $m$ is a small integer (e.g., $m=1, 2, ...$)\n\nLet's calculate the energy for a representative small value, $m=1$:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}) \\times (1 \\text{ T}) = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n\n**2. Calculate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the formula:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nA convenient form of this equation is:\n$\\Delta E (\\text{in eV}) = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{\\lambda (\\text{in nm})}$\n\nWe are given the wavelength $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$. First, convert this to nanometers:\n$\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ nm}}{1 \\, \\mu\\text{m}} = 486.1 \\text{ nm}$\n\nNow, calculate the transition energy:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{486.1 \\text{ nm}} \\approx 2.551 \\text{ eV}$\n\n(Note: This wavelength, 486.1 nm, corresponds to the Balmer beta transition in the Hydrogen atom, from the $n=4$ to the $n=2$ energy level).\n\n**3. Compare the Magnitudes**\n\nNow we compare the two energy values:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n*   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n\nLet's find the ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}}{2.551 \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThis ratio is extremely small, which means the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the electronic transition energy.\n\nTherefore, $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
