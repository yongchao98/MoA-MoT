    "The wavelength of the emitted light is 530.01 nm.\n\n4.  **Step 2: Determine the color of the emitted light.**\n    *   The calculated wavelength of the emitted light is approximately 530 nm.\n    *   Referring to the visible light spectrum:\n        *   Violet: ~400–450 nm\n        *   Blue: ~450–495 nm\n        *   Green: ~495–570 nm\n        *   Yellow: ~570–590 nm\n        *   Orange: ~590–620 nm\n        *   Red: ~620–750 nm\n    *   A wavelength of 530 nm falls squarely in the **green** region of the spectrum. So, the dye emits green light.\n\n5.  **Step 3: Find the absorbed color.**\n    *   The color a substance appears (or emits) is complementary to the color of light it absorbs.\n    *   We need to find the complementary color of green.\n    *   Looking at a color wheel:\n        *   The complementary color of green is **red**.\n        *   The complementary color of blue is orange.\n        *   The complementary color of yellow is violet.\n    *   Since the dye emits green light, it must be absorbing light in the red region of the spectrum.\n\n6.  **Review the options:**\n    *   A) Blue\n    *   B) Violet\n    *   C) Red\n    *   D) Yellow\n    *   The calculated absorbed color is red, which corresponds to option C.\n\n7.  **Final conclusion:** The compound emits green light (λ ≈ 530 nm), which means it absorbs the complementary color, red.\n\n<<<C>>>"
