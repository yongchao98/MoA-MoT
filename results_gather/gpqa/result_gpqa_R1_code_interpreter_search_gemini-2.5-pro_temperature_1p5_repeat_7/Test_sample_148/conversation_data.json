    "*   **Analysis of the problem:**\n    *   We have a synthesized small peptidic compound. Peptides are characterized by amide bonds.\n    *   **NMR data:** Two peaks are observed for a single alpha-proton. They have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals that sum to 1H. This indicates the presence of two distinct chemical species, each containing that alpha-proton, and they are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio. The possibility of spin-spin coupling causing the splitting is ruled out.\n    *   **LC-MS data:** Two peaks are observed in the liquid chromatogram. This confirms the presence of two different species that can be separated based on their physical properties (polarity, etc.). The mass spectrum for both peaks is identical and matches the expected molecular weight of the target compound. This is a critical piece of information.\n    *   **LC-MS temperature:** The analysis was run at an \"elevated temperature.\" This might be a clue related to the interconversion of species.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the options:**\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would imply a side product with a different molecular structure, likely a different molecular weight (e.g., adding an extra amino acid). The LC-MS data contradicts this, as both observed peaks have the mass of the expected molecule. So, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and on a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce a single peak in both the NMR and the LC trace. To separate them, chiral conditions (chiral NMR solvent, chiral shift reagent, or a chiral LC column) are required, none of which are mentioned. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   They will give distinct signals in an NMR spectrum.\n        *   They can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography.\n        *   By definition, they have the same molecular formula and thus the same molecular weight.\n        This fits all the experimental observations perfectly. A common source of diastereomerism in peptides is *cis-trans* isomerism about the amide (peptide) bond. The partial double-bond character of the C-N bond restricts rotation, and the energy barrier can be high enough that both the *cis* and *trans* conformers are observed as separate species on the NMR and LC timescales, especially at or near room temperature. The alpha-proton is in a different chemical environment in the *cis* isomer compared to the *trans* isomer, leading to two distinct NMR peaks. The fact that the LC-MS at elevated temperature still resolves two peaks suggests that the energy barrier to interconversion is still significant on the timescale of the chromatography experiment. This is the most plausible explanation.\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis would have a different chemical structure and, most likely, a different molecular weight. The mass spectrometry data shows that both peaks have the same mass as the final product, which rules out contamination with a precursor. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The observation of two separable species by LC, both having the same mass as the target molecule, and showing two distinct sets of signals in the NMR spectrum is the classic signature of a mixture of diastereomers. In the context of a peptide, this is most commonly caused by *cis-trans* rotational isomers (rotamers) around an amide bond.\n\n<<<C>>>"
