    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with one stereocenter at the C5 position, and its configuration is given as (S). The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃. The ketone group is at C3.\n*   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The carbon of the ketone (C3) is prochiral. Its reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the starting material already has a stereocenter at C5, the hydride attack can occur from two different faces of the carbonyl group, leading to the formation of two products. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the configuration at one stereocenter (C3) while having the same configuration at another (C5). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. We need to consider all possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they form an **enantiomeric pair**. Since the reaction starts with an achiral reactant and uses achiral reagents, this pair will be formed as a racemic mixture (1:1 ratio).\n    *   (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) are the same molecule. This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through the C3-CH₂ group) and is therefore an achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: one meso compound and one racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture**\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n**Step 4: Predict the number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and therefore cannot be separated on a normal-phase (achiral) column. They will elute together, giving a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are separable on a normal-phase column.\n*   **Constitutional isomers** have different structures and are also separable.\n*   Let's analyze our mixture:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I ((1) and (2)) are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair ((3) and (4)) and a meso compound ((5)). The enantiomers will co-elute, giving **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will have a different retention time and give a separate peak, which is **1 peak**. In total, the products from Reaction II give **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂, alcohol-ethers) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂, diols). They have significantly different structures and polarities. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that any product from Reaction I would co-elute with a product from Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the number of peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   Essentially, a chiral HPLC column can separate all non-identical stereoisomers.\n*   Our mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers (listed in Step 3).\n*   A chiral column will resolve all of them:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 1\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 2 (different from Peak 1)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 3\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 4 (separated from its enantiomer, Peak 3)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 5 (different from all others)\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
