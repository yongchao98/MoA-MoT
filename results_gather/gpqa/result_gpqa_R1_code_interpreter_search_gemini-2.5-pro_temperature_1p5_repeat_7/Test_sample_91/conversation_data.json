    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. The general formula for calculating the enthalpy of formation from atomization and bond energies is:\n\nΔH_f = (Sum of enthalpies of atomization of constituent elements in their standard state) - (Sum of bond energies of the compound)\n\nLet's break down the calculation into several steps.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.**\n\nThe molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Count Carbon (C) atoms:**\n    *   (CH3)2C: 3 carbons\n    *   =CH-: 1 carbon\n    *   -CH2-: 1 carbon\n    *   -CH(CH3)-: 2 carbons\n    *   -CH2-: 1 carbon\n    *   -CH=: 1 carbon\n    *   =C(CH3)2: 3 carbons\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12.\n\n*   **Count Hydrogen (H) atoms:**\n    *   (CH3)2: 2 * 3 = 6 hydrogens\n    *   =CH-: 1 hydrogen\n    *   -CH2-: 2 hydrogens\n    *   -CH(CH3)-: 1 + 3 = 4 hydrogens\n    *   -CH2-: 2 hydrogens\n    *   -CH=: 1 hydrogen\n    *   =C(CH3)2: 2 * 3 = 6 hydrogens\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Count the bonds:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** We can see two double bonds in the structure: (CH3)2**C=C**H- and -CH**=C**(CH3)2. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** We can count the single bonds connecting the carbon atoms.\n        *   2 bonds in (CH3)2C=\n        *   1 bond in =CH-CH2-\n        *   1 bond in -CH2-CH(CH3)-\n        *   1 bond in -CH(CH3)-\n        *   1 bond in -CH(CH3)-CH2-\n        *   1 bond in -CH2-CH=\n        *   2 bonds in =C(CH3)2\n        *   Total C-C single bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the sum of bond energies for the compound.**\n\nThis is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, which is the energy required to break it down into gaseous atoms.\nSum of bond energies = (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H)) + (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C))\nUsing the given values:\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n\nSum of bond energies = (22 × 400) + (9 × 200) + (2 × 300)\nSum of bond energies = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the sum of enthalpies of atomization of the constituent elements.**\n\nThe formation of one mole of C12H22 requires 12 moles of Carbon in its standard state (C, solid/graphite) and 11 moles of Hydrogen in its standard state (H2, gas).\nSum of enthalpies of atomization = (12 × ΔH_atomization(C)) + (11 × ΔH_atomization(H2))\nWe are given:\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of Carbon (C(s) → C(g)), ΔH_atomization(C) = 1000 kJ/mol.\n*   Bond energy of H-H (H2(g) → 2H(g)), BE(H-H) = 100 kJ/mol. The enthalpy of atomization for one mole of H2 molecules is 100 kJ.\n\nSum of enthalpies of atomization = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\nSum of enthalpies of atomization = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ/mol**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) in kJ/mol.**\n\nΔH_f = (Sum of enthalpies of atomization of elements) - (Sum of bond energies of the compound)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Convert the enthalpy of formation to the required units (kJ/g).**\n\nSome of the options are given in kJ/g, so we need to convert our result. First, we calculate the molar mass of C12H22.\n*   Molar mass of C ≈ 12 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of H ≈ 1 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g.\n\nThis value is very close to option B.\n\nI will use a python script to verify the arithmetic.\n```python\n# Given values\nenthalpy_atomization_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_HH = 100  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CC_single = 200  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CC_double = 300  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CH = 400  # kJ/mol\n\n# Molecular composition and bond counts\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\nnum_CC_single_bonds = 9\nnum_CC_double_bonds = 2\n\n# Calculate the sum of bond energies of the compound (enthalpy of atomization of compound)\nsum_of_bond_energies = (num_CH_bonds * bond_energy_CH) + \\\n                       (num_CC_single_bonds * bond_energy_CC_single) + \\\n                       (num_CC_double_bonds * bond_energy_CC_double)\n\n# Calculate the sum of enthalpies of atomization of the elements\n# We need 12 moles of C atoms and 11 moles of H2 molecules\nsum_of_element_atomization = (num_C * enthalpy_atomization_C) + ((num_H / 2) * bond_energy_HH)\n\n# Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\ndelta_H_f_mol = sum_of_element_atomization - sum_of_bond_energies\n\n# Calculate molar mass of C12H22\nmolar_mass_compound = (num_C * 12.0) + (num_H * 1.0)\n\n# Convert enthalpy of formation to kJ/g\ndelta_H_f_gram = delta_H_f_mol / molar_mass_compound\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): {delta_H_f_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Molar Mass (g/mol): {molar_mass_compound}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): {delta_H_f_gram:.2f}\")\n```\n> Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0\n> Molar Mass (g/mol): 166.0\n> Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): 11.45\n\nThe calculated value is 11.45 kJ/g, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
