    "This question asks us to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's analyze the physical meaning of this approximation and evaluate each statement.\n\nThe impulse approximation is a simplifying assumption used in scattering problems involving bound systems, like a projectile hitting a nucleon inside a nucleus. The core idea is that the interaction between the projectile and the single nucleon is very rapid, like an \"impulse\". Because it happens so quickly, we can make several simplifying assumptions about the process.\n\nLet's break down each of the four statements provided:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is a fundamental part of the impulse approximation. It assumes that the interaction operator for the whole nucleus can be written as a sum of one-body operators, one for each nucleon. This means the projectile interacts cleanly with one nucleon at a time. It explicitly neglects more complex interactions, such as those involving meson-exchange currents (where the probe interacts with the particles that bind the nucleons together) or simultaneous interactions with multiple nucleons. This assumption is essential for treating the process as a quasi-free scattering event.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This assumption deals with what happens to the particles *before* and *after* the main interaction. It implies that the incoming projectile does not interact with other nucleons on its way to the target nucleon, and that both the projectile and the struck nucleon can exit the nucleus without any further scattering (these are called final-state interactions). While sometimes treated as a separate part called the \"Plane Wave Impulse Approximation\" (PWIA), it is a crucial component for the overall approximation to be useful and to directly relate the observed outcome to the properties of a single, free nucleon. Without this assumption, the \"clean\" single-nucleon interaction signal would be distorted by subsequent interactions, making analysis much more complex.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, describing it in terms of its constituent quarks. The impulse approximation, however, operates at the level of the nucleus, treating *nucleons* as the fundamental constituents. It simplifies the interaction of a nucleon *within the nucleus*. The internal physics of the nucleon (e.g., whether its quarks are relativistic or not) is a separate issue, typically handled by nucleon form factors which describe the nucleon's charge and current distributions. One can use the impulse approximation regardless of the specific model chosen for the nucleon's internal structure. Therefore, this is not a defining assumption of the impulse approximation at the nuclear scale.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This is the heart of the \"impulse\" concept. The assumption is that the interaction time is so short compared to the characteristic time of the nucleon's motion within the nucleus (its orbital period) that the nucleon is effectively \"frozen\" during the collision. In this brief instant, the forces binding the nucleon to the rest of the nucleus can be ignored. The nucleon acts as a free particle, albeit one with an initial momentum given by its motion within the nucleus (Fermi motion).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe impulse approximation is built on three pillars:\n- The interaction involves only a single nucleon (Assumption 1).\n- During the brief interaction, this nucleon is treated as free from its binding potential (Assumption 4).\n- The projectile and ejected nucleon do not re-interact with the rest of the nucleus (Assumption 2).\n\nAssumptions 1, 2, and 4 jointly form the basis of the impulse approximation. Assumption 3 is related to a different level of physical description (the internal structure of the nucleon) and is not a core requirement of this approximation.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
