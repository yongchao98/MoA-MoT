    "The user wants to determine the kinematically allowed decays of a hypothetical boson X into fermion-antifermion pairs.\n\n**1. Understanding the Interaction:**\nThe provided Lagrangian density for the interaction between the boson X and a fermion field $\\psi_f$ is:\n$\\mathcal{L}\\left(y\\right)=-\\lambda{f}\\bar{\\psi}{f}\\left(y\\right)\\left(\\upsilon+X\\left(y\\right)\\right)\\psi_{f}\\left(y\\right)$\n\nThis can be expanded into two terms:\n$\\mathcal{L}\\left(y\\right)=-\\lambda_{f}\\upsilon\\bar{\\psi}_{f}\\psi_{f} - \\lambda_{f}X\\bar{\\psi}_{f}\\psi_{f}$\n\nThe first term, $-\\lambda_{f}\\upsilon\\bar{\\psi}_{f}\\psi_{f}$, has the form of a mass term for the fermion $f$. In the Standard Model, the mass term for a fermion is $-m_f\\bar{\\psi}_f\\psi_f$. By comparing these, we can identify the fermion's mass as $m_f = \\lambda_f\\upsilon$.\n\nThe second term, $-\\lambda_{f}X\\bar{\\psi}_{f}\\psi_{f}$, describes the interaction vertex between one boson X and a fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$). This term governs the decay of X into $f\\bar{f}$.\n\n**2. Kinematic Condition for Decay:**\nFor any decay process to be physically possible, it must be kinematically allowed. This means the mass of the initial decaying particle must be greater than the sum of the masses of the decay products.\n\nFor the decay $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$, the condition is:\n$m_X > m_f + m_{\\bar{f}}$\n\nSince a fermion and its corresponding antifermion have the same mass ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition simplifies to:\n$m_X > 2m_f$\n\n**3. Applying the Given Values:**\nWe are given the mass of the boson X:\n$m_X = 6$ GeV\n\nSo, the condition for a decay to be allowed is:\n$6 \\text{ GeV} > 2m_f$\n$m_f < 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis means the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the mass of the fermion $f$ is less than 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Checking Fermion Masses:**\nWe need to compare the masses of the fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) to this 3 GeV threshold. Let's list the masses:\n\n*   **Leptons:**\n    *   Electron ($e$): $m_e \\approx 0.000511$ GeV ($< 3$ GeV) -> Decay $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is allowed.\n    *   Muon ($\\mu$): $m_\\mu \\approx 0.1057$ GeV ($< 3$ GeV) -> Decay $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ is allowed.\n    *   Tau ($\\tau$): $m_\\tau \\approx 1.777$ GeV ($< 3$ GeV) -> Decay $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is allowed.\n\n*   **Quarks:**\n    *   Up ($u$): $m_u \\approx 0.0022$ GeV ($< 3$ GeV) -> Decay $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is allowed.\n    *   Down ($d$): $m_d \\approx 0.0047$ GeV ($< 3$ GeV) -> Decay $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ is allowed.\n    *   Strange ($s$): $m_s \\approx 0.095$ GeV ($< 3$ GeV) -> Decay $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is allowed.\n    *   Charm ($c$): $m_c \\approx 1.27$ GeV ($< 3$ GeV) -> Decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is allowed.\n    *   Bottom ($b$): $m_b \\approx 4.18$ GeV ($> 3$ GeV) -> Decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **not** allowed.\n    *   Top ($t$): $m_t \\approx 173$ GeV ($> 3$ GeV) -> Decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **not** allowed.\n\n*(Note: Neutrinos have extremely small masses and are also kinematically allowed, but they are not listed in the options.)*\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\nThe kinematically allowed decay channels are into pairs of electrons, muons, taus, and up, down, strange, and charm quarks.\n\nAllowed decays:\n$X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$, $s\\bar{s}$, $u\\bar{u}$, $d\\bar{d}$, $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$, $\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$, $e^{+}e^{-}$\n\nLet's examine the given options:\n*   A) Includes $b\\bar{b}$ (disallowed).\n*   B) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ - This list perfectly matches our calculated allowed decays.\n*   C) Includes $b\\bar{b}$ and $t\\bar{t}$ (both disallowed).\n*   D) Excludes $c\\bar{c}$ and $\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ (both are allowed).\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
