    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how different types of mutations affect the protein produced from a gene. The goal is to find the mutation most likely to *eliminate* the function of the gene, which means creating a non-functional protein.\n\n**1. Understanding the Basics**\n\n*   **Gene Expression:** The DNA sequence of a gene is first transcribed into mRNA and then translated into a protein.\n*   **Translation:** The ribosome reads the mRNA in three-base units called codons. Translation starts at the `ATG` (or `AUG` in mRNA) start codon and ends when it reaches a stop codon (`TGA`, `TAA`, or `TAG` in DNA).\n*   **Types of Mutations:**\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** Changes a codon, but the new codon specifies the same amino acid. No effect on the protein.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** Changes a codon to one that specifies a different amino acid. The effect can range from negligible to complete loss of protein function, depending on the importance of that amino acid.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a codon that specifies an amino acid into a stop codon. This causes translation to terminate prematurely, resulting in a truncated (shortened) and almost always non-functional protein.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the reading frame, altering all subsequent codons and amino acids, usually leading to a premature stop codon and a non-functional protein.\n\n**2. Strategy**\n\nThe most effective way to guarantee the elimination of a protein's function is to introduce a nonsense mutation (a premature stop codon) or a frameshift mutation early in the gene's coding sequence. This will prevent the full-length protein from being synthesized. We will now analyze each mutant by translating its DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence and comparing it to the intact version.\n\nFirst, let's establish the amino acid sequence of the intact gene by reading it in codons (triplets) from the start codon `ATG`.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n*   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr ...\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant in the same way.\n\n```python\ndef translate(seq):\n    \"\"\"Translates a DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence.\"\"\"\n    table = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M',\n        'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K',\n        'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R',\n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L',\n        'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q',\n        'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V',\n        'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E',\n        'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S',\n        'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y', 'TAA':'_', 'TAG':'_',\n        'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C', 'TGA':'_', 'TGG':'W',\n    }\n    protein =\"\"\n    for i in range(0, len(seq) - (len(seq) % 3), 3):\n        codon = seq[i:i+3]\n        if codon in table:\n            protein += table[codon]\n        else:\n            protein += \"?\"\n        if table.get(codon) == '_':\n            break  # Stop translation at a stop codon\n    return protein\n\n# Gene sequences\nintact_gene = \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\nmutant_1 = \"ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\nmutant_2 = \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\nmutant_3 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\nmutant_4 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\" # As written in the prompt, this one is shorter\n\nprint(\"Intact protein:\", translate(intact_gene))\nprint(\"Mutant 1 protein:\", translate(mutant_1))\nprint(\"Mutant 2 protein:\", translate(mutant_2))\nprint(\"Mutant 3 protein:\", translate(mutant_3))\nprint(\"Mutant 4 protein:\", translate(mutant_4))\n\n# Let's align and see the codons more clearly\nprint(\"\\n---Codon Analysis---\")\nprint(\"Intact:  \", \"ATG TTT CTC GCT ...\")\n# In Mutant 1, TTTCTC becomes TTCTAC\nprint(\"Mutant 1:\", \"ATG TTC TAC GCT ...

Analysis of Results**\n\n*   **Intact Protein:** The normal protein starts with the amino acid sequence `Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr...`\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence becomes `Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala...`. This is a **missense mutation** where Leucine (Leu) is replaced by Tyrosine (Tyr). This might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence becomes `Met-Phe-STOP`. The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has mutated to `TAA` (a stop codon). This is a **nonsense mutation**. The ribosome will stop translation at this point, producing only a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). This protein is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n*   **Mutant 3:** This mutant has at least two **missense mutations**, changing Leucine to Tyrosine and Threonine to Valine. Similar to Mutant 1, this might disrupt function but doesn't guarantee it.\n*   **Mutant 4:** This mutant has a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion**, meaning one amino acid (Glycine) is removed without altering the reading frame. This might affect protein folding and function, but it's less disruptive than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMutant 2 is the only one that introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. This nonsense mutation is the most probable method among the given choices to completely eliminate the synthesis of the functional protein, thereby removing the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The goal is to find the mutation that is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thus eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. To do this, we need to analyze how each mutation affects the protein-coding sequence.\n\nThe most effective way to \"knock out\" a gene's function is to introduce a mutation that prevents the cell from making the full-length protein. A **nonsense mutation**, which changes an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon, is the most direct way to do this. It causes translation to terminate prematurely, resulting in a truncated and almost always non-functional protein.\n\nLet's analyze the codons (three-base pairs) at the beginning of each sequence:\n\n*   **Intact gene:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT CTC** GCT GGT ACT...-3’\n    *   Translation: Met - Phe - Leu...\n    This is the start of the normal protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTC TAC** GCT GGT ACT...-3’\n    *   Analysis: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). `TTC` still codes for Phenylalanine. This is a **missense mutation**—it swaps one amino acid for another. While this might alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTC TAA** GCT GGT ACT...-3’\n    *   Analysis: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. The ribosome will stop translating the mRNA at this point, producing only a two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). This peptide will not be functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT TAC** GCT GGT GTC...-3’\n    *   Analysis: This sequence has multiple changes. `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine) and further down, `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine). These are multiple **missense mutations**. As with Mutant 1, this results in a full-length protein with altered amino acids, which may or may not be functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT**...-3’\n    *   Analysis: Comparing this to the intact gene (`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `CTC` codon has changed to `TAC` (missense mutation), and the `GGT` codon has been completely deleted. This is an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 bases), which removes the amino acid Glycine from the protein. This is disruptive but less likely to completely abolish function than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMutant 2 is the only one that introduces a premature stop codon. This will truncate the protein synthesis very early, guaranteeing the production of a non-functional protein. Therefore, this mutation is the most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
