    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across the C1 and C6 positions. The molecule has specified stereochemistry at four chiral centers: C1, C3, C4, and C6.\n    *   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me2CuLi, which is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. The active nucleophile is the methyl anion (Me-), delivered as a soft nucleophile.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is the nucleophilic opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n2.  **Apply the Rules of the Reaction (as given in the problem statement):**\n\n    *   **Rule 1: Regioselectivity.** \"The alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n        *   The epoxide ring is formed by C1, C6, and the oxygen atom.\n        *   Carbon C1 is substituted with a methyl group, in addition to being part of the ring and bonded to oxygen. Thus, C1 is a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to C2, C6, O, and a methyl group).\n        *   Carbon C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom. Thus, C6 is a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to C1, C5, O, and a hydrogen atom).\n        *   Comparing the steric hindrance, the tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1).\n        *   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile (Me-) from the cuprate will attack **C6**.\n        *   This attack breaks the C6-O bond, and the oxygen atom remains attached to C1, forming a hydroxyl group (OH) after workup.\n        *   The product will be a cyclohexanol where the OH is at the original C1 position, and a new methyl group is at the original C6 position. This means the product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This finding immediately eliminates options A and D, which are 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol isomers that would result from attack at C1. We are left with options B and C.\n\n    *   **Rule 2: Stereoselectivity.** \"Inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"\n        *   This indicates an SN2 (bimolecular nucleophilic substitution) mechanism. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond (backside attack).\n        *   The attack occurs at C6. Therefore, the absolute configuration of the stereocenter at C6 will be inverted.\n        *   The other chiral centers (C1, C3, C4) are not part of the bond-breaking/bond-forming process. Their configurations will remain unchanged.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   We need to map the stereocenters from the reactant to the product.\n    *   **Product Numbering:** The OH group defines C1 of the cyclohexanol product. The ring is numbered to give the other substituents the lowest possible numbers. Since a methyl group is added at the adjacent carbon (the original C6), this becomes C2. The rest of the numbering follows around the ring.\n        *   Reactant C1 → Product C1 (location of OH)\n        *   Reactant C6 → Product C2 (location of new Me)\n        *   Reactant C5 → Product C3\n        *   Reactant C4 → Product C4\n        *   Reactant C3 → Product C5\n        *   Reactant C2 → Product C6\n    *   **Applying the stereochemistry rules:**\n        *   **At C1:** The configuration is unchanged. Reactant is (1R), so the product is **(1R)**.\n        *   **At C2 (from C6):** The configuration is inverted. Reactant is (6S), so the product is **(2R)**.\n        *   **At C4 (from C4):** The configuration is unchanged. Reactant is (4R), so the product is **(4R)**.\n        *   **At C5 (from C3):** The configuration is unchanged. Reactant is (3R), so the product is **(5R)**.\n    *   Combining these results, the product has the absolute configuration **(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n4.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   The derived product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n    *   Option A: (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect skeleton and stereochemistry)\n    *   Option B: (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Matches our result)\n    *   Option C: (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect stereochemistry at C2, implies retention of configuration)\n    *   Option D: (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect skeleton)\n\nTherefore, the correct product is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
