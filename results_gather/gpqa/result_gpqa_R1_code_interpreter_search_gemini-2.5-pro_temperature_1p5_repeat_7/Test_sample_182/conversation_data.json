    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant.**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down the name to draw the structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: This is the principal functional group (-COOH), so it is attached to carbon 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A formyl group (-CHO) is attached to carbon 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to carbon 5.\n\nBased on this, we can draw the structure and count the atoms to find the molecular formula:\n*   **Carbon (C):**\n    *   6 carbons in the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   1 carbon in the formyl group (-CHO).\n    *   2 carbons in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2).\n    *   Total carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   C1: 1 H\n    *   C2: 1 H\n    *   C3: 1 H\n    *   C4: 1 H\n    *   C5: 1 H\n    *   C6: 2 H\n    *   In -COOH: 1 H\n    *   In -CHO: 1 H\n    *   In -CH=CH2: 3 H\n    *   Total hydrogens = 1+1+1+1+1+2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12.\n*   **Oxygen (O):**\n    *   2 oxygens in the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   1 oxygen in the formyl group.\n    *   Total oxygens = 3.\n\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2. Analyze the reaction and the reagent.**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This combination is a very strong reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturated bonds (double and triple bonds) to the corresponding saturated alkanes.\n\nSpecifically, the following reductions will occur:\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The aldehyde (formyl) group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a single bond.\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group will be reduced to a single bond (i.e., the vinyl group -CH=CH2 becomes an ethyl group -CH2-CH3).\n\nThe fundamental carbon skeleton, including the ring structure, will remain intact. All oxygen atoms will be removed.\n\n**3. Determine the structure and molecular formula of the product.**\n\nThe reaction transforms the reactant into a saturated, substituted cycloalkane:\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The -COOH at C1 becomes -CH3.\n*   The -CHO at C2 becomes -CH3.\n*   The -CH=CH2 at C5 becomes -CH2CH3.\n\nThe product is an ethyl-dimethyl-cyclohexane. Let's find its molecular formula:\n*   **Carbon (C):** The number of carbon atoms does not change. So, C = 10.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** The final product is a substituted monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane). The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is **CnH2n**. Since our product has 10 carbon atoms, its formula will be C10H(2*10) = **C10H20**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** All oxygen atoms are removed. So, O = 0.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or pi (π) bonds in a molecule. The formula for IHD is:\n\nIHD = C - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2) + 1\n\nWhere:\n*   C = number of carbon atoms\n*   H = number of hydrogen atoms\n*   X = number of halogen atoms (0 in this case)\n*   N = number of nitrogen atoms (0 in this case)\n\nUsing the molecular formula of the product (C10H20):\nIHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the IHD by analyzing the structure of the product. The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It contains:\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of π bonds = 0 (all double bonds were saturated)\n\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nLet's double check using code.\n```python\n# The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane with 10 carbon atoms.\n# Its formula is C10H20.\nC = 10\nH = 20\n\n# IHD formula for a hydrocarbon: C - H/2 + 1\nihd = C - (H / 2) + 1\nprint(int(ihd))\n```\n> 실행 결과\n```\n1\n```\n\nThe calculation confirms that the IHD is 1.\n\nFinal Answer is 1. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Structure:** We start with a six-membered ring (`cyclohex`). It has a double bond between carbon 3 and 4 (`-3-ene`). The principal functional group is a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at position 1. At position 2, there is a formyl group (`-CHO`, an aldehyde). At position 5, there is a vinyl group (`-CH=CH2`).\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Let's count the atoms.\n    *   Carbon (C): 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = 10 carbons.\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 1 (at C1) + 1 (at C2) + 1 (at C3) + 1 (at C4) + 1 (at C5) + 2 (at C6) + 1 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) + 3 (in vinyl group) = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n    *   The molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent. It performs the following reductions:\n*   Reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to alkanes (in this case, a -CH3 group).\n*   Reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to alkanes (in this case, a -CH3 group).\n*   Reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n\nEssentially, it will remove all oxygen atoms and saturate all multiple bonds.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nApplying the reductions to our reactant:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the double bond is reduced).\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group at position 1 is reduced to a `methyl group` (-CH3).\n*   The `formyl group` at position 2 is reduced to a `methyl group` (-CH3).\n*   The `vinyl group` at position 5 is reduced to an `ethyl group` (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane, with all bonds being single bonds. The carbon skeleton is preserved, so the product still has 10 carbon atoms. Since the product is a fully saturated hydrocarbon containing a single ring (a cycloalkane), its general molecular formula is **CnH2n**.\n\n*   **Product Molecular Formula:** With C = 10, the formula is C10H(2*10) = **C10H20**. All oxygen atoms have been removed.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, tells us the number of rings and/or π-bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\n\nIHD = C - (H/2) + 1  (for hydrocarbons)\n\nUsing the product's formula, C10H20:\n*   C = 10\n*   H = 20\n\nIHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can find the IHD by inspecting the structure of the product. The product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of π-bonds = 0 (it is fully saturated)\n*   IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π-bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the IHD of the product is 1.\n\nTo verify the calculation, we can use a simple Python script.\n```python\n# The product is a monocyclic saturated hydrocarbon with 10 carbon atoms.\n# Its molecular formula is C10H20.\n# We calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).\n# The formula for a hydrocarbon CxHy is: IHD = x - y/2 + 1\n\nC = 10\nH = 20\n\nihd = C - (H / 2) + 1\nprint(int(ihd))\n```\n> 실행 결과\n```\n1\n```\nThe result confirms that the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>",
