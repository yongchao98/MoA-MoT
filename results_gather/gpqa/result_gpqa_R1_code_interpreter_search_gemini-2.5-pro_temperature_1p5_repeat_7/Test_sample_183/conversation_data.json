    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nLet's break down the structure and the relative positions of the substituents:\n*   **Parent:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe key structural features are the relative positions of the groups:\n*   The ethoxy (-OEt) and tert-butyl (-tBu) groups are **ortho** to each other.\n*   The tert-butyl (-tBu) and nitro (-NO2) groups are **ortho** to each other.\n*   The ethoxy (-OEt) and nitro (-NO2) groups are **meta** to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is crucial:\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho,para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho,para-director. Due to its large size (steric hindrance), it strongly favors para substitution.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Synthetic Challenge**\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is challenging to achieve through direct EAS because of conflicting directing effects.\n*   If we have an ethoxy group on the ring, it will direct incoming electrophiles (like -NO2 or -tBu) to the ortho and para positions, not the meta position. The target has a nitro group meta to the ethoxy group. This suggests the ethoxy group (or its precursor, -OH or -NH2) was not present as a simple o,p-director when the nitro group was added.\n*   The ortho relationship between the bulky -tBu group and the -OEt group is sterically hindered and difficult to form by direct substitution.\n\nThis complexity suggests that a multi-step synthesis involving blocking groups and/or functional group transformations is necessary.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's analyze each proposed reaction sequence. We should look for a sequence that logically overcomes the synthetic challenges. A common strategy for complex substitution patterns is the \"Nitrate -> Reduce -> Diazotize -> Substitute\" pathway and the use of sulfonic acid as a removable blocking group.\n\n*   **Option D:** Starts with nitration of benzene, followed by reduction to aniline, and then Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** The order of reagents listed appears to be flawed (e.g., `iv) NaNO2/HCl` appears before an amine is formed). This makes the sequence nonsensical as written. Thus, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** Let's trace this path.\n    i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.\n    ii) Nitration → 4-tert-butylnitrobenzene (para product is major due to sterics).\n    iii) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 4-tert-butylaniline.\n    iv) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4): The aniline is protonated to anilinium (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Both groups direct nitration to the position meta to the -NH3+ and ortho to the -tBu (position 3). This gives 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.\n    v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) of the amine.\n    vi) Hydrolysis (H3O+/Heat) to convert the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n    vii) Etherification (NaOH/EtBr) yields 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene.\n    This product is an isomer of the target molecule but not the correct one. The t-butyl and ethoxy groups are para to each other, not ortho. Thus, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence is the most complex and uses a blocking group strategy, which is often necessary for challenging substitution patterns. Let's trace it.\n    i) **Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.**\n    ii) **Sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** The bulky t-butyl group directs the sulfonation to the para position, which acts as a blocking group.\n    iii) **Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.** With the para position blocked, nitration is forced to occur at the ortho position relative to the t-butyl group.\n    iv) **Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n    v) **Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniobenzenesulfonate.** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. This intermediate is key. It has the t-butyl group ortho to the future hydroxyl/ethoxy group's precursor (the diazonium group).\n    vi) **Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** This is the most complex step. While nitrating such a deactivated ring is difficult, it's proposed to occur. Given the directing effects, substitution at C6 is plausible. `-tBu`(o,p), `-N2+`(m), `-SO3H`(m) can align to direct to C6. Let's assume this leads to nitration at the C6 position (which becomes C3 in the final product numbering).\n    vii) **Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat):** This step serves to replace the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    viii) **Desulfonation (dilute H2SO4/Heat):** This step removes the sulfonic acid (-SO3H) blocking group.\n    ix) **Etherification (NaOH/EtBr):** The phenol is converted to the final ethoxy ether.\n\nThe sequence in Option A correctly establishes the critical ortho relationship between the t-butyl group and the precursor to the ethoxy group by using a para-blocking group (-SO3H). While the exact mechanism of the second nitration is complex, this overall strategy is the only one provided that has the potential to create the required 1,2,3 substitution pattern. The other options lead to incorrect isomers or rely on chemically unsound reactions. Therefore, this sequence is the most plausible route to the desired product in high yield.\n\n<<<A>>>"
