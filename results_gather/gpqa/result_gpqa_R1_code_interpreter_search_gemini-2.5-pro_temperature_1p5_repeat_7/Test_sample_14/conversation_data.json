    "An observer wants to choose between two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, to observe for a transit. The choice will be based on which planet has a higher probability of transiting its host star.\n\n1.  **Define Transit Probability:** The geometric probability (p) of a planet transiting its star is approximately the ratio of the stellar radius (R_s) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a). For a circular orbit, this is:\n    p ≈ R_s / a\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Parameters using Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law connects the orbital period (P), the semi-major axis (a), and the mass of the host star (M_s). The formula is:\n    P² = (4π² / (G * M_s)) * a³\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis (a):\n    a³ = (G * M_s * P²) / (4π²)\n    a = ( (G * M_s * P²) / (4π²) )^(1/3)\n    This shows the proportionality:\n    a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)\n\n3.  **Combine the Formulas:** Substitute the expression for 'a' into the transit probability formula:\n    p ∝ R_s / (M_s * P²)^(1/3)\n\n4.  **Set up a Ratio:** To compare the probability of Planet_1 (p1) to that of Planet_2 (p2), we can create a ratio:\n    p1 / p2 = [ R_s1 / (M_s1 * P1²)^(1/3) ] / [ R_s2 / (M_s2 * P2²)^(1/3) ]\n    This simplifies to:\n    p1 / p2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * [ (M_s2 * P2²) / (M_s1 * P1²) ]^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Substitute the Given Information:**\n    *   The host stars have the same radii: R_s1 = R_s2, so (R_s1 / R_s2) = 1.\n    *   The mass of Star 1 is twice that of Star 2: M_s1 = 2 * M_s2, so (M_s2 / M_s1) = 1/2.\n    *   The period of Planet 2 is three times that of Planet 1: P2 = 3 * P1, so P2² = (3 * P1)² = 9 * P1², which means (P2² / P1²) = 9.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio:**\n    p1 / p2 = (1) * [ (1/2) * 9 ]^(1/3)\n    p1 / p2 = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\nWe will use a short Python script to compute the value of (4.5)^(1/3).\n\n```python\nimport math\n# Calculate the ratio of the probabilities, which is (4.5)^(1/3)\nratio = math.pow(4.5, 1/3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 1.65.\n\nTherefore, p1 / p2 ≈ 1.65, which means p1 ≈ 1.65 * p2. The probability of Planet_1 transiting is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. This makes Planet_1 the preferred target for observation.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The geometric probability (p) of a planet transiting its star is given by the ratio of the stellar radius (R_s) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a).\np ≈ R_s / a\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) and inversely proportional to the mass of the host star (M_s).\nP² ∝ a³/M_s\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis (a):\na³ ∝ P² * M_s\na ∝ (P² * M_s)^(1/3)\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for 'a' into our transit probability formula:\np ∝ R_s / (P² * M_s)^(1/3)\n\nTo compare the transit probabilities of Planet_1 (p1) and Planet_2 (p2), we can set up a ratio:\np1 / p2 = [R_s1 / (P1² * M_s1)^(1/3)] / [R_s2 / (P2² * M_s2)^(1/3)]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\np1 / p2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * [(P2² * M_s2) / (P1² * M_s1)]^(1/3)\n\nNow, let's plug in the information provided in the problem:\n1.  The host stars have the same radii: R_s1 = R_s2. Therefore, R_s1 / R_s2 = 1.\n2.  The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of the star hosting Planet_2: M_s1 = 2 * M_s2. Therefore, M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2.\n3.  The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: P1 = P2 / 3. Therefore, P2 = 3 * P1, and (P2/P1)² = 3² = 9.\n\nSubstituting these values into the ratio equation:\np1 / p2 = (1) * [9 * (1/2)]^(1/3)\np1 / p2 = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\nThe code output shows that (4.5)^(1/3) is approximately 1.65.\n\nTherefore, p1 / p2 ≈ 1.65, which means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. This makes Planet_1 the preferred target for observation.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
