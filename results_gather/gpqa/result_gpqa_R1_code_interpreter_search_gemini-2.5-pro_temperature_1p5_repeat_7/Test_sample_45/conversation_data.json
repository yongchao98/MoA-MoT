    "1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   **Reactant:** Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. \"Racemic\" means it's an equal mixture of two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n        *   The structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃. The chiral center is at carbon 3.\n    *   **Catalyst:** Grubbs catalyst facilitates olefin metathesis.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a self-metathesis reaction of a terminal alkene. The general form of the reaction is:\n        2 * (R'-CH=CH₂)  ⇌  R'-CH=CH-R' + CH₂=CH₂ (ethene)\n    *   In our case, the R' group is the chiral sec-butyl group, -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The reaction mixture contains both (R)- and (S)- configured sec-butyl groups attached to the vinyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Product:**\n    *   The reaction connects two of the R' groups via a double bond.\n    *   Starting alkene: 3-methylpent-1-ene\n    *   Product (excluding ethene): CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃\n    *   The IUPAC name for this product is **3,6-dimethyl-4-octene**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The product molecule has two chiral centers (C3 and C6) and a double bond (C4=C5) that can exhibit E/Z isomerism.\n    *   Since the starting material is a racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene, three types of coupling reactions can occur:\n        1.  (R)-alkene + (R)-alkene → (3R, 6R)-product\n        2.  (S)-alkene + (S)-alkene → (3S, 6S)-product\n        3.  (R)-alkene + (S)-alkene → (3R, 6S)-product\n\n4.  **Count the Stereoisomers from Each Coupling Type:**\n\n    *   **Case 1 & 2: Homochiral coupling ((R,R) and (S,S))**\n        *   The coupling of two (R)-alkenes gives products with a (3R, 6R) configuration. This can form two different geometric isomers around the new double bond:\n            *   (E)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n            *   (Z)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n        *   These two molecules are diastereomers. Neither has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, so both are **chiral**.\n        *   Similarly, the coupling of two (S)-alkenes gives the (3S, 6S) products:\n            *   (E)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n            *   (Z)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n        *   The (3S, 6S) products are the enantiomers of the (3R, 6R) products. For instance, (E)-(3R,6R) and (E)-(3S,6S) are an enantiomeric pair.\n        *   So, from the homochiral couplings, we get **two pairs of enantiomers**, making a total of **4 distinct stereoisomers**.\n\n    *   **Case 3: Heterochiral coupling ((R,S))**\n        *   The cross-coupling of an (R)-alkene and an (S)-alkene gives products with a (3R, 6S) configuration. (Note: due to the symmetry of the molecule, (3R, 6S) is identical to (3S, 6R)). We must analyze the stereochemistry of the E and Z isomers.\n        *   **(E)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene:** This molecule has a *center of inversion* (i) at the midpoint of the C=C bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. This is a **meso compound**. This is **1 product**.\n        *   **(Z)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene:** This molecule has a *plane of symmetry* (σ) that is perpendicular to the C=C bond and bisects it. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. This is also a **meso compound**. This is **1 product**.\n        *   The two meso compounds are diastereomers of each other and of the chiral isomers.\n\n5.  **Sum the Total Number of Products:**\n    *   From homochiral coupling: 4 chiral stereoisomers (two racemic pairs).\n    *   From heterochiral coupling: 2 achiral meso compounds.\n    *   Total number of possible products = 4 + 2 = **6**.\n\nThese six products are all stereoisomers of 3,6-dimethyl-4-octene and are all chemically distinct compounds.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n*   (E)-(3R,6R) and (E)-(3S,6S) [enantiomeric pair]\n*   (Z)-(3R,6R) and (Z)-(3S,6S) [enantiomeric pair]\n*   (E)-(3R,6S) [meso compound]\n*   (Z)-(3R,6S) [meso compound]\n\nTotal = 6 products.\n\n<<<C>>>"
