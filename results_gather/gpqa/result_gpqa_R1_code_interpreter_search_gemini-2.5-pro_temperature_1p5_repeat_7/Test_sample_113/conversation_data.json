    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction, specifically a cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3 + CN⁻ → CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n    *   This alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to form the final product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3 + H⁺ → CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n    *   Therefore, reagent **A** must be a source of protons (H⁺). The reaction is typically carried out in the presence of a mineral acid like HCl or H₂SO₄, which generates HCN in situ from NaCN and also provides the necessary proton for the final step. H₃O⁺ is the standard representation for an aqueous solution of a strong acid.\n    *   `NaCN + H₃O⁺ ⇌ HCN + Na⁺ + H₂O`\n    *   `Ketone + HCN ⇌ Cyanohydrin`\n    *   So, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires either strong acidic or strong basic conditions, typically with heating. The presence of H₂O in the reaction indicates it's a hydrolysis process.\n    *   `R-C≡N + 2 H₂O --(catalyst)→ R-COOH + NH₃`\n    *   Reagent **B** acts as the catalyst for this hydrolysis.\n    *   Let's evaluate the options for B: HCl and CH₃COOH.\n        *   **HCl** (Hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a very common and effective reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   **CH₃COOH** (Acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it might protonate the nitrile to some extent, it is generally not strong enough to efficiently drive the hydrolysis reaction to completion. Strong mineral acids are required.\n    *   Therefore, **B = HCl** is the suitable reagent.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n    *   Combining these, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
