    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ and determine the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n**1. Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density**\n\nIn natural units, where $\\hbar = c = 1$, the action $S$ is a dimensionless quantity. The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ over spacetime:\n$S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$\n\nThe mass dimension of the spacetime volume element $d^4x$ is $[d^4x]_M = [length]^4 = [mass]^{-4}$. Since the action is dimensionless, $[S]_M = 0$. Therefore, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density must be:\n$[\\mathcal{L}]_M = -[d^4x]_M = -(-4) = 4$.\nAny term in the Lagrangian density must have a mass dimension of 4.\n\n**2. Mass Dimension of the Fields**\n\nWe can deduce the mass dimension of the fields from their kinetic terms.\n\n*   **Fermion field $\\psi$:** The kinetic term for a fermion field is $\\mathcal{L}_{fermion} = \\bar{\\psi} i \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless.\n    *   The derivative operator $\\partial_\\mu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu}$ has a mass dimension of $[\\partial_\\mu]_M = 1$.\n    *   For the term to have a mass dimension of 4, we must have: $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [\\partial_\\mu]_M = 4$.\n    *   Since $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M = [\\psi]_M$, we have $2[\\psi]_M + 1 = 4$.\n    *   Solving for $[\\psi]_M$ gives: $[\\psi]_M = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\n*   **Field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$:** The kinetic term for the gauge field is $\\mathcal{L}_{gauge} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we must have: $[F_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$.\n    *   This implies $2[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$.\n    *   Solving for $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M$ gives: $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2$.\n\n*   **Tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$:** This is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$. Since the gamma matrices are dimensionless constant matrices, their commutator is also dimensionless.\n    *   $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 0$.\n\n**3. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant $\\kappa$**\n\nNow we analyze the given interaction term, which must also have a mass dimension of 4:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$\n\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$\n\nSubstituting the dimensions we found:\n$[\\kappa]_M + \\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \\frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + 3 + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + 5 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M = -1$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n**4. Renormalizability of the Theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants. This is known as power-counting renormalizability.\n\n*   If a coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension, the theory is **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **zero** mass dimension (is dimensionless), the theory is **renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension, the theory is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nSince $[\\kappa]_M = -1$, the theory described by this interaction is non-renormalizable. In perturbation theory, higher-order loop diagrams would involve integrals with increasing powers of momentum in the numerator, leading to divergences that cannot be absorbed into a finite number of counter-terms.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, and the theory is non-renormalizable. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
