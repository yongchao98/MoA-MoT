    "An organic compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for a molecule to be chiral are the presence of a chiral center or axial chirality (like in some biphenyls). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a biphenyl derivative. In biphenyl systems, if the four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are substituted with bulky groups, free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is hindered. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism.\n    *   In this specific molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large nitro groups (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). These bulky groups prevent the two rings from becoming coplanar.\n    *   Due to this restricted rotation, the molecule exists in two stable, non-planar conformations that are mirror images of each other but are non-superimposable.\n    *   For the molecule to be chiral, it must not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Given the substitution pattern (different groups at 2/6 and 2'/6'), the molecule lacks these symmetry elements.\n    *   Therefore, it is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. This compound is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   A carbon atom bonded to four different groups is a chiral center (or stereocenter). Molecules containing a single chiral center are always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers (optical isomers).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is (C₆H₅)₂CO. It has a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   This molecule does not have any chiral centers. The central carbon is sp² hybridized.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   This molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule itself is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Additionally, it possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nThus, the correct option includes only compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
