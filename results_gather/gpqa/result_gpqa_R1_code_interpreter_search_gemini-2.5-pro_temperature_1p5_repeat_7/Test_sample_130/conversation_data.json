    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is key:\n        *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. A signal in this region is typical for vinylic protons (H-C=C-H). A single peak implies all protons are chemically equivalent.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon, C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon, C=O).\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent. The chemical shifts are characteristic for this compound.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a C₅ ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1 and 3, and a methyl group on each of carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. The C5 carbon is a CH₂ group, but this is an error in typical representation, since C1-C4 have methyls, C5 is just a carbon atom with 2 hydrogens. A quick check of the formula shows: C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n    *   The product is a bicyclic compound. The core structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene system.\n    *   Let's verify the molecular formula of the product:\n        *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃).\n        *   This matches the molecular formula given in the problem.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry (Major and Minor Products)**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** Typically, the major product is the *endo* adduct, formed faster (kinetic product) due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. The minor product is the *exo* adduct, which is usually more stable (thermodynamic product).\n    *   **Steric Effects:** However, the diene used here, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. The four methyl groups create significant steric hindrance. In an *endo* approach, the anhydride ring would be positioned under the diene, leading to severe steric clashes with the methyl groups. In an *exo* approach, the anhydride points away, which is sterically much more favorable.\n    *   For highly substituted dienes like this, it's very common for steric hindrance to override the electronic preference, making the **exo adduct the major product**.\n    *   Therefore, we can conclude:\n        *   **Major Product = *exo* adduct**\n        *   **Minor Product = *endo* adduct**\n\n4.  **Analyze the 3D Structure and NOESY Spectra**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect SpectroscopY) detects protons that are close in space (< ~5 Å). The problem states there is a cross-peak in the major product's spectrum that is absent in the minor one. We need to find an interaction unique to the *exo* adduct.\n    *   Let's analyze the proton positions in each adduct:\n        *   **Major (*exo*) Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the *exo* face (away from the C7 bridge). This means the two protons on the anhydride part of the ring (let's call them **H-anhydride**) are oriented on the **endo** face, tucked \"under\" the newly formed six-membered ring.\n        *   **Minor (*endo*) Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the *endo* face. The **H-anhydride** protons are on the **exo** face.\n    *   Now, let's identify key spatial proximities:\n        *   In the **major (*exo*) adduct**, the **endo-oriented H-anhydride protons** are very close to the **vinylic methyl groups** (the ones on the C=C double bond). A strong NOE is expected between them.\n        *   In the **minor (*endo*) adduct**, the **exo-oriented H-anhydride protons** are far from the vinylic methyl groups. No NOE is expected between them.\n    *   This perfectly explains the observation: an NOE cross-peak between the H-anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons will be present in the major (*exo*) product and absent in the minor (*endo*) product.\n\n5.  **Assign NMR Signals and Choose the Correct Option**\n    *   We need to assign the chemical shifts to the protons involved in this distinguishing NOE.\n        *   **H-anhydride protons:** These are two equivalent protons on sp³ carbons adjacent to two carbonyl groups in a rigid bicyclic system. Their chemical shift is typically downfield, around **~3.5 ppm**. They are equivalent, so they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n        *   **Vinylic methyl groups:** These are two equivalent methyl groups attached to a double bond (-C=C-CH₃). Their chemical shift is typically around **~1.7 ppm**. They are equivalent and each is a CH₃, so they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n        *   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** These are two equivalent methyl groups on quaternary sp³ carbons. They are more shielded and appear at a higher field (lower ppm), typically around **~1.0 ppm**. They would also be a **6H singlet**.\n    *   The distinguishing cross-peak connects the H-anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) and the vinylic methyl protons (~1.7 ppm).\n    *   Let's examine the options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n        *   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n    *   Option A perfectly matches our deduction: a cross-peak between the 6H singlet of the vinylic methyls (~1.7 ppm) and the 2H singlet of the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm).\n\n<<<A>>>"
