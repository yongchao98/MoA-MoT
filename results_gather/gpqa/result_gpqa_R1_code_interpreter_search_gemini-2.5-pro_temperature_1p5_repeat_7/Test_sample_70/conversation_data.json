    "*   **1. Understanding the Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (semi-major axis, *a*). This can be expressed as:\n    T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (Planet_4 and Planet_2) in the same system is:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a4)\n\n*   **2. Relating Orbital Distance to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (*P*) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (*a*):\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This can be rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of the period:\n    a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n*   **3. Substituting Kepler's Law into the Temperature Ratio**\n    Now, we can substitute the relationship from Kepler's Third Law into our temperature ratio equation:\n    a2 / a4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3)\n\n    Substituting this back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = √((P2 / P4)^(2/3))\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\n*   **4. Using the Given Orbital Period Ratios**\n    The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods for Planet_1 through Planet_5 as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    From this, we can determine the periods for Planet_2 (P2) and Planet_4 (P4) are in the ratio of 2 and 3.5, respectively (relative to Planet_1).\n    So, the ratio P2 / P4 is:\n    P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n*   **5. Calculation**\n    Now we can calculate the final temperature ratio:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\n    Let's perform the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods P2/P4 is given by the problem statement.\nperiod_ratio_p2_p4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures T_eq4/T_eq2 is (P2/P4)^(1/3).\n# Derivation:\n# T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)  (a is the semi-major axis)\n# T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a4)\n# From Kepler's Third Law, P^2 ∝ a^3, which means a ∝ P^(2/3).\n# a2 / a4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3)\n# Substituting this into the temperature ratio:\n# T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt((P2 / P4)^(2/3)) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio_p2_p4**(1/3)\nprint(f\"{temperature_ratio:.2f}\")\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here's the reasoning and thinking process that leads to the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Physics of Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula for equilibrium temperature is derived from this balance:\n    T_eq = [ L_star * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * a²) ]^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   `L_star` is the star's luminosity.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis (orbital distance).\n\n3.  **Simplify the Relationship for a Ratio:** When comparing two planets in the same system, the star's luminosity (`L_star`) is the same for both. The problem states that the albedo (`A`) is also the same for all planets. The other terms (`π`, `σ`) are constants. Therefore, all terms except the semi-major axis (`a`) cancel out when we take a ratio. The relationship simplifies to:\n    T_eq ∝ (1 / a²)^(1/4)\n    T_eq ∝ 1 / a^(1/2)  or T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\n4.  **Formulate the Temperature Ratio:** Using the simplified relationship, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (1 / √a4) / (1 / √a2)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = √a2 / √a4 = √(a2 / a4)\n\n5.  **Connect Orbital Distance to Orbital Period:** We don't have the orbital distances (`a`), but we do have the ratio of orbital periods (`P`). We can relate `a` and `P` using Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n    P² ∝ a³\n    We can rearrange this to solve for `a`:\n    a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Temperature Ratio:** Now, substitute the relationship from Kepler's Law into our temperature ratio equation:\n    a2 / a4 = (P2)^(2/3) / (P4)^(2/3) = (P2 / P4)^(2/3)\n\n    So, the temperature ratio becomes:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = √[ (P2 / P4)^(2/3) ]\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (P2 / P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\n    By multiplying the exponents (2/3 * 1/2), we get:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:** The problem gives the orbital period ratios as P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    From this, we can find the ratio P2 / P4:\n    P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Now we can plug this value into our final equation. This is a good point to use a calculator or a simple script to ensure accuracy.\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5\n# This means P2/P4 = 2 / 3.5\nperiod_ratio_p2_over_p4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2 is related to the\n# period ratio by (P2 / P4)^(1/3).\n# Derivation:\n# T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(a)  (where 'a' is the semi-major axis)\n# T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a4)\n# Kepler's Third Law: P^2 ∝ a^3 => a ∝ P^(2/3)\n# a2 / a4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3)\n# Substitute this into the temperature ratio:\n# T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt((P2 / P4)^(2/3))\n# T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n# T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\ntemperature_ratio_t4_over_t2 = period_ratio_p2_over_p4**(1/3)\n\n# Print the result rounded to two decimal places to compare with the options.\nprint(f\"{temperature_ratio_t4_over_t2:.2f}\")\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "The relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) and its orbital distance or semi-major axis (*a*) is given by:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₄)\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of a planet's orbital period (*P*) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (*a*):\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nThis can be rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of the period:\n\na ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nNow, we can substitute this relationship into our temperature ratio equation:\n\na₂ / a₄ = (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3)\n\nPlugging this back into the temperature ratio gives:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = √[ (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3) ]\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem states that the orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.
