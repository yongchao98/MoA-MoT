    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding causes the peak to be very broad.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data is consistent with all candidates but does not distinguish between them.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Data - The Splitting Patterns**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the 1H NMR spectrum. We need to find the molecule that has protons with the specific environments required to produce these signals.\n\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means a single proton is being split by three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups of protons.\n    *   `doublet (d)`: implies coupling to **one** neighboring proton (n=1, n+1=2).\n    *   `triplet (t)`: implies coupling to **two** equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3).\n    *   `quartet (q)`: implies coupling to **three** equivalent neighboring protons (n=3, n+1=4).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton (let's call it Hx) with this specific neighborhood: `-CHx - CH(1H) - CH2(2H) - CH3(3H)`. The order `d`, `t`, `q` depends on the relative size of the coupling constants (J-values), so a `dqt`, `tdq`, or `qdt` all point to the same arrangement of neighbors.\n\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means a single proton is being split by three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups of protons.\n    *   `doublet (d)`: implies coupling to **one** neighboring proton.\n    *   `triplet (t)`: implies coupling to **two** equivalent neighboring protons.\n    *   `triplet (t)`: implies coupling to another, different group of **two** equivalent neighboring protons.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton (let's call it Hy) with this specific neighborhood: `-CHy - CH(1H) - CH2(2H) - CH2(2H)`.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Each Candidate Molecule**\n\nLet's examine the structure of each candidate to see if any proton matches the required environments for a `dtt` and a `dtq`. We'll focus on the methine (CH) protons, as they are most likely to have multiple distinct neighbors. For simplicity in this initial analysis, we will treat protons on a `CH2` group as equivalent, which gives rise to triplets in neighboring protons (this is a standard simplifying assumption in introductory NMR, although in reality they are often diastereotopic and give more complex patterns).\n\n**A) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH2-CH(b)(CH3)-CH(c)(CH3)2`\n*   H(b) is adjacent to a CH2 (2H), a CH(c) (1H), and a CH3 (3H). This matches the neighbor requirement (1H, 2H, 3H) for a **dtq** (or tdq).\n*   No proton in this molecule is adjacent to two different CH2 groups. Therefore, it **cannot produce a dtt** signal.\n\n**B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH → 3-ethyl-5-methylhexanoic acid (based on plausible parsing)**\n`HOOC-CH2-CH(b)(C2H5)-CH2-CH(d)(CH3)2`\n*   H(b) is adjacent to three CH2 groups. It would be a `ttt` (triplet of triplets of triplets), not a `dtt`.\n*   This structure does not fit the data.\n\n**C) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3CH2(i)-CH(b)(C2H5)-CH(a)(C2H5)-COOH`\n*   Let's analyze proton H(b) on carbon 3. It is adjacent to:\n    1.  The H(a) proton on carbon 2 (**1H**). This causes a `doublet`.\n    2.  The CH2 group of the ethyl side-chain on carbon 3 (**2H**). This causes a `triplet`.\n    3.  The CH2(i) group on carbon 4 of the main chain (**2H**). This causes another `triplet`.\n*   This environment (neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 2H) is a perfect match for a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n*   Now let's check for a dtq. A proton in one of the diastereotopic CH2 groups, for example in the C2-ethyl group `CH(a)-CH2(f)-CH3(g)`, would be coupled to its geminal partner (1H), the vicinal H(a) (1H), and the vicinal CH3 (3H). This would give a `ddq` (doublet of doublets of quartets), not a `dtq`. However, given that this is the only molecule that can produce the highly specific `dtt` signal, we can be confident this is the correct structure. The `dtq` mentioned might be a description of a complex multiplet that appears like a `dtq` or it's possible that this compound has a signal that fits `dtq` due to other factors.\n\n**D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3CH2(g)-CH(b)(CH3)-CH(a)(CH3)-COOH`\n*   Let's analyze proton H(b) on carbon 3. It is adjacent to:\n    1.  The H(a) proton on carbon 2 (**1H**). `doublet`.\n    2.  The CH2(g) group on carbon 4 (**2H**). `triplet`.\n    3.  The methyl (CH3) group on carbon 3 (**3H**). `quartet`.\n*   This environment (neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 3H) is a perfect match for a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   However, let's check for a `dtt`. No proton in this molecule is adjacent to two different CH2 groups. Therefore, it **cannot produce a dtt** signal.\n\n### **Step 4: Conclusion**\n\n*   Molecule **C** is the only candidate that possesses the structural features to produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** signal.\n*   Molecule **D** is the only candidate that possesses the structural features to produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** signal.\n\nSince the problem states that the NMR spectrum shows *both* a `dtt` and a `dtq` signal, and they are from different protons, there appears to be a contradiction if we strictly follow the simplified analysis for both signals. However, the requirement for a `dtt` signal is structurally very constrained. Only a proton neighbored by a CH, a CH2, and another CH2 can produce this pattern. Only molecule **C** has this feature. The `dtt` is the more definitive and uncommon pattern. Therefore, the compound must be **C**. The signal described as a `dtq` must also arise from this molecule, likely from a more complex multiplet (like a `ddq`) that is being described this way.\n\nThe presence of the `dtt` signal is the deciding piece of evidence.\n\n<<<C>>>"
