    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction:** The problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n\n    *   Formation: $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    *   Dissociation: $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Relate the equilibrium constants:** The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$, also written as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which is for the formation reaction. We need the equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction ($K_d$). The dissociation constant is the inverse of the formation constant.\n\n    *   $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n    *   $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[[CaY]^{2-}]} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We can use an ICE table to track the concentrations of the species as the complex dissociates to reach equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ formed at equilibrium.\n\n| Species       | $[CaY]^{2-}$   | $Ca^{2+}$ | $Y^{4-}$  |\n|---------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Initial**   | 0.02 M        | 0 M       | 0 M       |\n| **Change**    | -x            | +x        | +x        |\n| **Equilibrium**| 0.02 - x      | x         | x         |\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression and solve for x:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the expression for the dissociation constant, $K_d$.\n\n    *   $K_d = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n    Since the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the dissociation constant ($K_d$) is very small. This implies that very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (x << 0.02). We can simplify the equation by making the approximation: `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`.\n\n    *   $\\frac{x^2}{0.02} \\approx 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n    Now, solve for x, which represents the concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n\n    *   $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n    *   $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    *   $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n\nTo make the square root easier, we can write $4 \\times 10^{-13}$ as $40 \\times 10^{-14}$.\n\n    *   $x = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}} = \\sqrt{40} \\times 10^{-7}$\n    *   Since $\\sqrt{36} = 6$ and $\\sqrt{49} = 7$, $\\sqrt{40}$ is approximately 6.3.\n    *   $x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is therefore approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n5.  **Verify the approximation:**\n    Is $x << 0.02$?\n    Is $6.3 \\times 10^{-7} << 0.02$? Yes, the approximation is valid.\n\n6.  **Compare with the options:**\n    A) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    B) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    C) 2.0x10^-2 M\n    D) 6.3x10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\nWe can also use a python script for precise calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\n# Initial stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex\nC_complex_initial = 0.02 # M\n# Formation constant for the Ca-EDTA complex\nK_f = 5e10\n\n# The dissociation reaction is: Ca(EDTA)^2- <=> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-\n# The dissociation constant, Kd, is the inverse of the formation constant.\nK_d = 1 / K_f\n\n# The equilibrium expression is: Kd = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] / [Ca(EDTA)^2-]\n# Let x = [Ca^2+] at equilibrium. From stoichiometry, [EDTA^4-] = x as well.\n# The concentration of the complex at equilibrium will be C_complex_initial - x.\n# So, Kd = x^2 / (C_complex_initial - x)\n# Since Kf is very large, Kd is very small, which means x will be very small compared to C_complex_initial.\n# We can approximate C_complex_initial - x ≈ C_complex_initial.\n# Kd ≈ x^2 / C_complex_initial\n# x^2 ≈ Kd * C_complex_initial\n# x = sqrt(Kd * C_complex_initial)\n\nx = math.sqrt(K_d * C_complex_initial)\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation with one decimal place to match the format of the answer choices.\nprint(f\"{x:.1e}\")\n```\n>>>6.3e-07\n\nThe code confirms the result of the manual calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Understand the Equilibrium:** The Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[CaY]^{2-}$, exists in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, $Ca^{2+}$ and $Y^{4-}$ (where $Y^{4-}$ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA molecule). The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n    *   Formation reaction: $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    *   Dissociation reaction: $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Use the Equilibrium Constant:** We are given the formation constant ($K_f$), which is also called the stability constant ($K_{Ca-EDTA}$).\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    For the dissociation reaction, we need the dissociation constant ($K_d$), which is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[[CaY]^{2-}]} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set Up an ICE Table:** We can track the concentrations of the species at equilibrium. The initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ that forms from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n| Species       | $[CaY]^{2-}$   | $Ca^{2+}$ | $Y^{4-}$  |\n|---------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Initial**   | 0.02 M        | 0 M       | 0 M       |\n| **Change**    | -x            | +x        | +x        |\n| **Equilibrium**| 0.02 - x      | x         | x         |\n\n4.  **Solve the Equilibrium Expression:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression for $K_d$.\n    $K_d = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n    Because $K_f$ is very large, $K_d$ is extremely small. This means that the complex dissociates very little, so 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the simplifying approximation: $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    The expression becomes:\n    $\\frac{x^2}{0.02} \\approx 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n    Now, we solve for x:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n    $x = (\\sqrt{40}) \\times 10^{-7}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} \\, M$\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is x.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated concentration is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option D.\n\nThe \"ideal pH\" assumption simplifies the problem by allowing us to use the absolute formation constant and assume that all uncomplexed EDTA is in the $Y^{4-}$ form, which our calculation correctly does. The provided Python code output of `6.3e-07` confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
