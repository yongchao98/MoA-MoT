    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided by each signal in the spectrum:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of a methyl group (CH3) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), specifically an acetate group (`-OCOCH3`).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is a single peak, meaning these protons are not coupled to any neighboring protons. This confirms the presence of an isolated `CH3-C=O` fragment.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This shift is typical for an allylic methyl group, which is a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (`CH3-C=C`).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, meaning this methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The high chemical shift suggests it is attached to an electron-withdrawing atom, like the oxygen of the acetate group (`=CH-O-`).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** It is coupled to one other proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a very important piece of information. For protons on a double bond, a large coupling constant (typically 12-18 Hz) indicates a **trans** stereochemistry. A smaller coupling constant (6-12 Hz) would indicate a *cis* relationship.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinylic region.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. It is split into a doublet by one adjacent proton and into a quartet by three adjacent protons.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments**\n\nFrom the analysis, we have the following pieces:\n*   An acetate group: `-OCOCH3` (from the 2.1 ppm signal).\n*   A `CH3-CH=` fragment: The `CH3` group is the 1.6 ppm doublet, and it's coupled to the `CH` proton.\n*   A `=CH-O` fragment: The `CH` proton is the 7.0 ppm doublet.\n*   The vinylic proton from the `CH3-CH=` fragment must be the 5.5 ppm signal. It's coupled to the other vinylic proton (giving the doublet part of 'dq') and the allylic `CH3` group (giving the quartet part of 'dq').\n*   The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the two vinylic protons confirms they are in a **trans** arrangement.\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure:\n`CH3(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-OCOCH3(d)` where protons (b) and (c) are trans to each other.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) Cis-propenyl acetate:** This structure has a *cis* double bond. It would show a smaller vinylic coupling constant (J ≈ 6-12 Hz). This does not match the data.\n*   **B) Trans-propenyl acetate:** This structure has a *trans* double bond, which would result in a large vinylic coupling constant (J ≈ 12-18 Hz). This perfectly matches the `J = 16.0 Hz` value from the data. The rest of the predicted signals also match the data.\n*   **C) Cis-butenyl acetate & D) Trans-butenyl acetate:** The molecular formula for butenyl acetate is C6H10O2. It contains 10 protons. The NMR data shows a total integration of 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons. Therefore, these compounds can be ruled out based on the proton count. Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2) has 8 protons, which matches the data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe 1H NMR data, particularly the coupling constant of 16.0 Hz, unequivocally identifies the compound as having a trans-substituted double bond. Combined with the other signal information and the total proton count, the only structure that fits is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
