    "This problem requires us to arrange several substituted benzene compounds in order of the increasing yield of the para-isomer upon electrophilic bromination. The key factors influencing the product distribution in electrophilic aromatic substitution are the electronic and steric properties of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents as Ortho/Para or Meta Directors**\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent based on whether it directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho/para positions or the meta position.\n\n*   **Activating groups (Electron-Donating Groups, EDG)** are ortho, para-directors.\n*   **Deactivating groups (Electron-Withdrawing Groups, EWG)** are generally meta-directors.\n*   **Halogens** are an exception: they are deactivating but are ortho, para-directors.\n\nLet's classify the substituents for each compound:\n1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene): `-CH3` is an alkyl group, which is an activating, **ortho, para-director**.\n2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate): `-COOC2H5` is an ester group with a carbonyl adjacent to the ring. It is a deactivating, **meta-director**.\n3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene): `-Cl` is a halogen. It is deactivating but is an **ortho, para-director**.\n4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene): `-NO2` is a nitro group, which is a strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene): `-C2H5` is an alkyl group, which is an activating, **ortho, para-director**.\n6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid): `-COOH` is a carboxylic acid group with a carbonyl adjacent to the ring. It is a deactivating, **meta-director**.\n\nThe meta-directors will produce very little para-isomer, while the ortho, para-directors will produce a significant amount. Therefore, the overall order will be: (meta-directors) < (ortho, para-directors).\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (Substances 2, 4, 6)**\n\nFor meta-directors, a small percentage of ortho and para products are still formed. The yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group will more strongly direct to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para product.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n`-NO2` (strongest) > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5` (strong)\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing yield of the para-isomer is:\n`C6H5-NO2` (4) < `C6H5-COOH` (6) < `C6H5-COOC2H5` (2)\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Substances 1, 3, 5)**\n\nFor ortho, para-directors, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho substitution. The yield of the para-isomer increases as the steric hindrance of the substituent increases because the bulky group blocks the ortho positions, making substitution at the less hindered para position more favorable.\n\nLet's compare the substituents: `-CH3` (1), `-C2H5` (5), and `-Cl` (3).\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The size of the groups increases in the order `-Cl` < `-CH3` < `-C2H5`. Based on sterics alone, we would expect the para yield to increase in that order. However, electronic effects are also important.\n*   **Electronic Effects & Experimental Data:** While `-CH3` and `-C2H5` are activating groups, `-Cl` is deactivating. The combination of strong inductive withdrawal and resonance donation in halogens makes them exceptionally good at directing to the para position. Experimental data for bromination shows the following approximate para-isomer yields:\n    *   Toluene (`-CH3`, 1): ~62% para\n    *   Ethylbenzene (`-C2H5`, 5): ~63% para (The slightly bulkier ethyl group favors para substitution marginally more than methyl).\n    *   Chlorobenzene (`-Cl`, 3): ~89% para (The electronic nature of the chloro group strongly favors para substitution over ortho).\n\nThus, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these substances is:\n`C6H5-CH3` (1) < `C6H5-C2H5` (5) < `C6H5-Cl` (3)\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Orders**\n\nNow we combine the two ranked lists: (meta-directors) < (ortho, para-directors).\n\n-   Meta-directors order: `4 < 6 < 2`\n-   Ortho, para-directors order: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n`4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
