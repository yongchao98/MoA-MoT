    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the surface defined by the given metric.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Metric and Area Element\n\nThe metric is given in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ as:\n$ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$\n\nThis is a metric of the form $ds^2 = g_{xx}dx^2 + g_{yy}dy^2$, where the metric tensor components are:\n$g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$\n$g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0$\n\nThe area element $dA$ on a surface with metric tensor $g_{ij}$ is given by $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the determinant of the metric tensor $g$:\n$\\det(g) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)^2 - 0 = \\frac{32^2}{(4-x^{2}-y^{2})^2}$\n\nNext, we take the square root of the determinant:\n$\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{32^2}{(4-x^{2}-y^{2})^2}} = \\frac{32}{|4-x^{2}-y^{2}|}$\n\nThe term \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\" suggests that the domain of our coordinates is the disk defined by $x^2+y^2 < 2^2=4$. Inside this disk, the quantity $4-x^2-y^2$ is always positive. Therefore, we can remove the absolute value signs.\n\nThe area element is:\n$dA = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n### 2. Setting up the Area Integral\n\nTo find the total area $A$, we must integrate the area element $dA$ over the entire domain where the metric is defined, which is the open disk $D = \\{(x,y) | x^2+y^2 < 4\\}$.\n\n$A = \\iint_D \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\nThis integral is best evaluated by converting to polar coordinates. Let:\n$x = \\rho \\cos\\theta$\n$y = \\rho \\sin\\theta$\nThen $x^2+y^2 = \\rho^2$, and the area differential becomes $dx \\, dy = \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$.\n\nThe domain of integration in polar coordinates is:\n$0 \\le \\rho < 2$\n$0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$\n\nSubstituting these into the area integral, we get:\n$A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-\\rho^2} \\, \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Integral\n\nWe can separate the integral into two parts:\n$A = \\left( \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\right) \\left( \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho \\right)$\n\nThe first part is straightforward:\n$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = 2\\pi$\n\nThe second part is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2}$ becomes singular as $\\rho$ approaches 2. We evaluate it using a limit:\n$I_\\rho = \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho = \\lim_{R \\to 2^-} \\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho$\n\nWe use the substitution $u = 4-\\rho^2$. Then $du = -2\\rho \\, d\\rho$, which implies $\\rho \\, d\\rho = -\\frac{1}{2}du$.\nThe limits of integration for $u$ are:\n- When $\\rho = 0$, $u = 4-0^2 = 4$.\n- When $\\rho = R$, $u = 4-R^2$.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n$\\int_{4}^{4-R^2} \\frac{32}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}du\\right) = -16 \\int_{4}^{4-R^2} \\frac{1}{u} \\, du$\n$= -16 [\\ln|u|]_{4}^{4-R^2}$\n$= -16 (\\ln|4-R^2| - \\ln|4|)$\n\nSince $R \\to 2^-$, $R<2$, so $4-R^2 > 0$. We can drop the absolute values.\n$= -16 (\\ln(4-R^2) - \\ln(4)) = 16 (\\ln(4) - \\ln(4-R^2))$\n\nNow, we take the limit as $R \\to 2^-$:\n$I_\\rho = \\lim_{R \\to 2^-} 16 \\left( \\ln(4) - \\ln(4-R^2) \\right)$\n\nAs $R \\to 2^-$, the term $4-R^2 \\to 0^+$. The natural logarithm $\\ln(4-R^2) \\to -\\infty$.\nTherefore,\n$I_\\rho = 16 (\\ln(4) - (-\\infty)) = +\\infty$\n\nSince the integral with respect to $\\rho$ diverges to infinity, the total area $A$ is also infinite:\n$A = 2\\pi \\times (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\nThe area of the surface is infinite. Note that while a standard pseudosphere embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ has a finite area, the surface defined by the given intrinsic metric does not. In fact, many models of hyperbolic geometry, such as the Poincar√© disk, have infinite total area.\n\nFinal answer is $+\\infty$. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
