    "*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the nominal molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative abundance of 32%. The ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to the 3:1 ratio characteristic of a compound containing a single chlorine atom (due to its natural isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, with abundances of ~75.8% and ~24.2% respectively).\n    *   So, the molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption band from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group's stretch. This specific frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This chemical shift is in the far downfield region, which is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). The integration of 1H confirms it's a single proton, and it's a singlet because it typically does not couple with other protons.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The splitting pattern provides crucial information about the substitution on the benzene ring. Having two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of this substitution pattern makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent to each other, resulting in two distinct signals.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope), contains one chlorine atom, possesses a carboxylic acid group, and has a *para* substitution pattern on the benzene ring. All spectral data (MS, IR, and ¹H NMR) are perfectly consistent with this structure. The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be the more downfield signal (8.02 ppm), and the two protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be the slightly more upfield signal (7.72 ppm).\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it has the correct molecular weight and functional group, the *ortho* (1,2) substitution would result in a much more complex ¹H NMR spectrum in the aromatic region, with four unique proton signals, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This molecule contains an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR would show an aldehyde proton signal (around 9-10 ppm) instead of the carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm. The IR spectrum would also be different.\n    *   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This molecule is an acid chloride derivative (a chloroformate). It lacks the acidic O-H group, so it would not show the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ or the ¹H NMR peak at 11.0 ppm. Its C=O IR stretch would also be at a higher frequency (>1775 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion:** All evidence points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
