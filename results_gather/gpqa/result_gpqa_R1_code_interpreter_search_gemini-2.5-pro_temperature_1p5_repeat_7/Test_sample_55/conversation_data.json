    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\nThe problem asks about the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0> (denoted as |3,0,0>) to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0> (the ground state, |1,0,0>). The decay happens via a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This means two photons are emitted sequentially.\n\n### 2. Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nFor an E1 transition to occur, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   The change in the principal quantum number, Δn, can be any integer. However, for spontaneous emission (decay), the energy must decrease, so the final n must be smaller than the initial n.\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl, must be ±1. That is, Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm, must be 0 or ±1. That is, Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1.\n\n### 3. Analyzing the First Transition\n*   **Initial State:** |3,0,0> (n=3, l=0, m=0).\n*   **Selection Rule for l:** Since the initial l=0, the intermediate state must have l' = l ± 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 (since l cannot be negative).\n*   **Selection Rule for n:** The energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number of the intermediate state, n', must be less than 3.\n*   **Selection Rule for m:** The initial m=0. The intermediate state's magnetic quantum number, m', must satisfy Δm = m' - 0 = 0, ±1. So, m' can be 0, 1, or -1.\n\nCombining these, the possible intermediate states |n',l',m'> are of the form |n',1,m'> where n'<3 and m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}.\n\n### 4. Analyzing the Second Transition\n*   **Intermediate State:** |n',1,m'>.\n*   **Final State:** |1,0,0> (n=1, l=0, m=0).\n*   **Selection Rule for l:** The final state has l_final = 0. The intermediate state must have l' = l_final ± 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. This is consistent with our finding from the first transition.\n*   **Selection Rule for n:** The energy must decrease in the second step as well, so n' > n_final=1.\n*   **Selection Rule for m:** The final state has m_final = 0. The intermediate state's m' must satisfy Δm = m_final - m' = 0 - m' = 0, ±1. This implies m' can be 0, 1, or -1. This is also consistent.\n\nFrom the constraints on n (1 < n' < 3), the only possible integer value for n' is 2.\nTherefore, the possible intermediate states are:\n*   |2,1,0>\n*   |2,1,1>\n*   |2,1,-1>\n\nThis leads to three possible decay routes:\n1.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n2.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n3.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n\nAll the routes listed in the options are valid based on the selection rules. The core of the question is to determine the probability of a specific route.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios)\nThe \"corresponding probability\" refers to the branching ratio for a specific decay path. Since the intermediate states |2,1,m'> (the 2p states) can only decay to the |1,0,0> ground state (it's the only available lower energy level satisfying Δl=±1), the probability of the second step in the cascade is 1, once the atom reaches the intermediate state.\nTherefore, the overall probability of a specific cascade route is determined entirely by the branching ratio of the first transition: |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>.\n\nThe transition rate (and thus probability) for an atom in a specific state |i> decaying to a specific state |f> is proportional to the square of the transition dipole matrix element:\nΓ ∝ |<f| **d** |i>|² , where **d**=e**r** is the electric dipole operator.\nSince the energy difference between |3,0,0> and any of the degenerate |2,1,m'> states is the same, the relative probabilities only depend on the matrix element term |<2,1,m'| **r** |3,0,0>|².\n\nThe initial state |3,0,0> is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. When a spherically symmetric state decays, it has an equal probability of transitioning to any of the allowed magnetic sublevels (m') of the final state.\nIn our case, the final states for the first step are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. There are three such states. Because the initial state is symmetric (l=0), the decay should be isotropic, meaning each path is equally likely.\n\nSo, the probabilities (branching ratios) are:\n*   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3\n*   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3\n*   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3\n\nA more formal way to see this is using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The probability of a transition from |l,m> to |l',m'> is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient |<l,m; 1,q | l',m'>|², where q=m'-m. For the transition from l=0 to l'=1, all the relevant non-zero Clebsch-Gordan coefficients have a magnitude of 1. Squaring them gives 1, so the probabilities are equal.\nI will run a python script to confirm this.\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum.cg import CG\n\n# The transition probability from |l,m> to |l',m'> is proportional to\n# the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <l,m; 1, q | l',m'> where q = m' - m.\n# Our transition is |l=0, m=0> to |l'=1, m'>. So q = m'.\n\n# For final state m'=0:\ncg0 = CG(j1=0, m1=0, j2=1, m2=0, j3=1, m3=0).doit()\np0 = float(cg0)**2\n\n# For final state m'=1:\ncg1 = CG(j1=0, m1=0, j2=1, m2=1, j3=1, m3=1).doit()\np1 = float(cg1)**2\n\n# For final state m'=-1:\ncg_neg1 = CG(j1=0, m1=0, j2=1, m2=-1, j3=1, m3=-1).doit()\np_neg1 = float(cg_neg1)**2\n\ntotal_p = p0 + p1 + p_neg1\n\n# The branching ratio for each path is its probability divided by the total probability.\nbr0 = p0 / total_p\nbr1 = p1 / total_p\nbr_neg1 = p_neg1 / total_p\n\nprint(f\"Route |3,0,0> -> |2,1,0> -> |1,0,0>: Probability = {br0}\")\nprint(f\"Route |3,0,0> -> |2,1,1> -> |1,0,0>: Probability = {br1}\")\nprint(f\"Route |3,0,0> -> |2,1,-1> -> |1,0,0>: Probability = {br_neg1}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nRoute |3,0,0> -> |2,1,0> -> |1,0,0>: Probability = 0.3333333333333333\nRoute |3,0,0> -> |2,1,1> -> |1,0,0>: Probability = 0.3333333333333333\nRoute |3,0,0> -> |2,1,-1> -> |1,0,0>: Probability = 0.3333333333333333\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation confirms that the branching ratio for each of the three possible paths is 1/3.\n\n### 6. Comparing with Options\nLet's check the given options:\n*   A) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and Probability = 2/3. (Incorrect)\n*   B) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and Probability = 1/3. (Correct)\n*   C) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and Probability = 1/4. (Incorrect)\n*   D) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and Probability = 1/4. (Incorrect)\n\nThe only option that matches our calculation is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the state |n=3, l=0, m=0> to the ground state |n=1, l=0, m=0> through a two-step process, where each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. We need to determine the correct intermediate state and the probability (branching ratio) of that specific decay path.\n\n### 1. Electric Dipole (E1) Transition Selection Rules\nFor a transition to be allowed under the E1 approximation, the quantum numbers must change according to these rules:\n- **Principal quantum number (n):** Δn = any integer. For decay (spontaneous emission), n must decrease.\n- **Orbital angular momentum quantum number (l):** Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1.\n- **Magnetic quantum number (m):** Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Decay Path\nThe decay proceeds in two steps:\n|3,0,0>  →  |n',l',m'>  →  |1,0,0>\n\n**Step 1: Transition from |3,0,0> to the intermediate state |n',l',m'>**\n- **Initial state:** |i> = |3,0,0> (n=3, l=0, m=0).\n- **Applying Δl = ±1:** The intermediate state must have l' = l ± 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 (since l cannot be negative).\n- **Applying Δm = 0, ±1:** The intermediate state must have m' = m + Δm = 0 + Δm, so m' can be 0, 1, or -1.\n- **Applying Δn < 0:** The intermediate state must have n' < 3.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state |n',l',m'> to |1,0,0>**\n- **Final state:** |f> = |1,0,0> (n=1, l=0, m=0).\n- **Applying Δl = ±1:** The intermediate state must have l' = l_final ± 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. This is consistent with the result from Step 1.\n- **Applying Δn < 0:** The intermediate state must have n' > n_final = 1.\n\n**Combining the conditions for the intermediate state |n',l',m'>:**\n- From Step 1, n' < 3.\n- From Step 2, n' > 1.\n- The only integer n' that satisfies 1 < n' < 3 is n'=2.\n- We also know that l'=1 and m' can be -1, 0, or 1.\n\nTherefore, there are three possible intermediate states, and consequently, three possible decay routes:\n1.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n2.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n3.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n\nAll routes listed in the options are valid based on the selection rules. The next step is to determine the probability.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe overall probability of a specific cascade is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>. The transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element |<n',l',m'| **r** |n,l,m>|².\n\nThe initial state |3,0,0> is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric (l=0). When an atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, it has an equal probability of transitioning to each of the available magnetic sublevels (m') of the final state, as there is no preferred direction in space.\nThe available final states for the first step are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. Since there are three equally probable destination states, the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them.\n\n- Probability(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3\n- Probability(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3\n- Probability(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3\n\nThe python code in the thinking process confirms this result using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which formally describe the coupling of angular momenta. The code shows that the probability for each of the three channels is 1/3.\n\nSince the intermediate 2p states (|2,1,m'>) can only decay to the 1s state (|1,0,0>) via an E1 transition, the probability of the second step in the cascade is 1 once the atom reaches the intermediate state. Thus, the total probability for the cascade is simply the probability of the first step.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nLet's evaluate the given options based on our findings:\nA) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and Probability = 2/3. (Incorrect probability)\nB) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and Probability = 1/3. (Correct route and probability)\nC) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and Probability = 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\nD) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and Probability = 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe only correct option is B.\n\nThe transition route is |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and the corresponding probability is \\frac{1}{3}.\n\n<<<B>>>"
