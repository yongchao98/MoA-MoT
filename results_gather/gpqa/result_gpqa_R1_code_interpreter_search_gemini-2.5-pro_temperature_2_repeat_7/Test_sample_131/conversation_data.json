    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Candidate Structures**\nAll four options have the molecular formula C10H14, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data of the 1:1 Mixture**\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integral ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integral ratio.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\nTo solve this, we must first predict the number of signals, multiplicity, and relative integrals for each of the four possible compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They would produce a **single 4H singlet**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups have -CH2- and -CH3- protons. The -CH2- protons would be a quartet and the -CH3- protons would be a triplet due to spin-spin coupling.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is incorrect because it would produce quartets and triplets in the alkyl region, but the problem states all alkyl signals are singlets.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has high symmetry with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (12 protons total) are equivalent. They will produce **one 12H singlet**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes positions 1 and 4 equivalent, 2 and 3 equivalent, and 5 and 6 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Although they are adjacent (ortho), their chemical equivalence often leads to the collapse of the expected doublet into a **single 2H singlet** (a common feature for this specific molecule).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. This results in **two 6H singlets**, giving a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the carbons at positions 2 and 5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at positions 4 and 6 equivalent. This will produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent (a 6H signal). The methyl group at position 2 is unique (a 3H signal), and the methyl group at position 5 is also unique (a 3H signal). This results in **three singlets** with integrals of **6H, 3H, and 3H**, which is a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options for the 1:1 Mixture**\n\nNow, let's test which 1:1 mixture of the valid candidates (the three tetramethylbenzene isomers) would produce the observed spectrum. The total number of alkyl protons in any 1:1 mixture will be 12H + 12H = 24H. The observed 2:1:1 ratio must be applied to this total.\n*   Total ratio parts = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n*   Integral of the signals must be:\n    *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n    *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n\nSo, we are looking for a pair of compounds whose combined alkyl signals produce three singlets with integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's examine the options again. We can exclude any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   Aromatic: Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (1 singlet, 2H) -> **2 singlets, 1:1 ratio.** (This fits).\n    *   Alkyl: Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H) -> This gives a total of **four signals** with integrals 12H, 6H, 3H, 3H (assuming no overlap). This does not match the data \"three signals\".\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) -> This produces **two singlets**. Since the mixture is 1:1 and both signals come from 2 protons, the integral ratio will be **1:1**. This fits the data perfectly.\n    *   **Alkyl:** Durene gives **one 12H singlet**. Prehnitene gives **two 6H singlets**. Combining these gives exactly **three signals** with integrals of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also fits the data perfectly.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   Aromatic: Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (1 singlet, 2H) -> **2 singlets, 1:1 ratio.** (This fits).\n    *   Alkyl: Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H) -> This gives a minimum of 3 signals (if all 6H peaks overlap) of 18H, 3H, 3H, a ratio of 6:1:1. This does not match.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all conditions of the 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
