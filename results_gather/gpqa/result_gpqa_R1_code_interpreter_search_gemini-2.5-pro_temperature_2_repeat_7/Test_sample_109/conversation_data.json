    "Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately 24.6 degrees South.\nW. M. Keck Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately 19.8 degrees North.\n\nA telescope can observe stars with declinations (DEC) within the range of (latitude - 90 deg) to (latitude + 90 deg), although in practice the observable range is smaller due to atmospheric extinction and physical limitations of the telescope mount. For simplicity, we assume an ideal case where a telescope can observe the entire celestial hemisphere visible from its location.\nFor Paranal Observatory (latitude ~ -24.6 deg), the observable declination range is from (-24.6 - 90) = -114.6 deg to (-24.6 + 90) = +65.4 deg. So, -90 deg < DEC < +65.4 deg.\nFor Keck Observatory (latitude ~ +19.8 deg), the observable declination range is from (19.8 - 90) = -70.2 deg to (19.8 + 90) = +109.8 deg. So, -70.2 deg < DEC < +90 deg.\n\nFor a star to be observable from both observatories, its declination must be in the overlapping range of [-70.2, +65.4] degrees.\n\nThe magnitude limits are:\nESPRESSO: apparent V magnitude < 17 mag\nHIRES: apparent V magnitude < 16 mag\nFor a star to be detected by both, it must satisfy the stricter condition: apparent V magnitude < 16 mag.\n\nNow, let's analyze each star:\nStar1: RA = 15 deg and DEC = -75 deg, absolute V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\n*   Declination: DEC = -75 deg. This is outside the observable range for Keck Observatory (-70.2 deg to +90 deg).\n*   Conclusion: Star1 is not observable by both.\n\nStar2: RA = 30 deg and DEC = 55 deg, apparent V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\n*   Declination: DEC = +55 deg. This is within the observable range for both Paranal (-90 deg to +65.4 deg) and Keck (-70.2 deg to +90 deg).\n*   Apparent magnitude: V = 16.5 mag. This does not satisfy the condition V < 16 mag for HIRES.\n*   Conclusion: Star2 is not observable by both.\n\nStar3: RA = 11 h and DEC = 48 deg, apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us.\n*   The problem states the apparent V magnitude is 15.5 mag. We should use this value directly.\n*   Declination: DEC = +48 deg. This is within the observable range for both Paranal and Keck.\n*   Apparent magnitude: V = 15.5 mag. This satisfies the condition V < 16 mag.\n*   Conclusion: Star3 is observable by both.\n\nStar4: RA = 85 deg and DEC = -48 deg, absolute V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\n*   Declination: DEC = -48 deg. This is within the observable range for both Paranal and Keck.\n*   Calculate apparent V magnitude (V):\n    V = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V\n    M = 15.5 mag (absolute V magnitude)\n    d = 10 pc (distance)\n    A_V = R_V * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag (extinction)\n    V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 * 1 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n*   Apparent magnitude: V = 16.74 mag. This does not satisfy the condition V < 16 mag for HIRES.\n*   Conclusion: Star4 is not observable by both.\n\nStar5: RA = 10 h and DEC = 60 deg, absolute V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\n*   Declination: DEC = +60 deg. This is within the observable range for both Paranal and Keck.\n*   Calculate apparent V magnitude (V). Assuming no extinction (E(B-V) = 0).\n    V = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5\n    M = 16.5 mag\n    d = 5 pc\n    V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 = 16.5 + 5 * 0.699 - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995 mag.\n*   Apparent magnitude: V â‰ˆ 15.0 mag. This satisfies the condition V < 16 mag.\n*   Conclusion: Star5 is observable by both.\n\nBased on the analysis, only Star3 and Star5 can be detected with both spectrographs.\n\n<<<B>>>"
