    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State\n\nThe system consists of two electrons, and its state is described in the coupled angular momentum basis as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. Let's break down these quantum numbers:\n*   $l_1 = 1$: The orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron. $l=1$ corresponds to a p-orbital.\n*   $l_2 = 1$: The orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron, also in a p-orbital.\n*   $l = 2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system. This arises from coupling $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$, where the possible values of $l$ are $|l_1-l_2|, ..., l_1+l_2$, which are $0, 1, 2$. The system is specifically in the $l=2$ state.\n*   $m = -1$: The quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. The eigenvalue of the total z-component of angular momentum is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n### 2. Understanding the Measurement\n\nWe are making a joint measurement of the z-components of the angular momentum of each individual electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The possible results for these measurements are given by the eigenvalues $m_{l1}\\hbar$ and $m_{l2}\\hbar$.\n*   Since $l_1=1$, the possible values for $m_{l1}$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n*   Since $l_2=1$, the possible values for $m_{l2}$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n\nThe measurement corresponds to projecting the initial coupled state onto one of the states in the uncoupled basis, which are denoted as $|l_1, m_{l1}\\rangle|l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle$, or more simply as $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$ since $l_1$ and $l_2$ are known.\n\n### 3. Identifying the Target State\n\nThe question asks for the probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n*   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the state with $m_{l1} = -1$.\n*   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the state with $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\nTherefore, the target state after the measurement is the uncoupled state $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$.\n\n### 4. Relating the Initial and Target States (The Core Logic)\n\nThe probability of finding the system in the target state $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$ upon measurement is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product (projection) of the initial state onto the target state:\n\n$P = |\\langle m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe term inside the absolute value, $\\langle m_{l1}, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle$, is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. These coefficients represent the transformation between the coupled and uncoupled bases.\n\nA fundamental rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers equals the total z-component quantum number. That is:\n\n$m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\nLet's check this condition for our specific case:\n*   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we have $m = -1$.\n*   For the target state $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$, we have $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n*   The sum is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\nComparing the required total $m$ from the initial state ($m=-1$) with the total $m$ of the target state ($m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -2$), we see that:\n\n$-1 \\neq -2$\n\nSince the condition $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero:\n\n$\\langle m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle = 0$\n\nThis has a clear physical interpretation. The initial state is an eigenstate of the total z-angular momentum operator $L_z$ with an eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$. The target measurement state is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with an eigenvalue of $(-1-1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) with different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The zero value of the inner product signifies this orthogonality.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Probability\n\nThe probability is the square of the magnitude of this inner product:\n\n$P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is zero. It is an impossible outcome for the given initial state.\n\nTo confirm with a calculation, let's write out the state $|l=2, m=-1>$ in the uncoupled basis. The only terms that can contribute are those where $m_{l1}+m_{l2}=-1$:\n$|l=2, m=-1\\rangle = C_1 |m_{l1}=0, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle + C_2 |m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=0\\rangle$\nThe state we are interested in, $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$, does not appear in this expansion. Hence, its coefficient is 0, and the probability of measuring it is $0^2=0$.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.wigner import clebsch_gordan\nfrom sympy import S\n\n# The question asks for the probability of measuring the state |m1=-1, m2=-1>\n# when the system is in the initial state |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1>.\n# This probability is the squared magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient\n# <l1,m1; l2,m2 | l,m>, which is <1,-1; 1,-1 | 2,-1>.\n\n# The arguments for the sympy function clebsch_gordan are (j1, j2, j, m1, m2, m)\nj1 = S(1)\nj2 = S(1)\nj = S(2)\nm = S(-1)\nm1 = S(-1)\nm2 = S(-1)\n\n# The selection rule m = m1 + m2 is not satisfied (-1 != -1 + -1),\n# so the coefficient must be zero.\ncoefficient = clebsch_gordan(j1, j2, j, m1, m2, m)\n\n# The probability is the square of the magnitude of this coefficient.\nprobability = abs(coefficient)**2\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n<<<D>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the *coupled basis* representation: $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   This tells us:\n        *   Orbital angular momentum of electron 1: $l_1=1$.\n        *   Orbital angular momentum of electron 2: $l_2=1$.\n        *   Total orbital angular momentum of the system: $l=2$.\n        *   The z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum: $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1$. The eigenvalue of the total operator $L_z$ is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n    *   The question asks about a specific measurement outcome. A measurement of the individual components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ projects the system onto a state in the *uncoupled basis*, which is written as $|l_1, m_{l1}\\rangle|l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle$ or simply $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$ since $l_1$ and $l_2$ are known to be 1.\n    *   The specific outcome we are interested in is:\n        *   Eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which means the quantum number for electron 1 is $m_{l1} = -1$.\n        *   Eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which means the quantum number for electron 2 is $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the final state after the hypothetical measurement is $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Relate the States and Find the Probability:**\n    *   In quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a final state $|f\\rangle$ when the system is initially in a state $|i\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection): $P = |\\langle f | i \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   In our case, this is:\n        $P = |\\langle l_1=1, m_{l1}=-1; l_2=1, m_{l2}=-1 | l_1=1, l_2=1, l=2, m=-1 \\rangle|^2$\n    *   The term $\\langle m_{l1}, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n3.  **Apply the Selection Rules (Conservation Law):**\n    *   A fundamental principle in angular momentum coupling is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The total z-component is simply the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed as a selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients: the coefficient is zero unless $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n    *   Let's check this condition for our specific case:\n        *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we have the total z-component quantum number $m = -1$.\n        *   From the final measurement outcome state $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$, we can calculate the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers: $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Comparing the two values, we see that $m \\neq m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ because $-1 \\neq -2$.\n    *   Since this fundamental selection rule is violated, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient must be zero.\n    *   $\\langle m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle = 0$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    *   The probability is the square of the magnitude of the coefficient:\n        $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n    *   This means it is impossible to obtain this specific measurement result from the given initial state. Physically, the total z-component of angular momentum must be conserved. A state with total $m=-1$ cannot be measured to be in a state with a total $m$ of $-2$.\n\n5.  **Confirmation with Code:**\n    *   The `sympy` library in Python has a function to calculate Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which can be used to verify this result. I previously used this code, which confirms the result:\n    ```python\n    from sympy.physics.wigner import clebsch_gordan\n    from sympy import S\n    # The arguments are (j1, j2, j, m1, m2, m)\n    # Here, we want <l1,m1; l2,m2 | l,m> = <1,-1; 1,-1 | 2,-1>\n    coefficient = clebsch_gordan(S(1), S(1), S(2), S(-1), S(-1), S(-1))\n    probability = abs(coefficient)**2\n    # The code prints 0, because the selection rule m=m1+m2 is not met.\n    ```\n    The execution of this code yielded a result of `0`, confirming the theoretical reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability is 0.\n\n<<<D>>>"
