    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule has a ketone functional group at position 3 and a single chiral center at position 5 with a specific (S) configuration.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3`. The chiral center is C5.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H3O+).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3. The hydride anion (H-) from LAH can attack the prochiral carbonyl carbon from two different faces (re and si faces). Since there are no directing groups to favor one side of attack over the other, both possibilities will occur.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3, which can be either (R) or (S). The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction and remains (S).\n    *   Product 1A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 1B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** Since one stereocenter is the same (C5 is S) and the other is different (C3 is R or S), these two products are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetrical diketone and is an achiral molecule.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** Since two chiral centers are formed (C2 and C4), we need to consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has a plane of symmetry in a certain conformation (it is identical to its mirror image, which would be (2S, 4R)). Therefore, it is a **meso compound** and is achiral. The (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) designations describe the same single meso molecule.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** The reduction produces a mixture of three stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and their diastereomer, the meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with normal-phase HPLC.**\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique that separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Separation rules:**\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will **not** be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and **will** be separated.\n    *   Compounds with different molecular formulas or connectivity (like the products of Reaction I vs. Reaction II) have different properties and **will** be separated.\n*   **Counting the peaks:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The product mixture contains the (2R, 4R)/(2S, 4S) enantiomeric pair and the meso compound. The enantiomers will co-elute as one peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will elute separately. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2) and will have different polarities. Therefore, their peaks will not overlap. Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with chiral HPLC.**\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers and other structurally different molecules.\n*   **Separation rules:**\n    *   Enantiomers interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and **will** be separated.\n    *   Diastereomers have different properties and **will** be separated.\n*   **Counting the peaks:** We need to count the total number of unique stereoisomers produced.\n    *   **From Reaction I:** 2 distinct diastereomers were formed. These will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** 3 distinct stereoisomers were formed: the (2R, 4R) enantiomer, the (2S, 4S) enantiomer, and the meso compound. The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers from each other, and it will also separate the meso diastereomer from the enantiomers. This gives **3 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** Each of the 5 compounds in the mixture is chemically distinct and can be separated by an ideal chiral column. Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
