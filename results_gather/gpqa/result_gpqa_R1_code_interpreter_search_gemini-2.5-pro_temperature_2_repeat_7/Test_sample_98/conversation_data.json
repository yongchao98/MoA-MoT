    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n1.  **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the range of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration within a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. The broadness is due to the strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules. This peak often overlaps with the C-H stretching absorptions.\n2.  **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** A strong, sharp peak in the range of 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group. All four possible structures (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information is consistent with all options but doesn't differentiate between them.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n1.  **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to sp²-hybridized carbons of a C=C double bond. All four candidate molecules are saturated alkanoic acids, meaning they contain only single bonds (other than the C=O group), so this observation is also consistent with all options.\n2.  **Signal Multiplicity:** This is the key piece of information for differentiating the structures. The multiplicity (splitting pattern) of a proton's signal is determined by the number of non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbons (n) according to the n+1 rule. When a proton is coupled to multiple *different* groups of protons, its signal is split successively by each group, leading to complex patterns like a \"doublet of triplets.\"\n\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This indicates that the proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (1+1 = **2**, a doublet).\n        *   Two neighboring protons (2+1 = **3**, a triplet).\n        *   Three neighboring protons (3+1 = **4**, a quartet).\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This indicates the proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (1+1 = **2**, a doublet).\n        *   Two neighboring protons (2+1 = **3**, a triplet).\n        *   Another, different group of two neighboring protons (2+1 = **3**, a triplet).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Structure of Each Option**\n\nWe need to find the structure that contains one proton matching the `dtq` environment and another proton matching the `dtt` environment. We will focus on the protons on the chiral centers (methine, -CH- groups) as they are most likely to show such complex splitting.\n\nLet's parse the condensed formulas. We'll label the protons on the main chain's methine groups as **H**_x_ and **H**_y_.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)COOH**\n*   Structure: `CH₃CH₂-CHx(C₂H₅)-CHy(C₂H₅)-COOH`\n*   **H**_y_: Coupled to **H**_x_ (1H, gives doublet), the two protons of its attached ethyl group's -CH₂- (2H, gives triplet), and the COOH proton (1H, which typically doesn't couple or exchanges, so we ignore it for splitting). So, **H**_y_ is a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n*   **H**_x_: Coupled to **H**_y_ (1H, gives doublet), the two protons of the adjacent -CH₂- from the main chain (2H, gives triplet), and the two protons of its attached ethyl group's -CH₂- (2H, gives triplet). So, **H**_x_ is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n*   *Conclusion:* Structure A shows a `dtt` signal but not a `dtq` signal. This is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n*   Structure: `CH₃-CHx(C₂H₅)-CHy(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   **H**_x_: Coupled to the adjacent **H**_y_ (1H, gives doublet), the three protons of the adjacent CH₃ group (3H, gives quartet), and the two protons of its attached ethyl group's -CH₂- (2H, gives triplet). Thus, the signal for **H**_x_ is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n*   **H**_y_: Coupled to the adjacent **H**_x_ (1H, gives doublet), the two protons of the adjacent -CH₂-COOH group (2H, gives triplet), and the two protons of its attached ethyl group's -CH₂- (2H, gives triplet). Thus, the signal for **H**_y_ is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n*   *Conclusion:* Structure B contains protons that would give rise to both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. This is a perfect match.\n\n**C) CH₃CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n*   Structure: `CH₃-CHx(CH₃)-CHy(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   **H**_x_: Coupled to **H**_y_ (1H, gives doublet), the three protons of the main chain's terminal CH₃ group (3H, gives quartet), and the three protons of its attached CH₃ group (3H, gives quartet). This would be a **doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq)**.\n*   **H**_y_: Coupled to **H**_x_ (1H, gives doublet), the two protons of the adjacent -CH₂-COOH group (2H, gives triplet), and the three protons of its attached CH₃ group (3H, gives quartet). The signal for **H**_y_ is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   *Conclusion:* Structure C has a `dtq` signal but not a `dtt` signal. This is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)COOH**\n*   Structure: `CH₃CH₂-CHx(CH₃)-CHy(CH₃)-COOH`\n*   **H**_x_: Coupled to **H**_y_ (1H, gives doublet), the two protons of the main chain's -CH₂- group (2H, gives triplet), and the three protons of its attached CH₃ group (3H, gives quartet). The signal for **H**_x_ is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   **H**_y_: Coupled to **H**_x_ (1H, gives doublet) and the three protons of its attached CH₃ group (3H, gives quartet). The signal for **H**_y_ is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n*   *Conclusion:* Structure D has a `dtq` signal but not a `dtt` signal. This is incorrect.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure **B** has the correct combination of neighboring protons to produce both a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** and a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum. Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
