    "This question requires understanding the relationship between a planet's mass, radius, and density, particularly for rocky planets of similar composition. Let's analyze each option.\n\n**1. Basic Principles:**\n*   **Density (ρ)** is defined as mass (M) per unit volume (V): ρ = M/V.\n*   For a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius.\n*   For rocky planets (like Earth), if you increase the mass while keeping the composition the same, the planet's self-gravity will increase. This increased gravity compresses the materials (rock and iron) more tightly, leading to an overall increase in density.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Options:**\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our reference point. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is almost the same as Earth's density.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** Since this planet is much more massive than Earth, its internal gravity will be much stronger. This stronger gravity will compress the materials (iron core, rocky mantle) significantly more than in Earth. As a result, its average density will be substantially higher than Earth's density. For instance, a rocky planet of 5 Earth masses is predicted by models to have a density around 7-8 g/cm³.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This planet has less mass and therefore weaker self-gravity than Earth. The materials will be less compressed. Consequently, its average density will be lower than Earth's density. A planet with 0.5 Earth masses is predicted to have a density around 4.5-5 g/cm³.\n\n**3. Comparison:**\n\n*   Planet a: Density ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Planet b: Density ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Planet c: Density > 5.5 g/cm³ (significantly higher due to gravitational compression)\n*   Planet d: Density < 5.5 g/cm³ (lower due to less compression)\n\nBy comparing the four options, the planet described in option (c) will have the highest density.\n\n<<<D>>>"
