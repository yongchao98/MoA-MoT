    "The user wants me to identify which of the listed particles is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. Particles associated with spontaneously broken continuous symmetries are known as Goldstone bosons. So, the question is asking to identify which particle is not a Goldstone boson.\n\n1.  **Phonon**: In a crystalline solid, the continuous translational and rotational symmetry of space is broken by the formation of a discrete lattice. The low-energy excitations corresponding to this broken symmetry are sound waves, and their quantized form are phonons. Therefore, phonons are the Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken translational symmetry.\n\n2.  **Magnon**: In a ferromagnet, the Hamiltonian is rotationally invariant. However, in the ground state, all the spins align in a specific direction, thus spontaneously breaking the rotational symmetry (specifically, the SU(2) spin symmetry). The low-energy excitations from this ground state are spin waves, and their quanta are magnons. Therefore, magnons are the Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken spin-rotational symmetry.\n\n3.  **Pion**: In the theory of strong interactions (Quantum Chromodynamics, QCD), for massless up and down quarks, there is a global chiral symmetry, SU(2)L Ã— SU(2)R. This symmetry is spontaneously broken down to the vector subgroup SU(2)V. According to Goldstone's theorem, this should lead to the existence of three massless bosons. These are identified with the three pions ($\\pi^+, \\pi^-, \\pi^0$). Because the up and down quarks are not perfectly massless but have a small mass, the chiral symmetry is only approximate. This makes the pions \"pseudo-Goldstone bosons,\" which have a small but non-zero mass. They are still fundamentally associated with the spontaneously broken symmetry.\n\n4.  **Skyrmion**: A skyrmion is a type of topological soliton. It is a stable, localized, particle-like configuration of a field in certain nonlinear field theories. While they can arise in models that also exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking (like the Skyrme model for nuclear physics, which is an effective theory for QCD with broken chiral symmetry), the skyrmion itself is not the Goldstone boson. Goldstone bosons are the massless (or nearly massless) excitations *of* the broken vacuum, corresponding to fluctuations in the direction of the broken symmetry generators. Skyrmions are topologically non-trivial, massive states and are fundamentally different entities. They are not the direct consequence of Goldstone's theorem.\n\n**Conclusion**: Phonons, magnons, and pions are all examples of Goldstone (or pseudo-Goldstone) bosons arising from different spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. Skyrmions, on the other hand, are topological solitons and are not Goldstone bosons.\n\n<<<B>>>"
