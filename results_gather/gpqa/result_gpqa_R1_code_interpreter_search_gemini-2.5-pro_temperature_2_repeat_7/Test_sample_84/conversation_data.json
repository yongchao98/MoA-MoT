    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Equilibrium Temperature\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from the star and the energy radiated by the planet. The formula is:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $T_*$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_*$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's Bond albedo (reflectivity).\n\n### 2. Finding the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures\n\nWe need to find the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$. Using the formula above:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so $T_*$ and $R_*$ are the same for both) and that they have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes of their orbits, $a_2 / a_1$.\n\n### 3. Relating Doppler Shift to Orbital Parameters\n\nThe problem provides the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) for each planet, which is used to find the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$). The relationship is:\n\n$K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\n\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0}{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n### 4. Finding the Semi-major Axis Ratio\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit ($e=0$), the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) of the star is given by:\n$K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{(M_*+M_p)^{2/3}}$\n\nThis expression is complex. A more direct relation can be found by combining Kepler's Third Law ($P^2 \\propto a^3/M_*$) with the definition of the star's velocity. A simplified and useful form for circular orbits where the planet's mass ($M_p$) is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_*$) is:\n\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_*}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n\nSince both planets were detected via transits, we can assume their orbits are edge-on, meaning the inclination angle $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin i \\approx 1$.\nSo, $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_*}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$.\n\nWe can now solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*} \\frac{G}{a} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_* \\cdot K^2}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G \\cdot M_2^2 / (M_* \\cdot K_2^2)}{G \\cdot M_1^2 / (M_* \\cdot K_1^2)}$\n\nThe gravitational constant $G$ and the star's mass $M_*$ cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_2^2 / K_2^2}{M_1^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n### 5. Calculation\n\nWe have the necessary ratios:\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Velocity ratio: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, substitute these into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n### 6. Final Result\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nTo get the decimal value:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given ratios from the problem description\nM2_over_M1 = 5.0 / 7.0\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# The radial velocity amplitude ratio K1/K2 is equal to the doppler shift ratio\nK1_over_K2 = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# The ratio of semi-major axes a2/a1 is (M2/M1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na2_over_a1 = (M2_over_M1)**2 * (K1_over_K2)**2\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures Teq1/Teq2 is sqrt(a2/a1)\nTeq1_over_Teq2 = math.sqrt(a2_over_a1)\n\nprint(Teq1_over_Teq2)\n```\n\n**Execution Output:**\n```\n0.5357142857142857\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\n\nwhere $T_*$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_*$ is the star's radius, $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 to Planet2, which is $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n$$\n\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}}\n$$\nSince both planets orbit the same star ($T_*$ and $R_*$ are the same) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), the formula simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2 / a_1$.\n\nThe problem provides the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) for each planet, which allows us to find the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$). The ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes ($K$) is directly proportional to the ratio of their respective Doppler shifts:\n$$\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}\n$$\nFor a planet in a circular orbit where the planet's mass ($M_p$) is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_*$), the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) can be approximated as:\n$$\nK \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_*}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}\n$$\nwhere $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the orbital inclination. Since both planets are detected by the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on, so we can assume $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin i \\approx 1$.\n\nSolving for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$$\nK^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_* a} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}\n$$\nNow, we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. Since $G$ and $M_*$ are the same for both planets, they cancel out:\n$$\n\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_2^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_1^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\frac{M_2^2}{M_1^2} \\frac{K_1^2}{K_2^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2\n$$\nWe are given the masses and have calculated the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes:\n- Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n- Velocity ratio: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation for the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$$\n\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}\n$$\nFinally, we can calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n$$\n\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357\n$$\nThe result is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
