    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a given vector field `f`.\n*   **Vector Field:** `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`. This means the field has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and points radially outward from the origin (`r̂` is the radial unit vector).\n*   **Volume of Integration:** A sphere `V` with radius `R` centered at the origin.\n*   **The Integral:** `I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n**2. Choose the Right Tool: The Divergence Theorem**\n\nDirectly calculating the divergence of `f` and then integrating over the volume can be tricky because the field `f` is singular at the origin `r=0` (the function `1/r^2` goes to infinity).\n\nA more elegant and powerful method is to use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that bounds the volume.\n\nMathematically:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `dS` is the outward-pointing differential surface area vector.\n\nThe key advantage here is that the surface `S` is at `r=R`, where the field `f` is perfectly well-behaved (it's not singular).\n\n**3. Set up the Surface Integral**\n\nWe need to evaluate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   **Vector field on the surface S:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n*   **Differential surface area vector dS:** For a sphere in spherical coordinates, the differential area element is `dA = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. Since `dS` must be a vector pointing outward from the surface, its direction is the radial direction `r̂`. Therefore, `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Dot Product**\n\nNow we find the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n`f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [(R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂]`\n\nSince `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the expression simplifies significantly:\n`f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2) * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nNotice that the `R^2` terms cancel out. This is a characteristic feature of `1/r^2` fields and indicates that the flux will be independent of the radius `R` of the sphere.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Integral**\n\nNow we integrate `sin(θ) dθ dφ` over the entire surface of the sphere. In spherical coordinates, this means integrating `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) [ ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ ] dφ`\n\nFirst, evaluate the inner integral (with respect to `θ`):\n`∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]` (from `0` to `π`)\n`= -cos(π) - (-cos(0))`\n`= -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nNow, substitute this result into the outer integral (with respect to `φ`):\n`∫(from φ=0 to 2π) 2 dφ = [2φ]` (from `0` to `2π`)\n`= 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral we wanted to find is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = 4π`\n\nThis result has a physical analogy in electrostatics (Gauss's Law). The field `f` is analogous to the electric field of a point charge at the origin. The integral `∫ (∇ ⋅ f) dV` represents the total charge (source) inside the volume, which is constant regardless of the sphere's radius `R` as long as it encloses the origin.\n\nThe final answer is `4π`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 1\nC) 4π\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe most appropriate answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
