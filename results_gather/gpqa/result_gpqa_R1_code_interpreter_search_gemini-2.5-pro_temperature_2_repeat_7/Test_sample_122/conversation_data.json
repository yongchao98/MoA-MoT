    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference and given values:**\n    *   **Frame S (Galaxy's frame):** This is considered the stationary reference frame for the calculation of the distance.\n    *   **Frame S' (Ejecta's frame):** This is the moving reference frame.\n    *   **Relative velocity (v):** The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is v = 60,000 km/s.\n    *   **Proper time (Δt₀):** The time interval measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is Δt₀ = 50 s.

    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference:**\n\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** We can consider this the \"stationary\" frame of reference. The distance we need to calculate is measured in this frame.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference, traveling at a high velocity relative to the Galaxy's frame.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information:**\n\n*   **Relative velocity (v):** The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the ejecta's moving frame is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock that is at rest in its own frame (the ejecta's frame).\n*   **Speed of light (c):** We will use the standard value `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**3. Determine the Goal:**\n\nWe need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. The formula for distance is:\n\n`Distance = velocity × time`\n\nThe `velocity (v)` is known, but the `time` must be the time that has passed in the Galaxy's frame, not the ejecta's frame.\n\n**4. Apply the Time Dilation Formula:**\n\nAccording to special relativity, time for a moving object (as observed from a stationary frame) passes more slowly than for a stationary object. This effect is called time dilation.\n\nThe time elapsed in the stationary frame (Galaxy's frame, Δt) is related to the proper time in the moving frame (ejecta's frame, Δt₀) by the following equation:\n\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\nWhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**5. Calculation Steps:**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the ratio v/c.**\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the dilated time (Δt) in the Galaxy's frame.**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    `Δt ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n    As expected, slightly more time has passed in the Galaxy's frame than in the ejecta's frame.\n\n*   **Step D: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame.**\n    `Distance = v * Δt`\n    `Distance = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    `Distance = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96)`\n    `Distance = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n\nThe python code output gives a precise calculation for this value: `3061862.178... km`.\n\n**6. Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this result to the given options:\n\n*   A) 2,880,000 km\n*   B) 2,940,000 km\n*   C) 3,060,000 km\n*   D) 3,000,000 km\n\nThe value calculated is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
