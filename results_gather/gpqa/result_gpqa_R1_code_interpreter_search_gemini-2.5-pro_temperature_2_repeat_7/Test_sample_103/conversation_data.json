    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away.\n\nThe formula for the Doppler shift is:\n$\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\nwhere:\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda$ is the change in wavelength.\n*   $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n*   $v_r$ is the radial velocity of the star.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe problem gives the *maximum* periodic wavelength shift. This corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, known as the RV semi-amplitude, $K$.\nSo, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max} \\propto K$.\n\nFrom the data given:\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ miliangstrom\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ miliangstrom\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n### 2. Relate the Star's Velocity to the Planet's Velocity\n\nFor a star and a single planet in a circular orbit, their momentum balance around the common center of mass gives:\n$M_{star} \\cdot v_{star} = M_{p} \\cdot v_{p}$\nwhere $M$ and $v$ are the mass and orbital speed, respectively.\n\nThe observed RV semi-amplitude $K$ is the star's orbital speed viewed along our line of sight: $K = v_{star} \\cdot \\sin(i)$, where $i$ is the inclination of the orbit ($i=90Â°$ for an edge-on orbit).\nSo, $K = \\frac{M_{p}}{M_{star}} v_{p} \\sin(i)$.\n\nThe problem states:\n*   The stars have the same masses: $M_{star, 1} = M_{star, 2}$.\n*   The planets have similar masses: $M_{p, 1} \\approx M_{p, 2}$.\n*   Without information to the contrary, we assume the orbital inclinations are statistically similar, so the $\\sin(i)$ term doesn't introduce a significant difference, or that the phrase \"masses similar to Neptune\" refers to the minimum mass $M_p \\sin(i)$.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the relationship simplifies to:\n$K \\propto v_p$ (the planet's orbital speed).\n\nThis means the ratio of the planet's orbital speeds is the same as the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes:\n$\\frac{v_{p,1}}{v_{p,2}} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n### 3. Relate the Planet's Velocity to its Orbital Period\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force:\n$\\frac{G M_{star} M_p}{a^2} = \\frac{M_p v_p^2}{a}$\nwhere $G$ is the gravitational constant and $a$ is the orbital radius (semi-major axis).\n\nThis simplifies to: $v_p^2 = \\frac{G M_{star}}{a}$\n\nThe orbital period, $P$, is the time it takes to complete one orbit: $P = \\frac{2\\pi a}{v_p}$. We can express $a$ as $a = \\frac{P v_p}{2\\pi}$.\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $a$ back into the velocity equation:\n$v_p^2 = \\frac{G M_{star}}{(\\frac{P v_p}{2\\pi})} = \\frac{2\\pi G M_{star}}{P v_p}$\n\nRearranging for $P$:\n$v_p^3 P = 2\\pi G M_{star}$\n\nSince we are given that the star masses are the same ($M_{star,1} = M_{star,2}$), the term $2\\pi G M_{star}$ is a constant for both systems. Therefore, we have the relationship:\n$P \\propto \\frac{1}{v_p^3}$\n\n### 4. Calculate the Final Ratio\n\nWe want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Using the proportionality from the previous step:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{(1/v_{p,2}^3)}{(1/v_{p,1}^3)} = \\left(\\frac{v_{p,1}}{v_{p,2}}\\right)^3$\n\nFrom step 2, we know that $\\frac{v_{p,1}}{v_{p,2}} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\nNow, we perform the calculation.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio (5/7)^3 to get the final answer.\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_result>\nThe result is approximately 0.364. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Input:**\n    *   **Goal:** Find the ratio of orbital periods, $P_2 / P_1$.\n    *   **Method:** Radial Velocity (RV) method. This method measures the star's velocity towards or away from us.\n    *   **Given Data for System 1:**\n        *   Star mass: $M_{star,1}$ (same as star 2).\n        *   Planet mass: $M_{p,1}$ (similar to planet 2).\n        *   Orbit: Circular.\n        *   Max wavelength shift: $\\Delta\\lambda_{max,1} = 5$ miliangstrom.\n    *   **Given Data for System 2:**\n        *   Star mass: $M_{star,2}$ (same as star 1).\n        *   Planet mass: $M_{p,2}$ (similar to planet 1).\n        *   Orbit: Circular.\n        *   Max wavelength shift: $\\Delta\\lambda_{max,2} = 7$ miliangstrom.\n    *   **Assumptions/Simplifications:**\n        *   $M_{star,1} = M_{star,2} = M_{star}$\n        *   $M_{p,1} \\approx M_{p,2} = M_p$.\n        *   The phrase \"masses similar to Neptune\" implies the minimum mass detected, $M_p \\sin(i)$, is similar for both planets. Since the RV signal depends on this value, it's the most logical interpretation.\n        *   Orbits are circular.\n\n2.  **Relate Observations to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The radial velocity method uses the Doppler effect. The formula is $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$. The maximum wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which we call the RV semi-amplitude, $K$.\n    *   So, $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$ (since the rest wavelength $\\lambda_0$ and the speed of light $c$ are constants).\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max,1}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max,2}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n3.  **Connect Star's Velocity ($K$) to the Planet's Velocity ($v_p$):**\n    *   For a star-planet system, conservation of momentum implies that the star and planet orbit a common center of mass. For a circular orbit, this gives: $M_{star} v_{star} = M_p v_p$.\n    *   The observed velocity $K$ is the component of the star's velocity along our line of sight: $K = v_{star} \\sin(i)$, where $i$ is the inclination of the orbit.\n    *   Substituting $v_{star}$: $K = \\frac{M_p v_p}{M_{star}} \\sin(i) = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}} v_p$.\n    *   Based on our assumptions ($M_{star}$ is the same for both, and $M_p \\sin(i)$ is similar for both), the entire fraction $\\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}}$ is constant between the two systems.\n    *   This leads to a direct proportionality: $K \\propto v_p$.\n    *   So, the ratio of the planets' orbital speeds is the same as the ratio of the K-amplitudes:\n        $\\frac{v_{p,1}}{v_{p,2}} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n4.  **Connect Planet's Velocity ($v_p$) to its Orbital Period ($P$):**\n    *   For a planet in a circular orbit, the gravitational force equals the centripetal force: $\\frac{G M_{star} M_p}{a^2} = \\frac{M_p v_p^2}{a}$, where $a$ is the orbital radius.\n    *   This simplifies to $v_p^2 = \\frac{G M_{star}}{a}$.\n    *   The orbital period is $P = \\frac{2 \\pi a}{v_p}$. We can rearrange this to find the radius: $a = \\frac{P v_p}{2 \\pi}$.\n    *   Now, substitute this expression for $a$ back into the velocity equation:\n        $v_p^2 = \\frac{G M_{star}}{(P v_p / 2\\pi)} = \\frac{2 \\pi G M_{star}}{P v_p}$\n    *   Let's solve for the period, $P$:\n        $P v_p^3 = 2 \\pi G M_{star}$\n    *   Since $G$ is a universal constant and we are told $M_{star}$ is the same for both systems, the right side of the equation ($2 \\pi G M_{star}$) is a constant for both planets.\n    *   This gives us the crucial relationship: $P \\propto \\frac{1}{v_p^3}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    *   We want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$.\n    *   Using the proportionality from step 4: $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{1/v_{p,2}^3}{1/v_{p,1}^3} = \\frac{v_{p,1}^3}{v_{p,2}^3} = \\left(\\frac{v_{p,1}}{v_{p,2}}\\right)^3$.\n    *   From step 3, we know that $\\frac{v_{p,1}}{v_{p,2}} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n    *   Now we can substitute this ratio into our period ratio equation:\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343}$\n    *   To compare with the answer choices, I will calculate the decimal value of this fraction.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio (5/7)^3 to get the final answer.\n# This represents the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1.\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.3644. This value is very close to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
