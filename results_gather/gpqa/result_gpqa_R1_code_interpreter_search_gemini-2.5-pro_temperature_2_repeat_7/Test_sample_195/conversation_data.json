    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the system and conserved quantities.**\n    The system is a 1-dimensional harmonic oscillator. The force is a conservative force, $F = -kx$, derived from the potential energy $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. In a relativistic framework with a conservative force, the total energy of the particle, which is the sum of its relativistic energy $E = \\gamma mc^2$ and its potential energy $U(x)$, is conserved.\n    Let's call this total conserved energy $E_{total}$.\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    This total energy remains constant throughout the motion.\n\n2.  **Analyze the energy at the point of maximum amplitude.**\n    At the maximum amplitude, $x = A$, the mass momentarily comes to rest.\n    *   Position: $x = A$\n    *   Velocity: $v = 0$\n    *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$\n    *   Potential Energy: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n    The total conserved energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the energy at the equilibrium position.**\n    At the equilibrium position, $x = 0$, the potential energy is zero, and the speed of the mass is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n    *   Position: $x = 0$\n    *   Velocity: $v = v_{max}$\n    *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    *   Potential Energy: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$\n    The total conserved energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    The total energy at the maximum amplitude must be equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the maximum velocity, $v_{max}$.**\n    First, let's solve for $\\gamma_{max}$ from the energy equation.\n    Divide by $mc^2$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To isolate $v_{max}$, we perform the following algebraic steps:\n    *   Square both sides of the equation:\n        $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n    *   Take the reciprocal of both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max}^2 = c^2 \\left[ 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2} \\right]$\n        $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n    This matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
