    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the source of radiation:** The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape\" with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. We need to determine the dominant mode of radiation from this source. The oscillation could be a simple rigid motion of the entire spheroid, or a deformation of its shape.\n\n2.  **Consider the multipole expansion of radiation:** Radiation from a localized oscillating source can be described by a multipole expansion. The power radiated by different multipoles has different dependencies on frequency (and thus wavelength) and angle.\n    *   **Electric Dipole (l=1):** `P ∝ ω⁴ ∝ λ⁻⁴`. The angular distribution is `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²θ`.\n    *   **Magnetic Dipole (l=1):** Same wavelength and angular dependence as the electric dipole.\n    *   **Electric Quadrupole (l=2):** `P ∝ ω⁶ ∝ λ⁻⁶`. The angular distribution for an axial quadrupole is `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²θ cos²θ`.\n\n3.  **Interpret the source description:**\n    *   **Case 1: Dipole Radiation.** If the spheroid as a whole oscillates up and down the z-axis, it creates an oscillating electric dipole moment. This is the simplest form of oscillation and is often the dominant form of radiation.\n    *   **Case 2: Quadrupole Radiation.** The explicit mention of the \"spheroid shape\" can be interpreted as a hint that the shape itself is oscillating (e.g., oscillating between prolate and oblate forms). If this shape oscillation is symmetric about the equatorial plane (z=0), the electric dipole moment `p = ∫ zρ dV` will be zero at all times. In this case, the lowest-order non-vanishing radiation comes from the electric quadrupole moment `Q_zz = ∫(3z²-r²)ρ dV`, which will be oscillating. Radiation from sources with higher-order multipoles is typically weaker, but if the lower-order moments are zero due to symmetry, the higher-order terms dominate. The fact that the shape is specified suggests that its geometry is important, favoring the quadrupole interpretation.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the options based on the two models:**\n\n    **Model 1: Electric Dipole Radiation**\n    *   The radiated power function is `f(\\lambda, θ) = C λ⁻⁴ sin²θ`. The dependence is `λ⁻⁴`. This matches options B and C.\n    *   The maximum power `A` occurs when `sin²θ` is maximum, which is `1` (at `θ = 90°`). So `A = C λ⁻⁴`.\n    *   The power radiated at `θ = 30°` is `P₃₀ = C λ⁻⁴ sin²(30°)`.\n    *   `sin(30°) = 1/2`, so `sin²(30°) = 1/4`.\n    *   The fraction of maximum power is `P₃₀ / A = sin²(30°) = 1/4`.\n    *   This gives the result `(1/4, λ⁻⁴)`, which corresponds to **option C**.\n\n    **Model 2: Electric Quadrupole Radiation**\n    *   The radiated power function is `f(\\lambda, θ) = C' λ⁻⁶ sin²θ cos²θ`. The dependence is `λ⁻⁶`. This matches **option A**.\n    *   To find the maximum power `A`, we need to maximize `g(θ) = sin²θ cos²θ = (1/4)sin²(2θ)`. The maximum value of `sin²(2θ)` is 1, which occurs when `2θ = 90°`, so `θ = 45°`.\n    *   The maximum value of `g(θ)` is `g(45°) = sin²(45°)cos²(45°) = (1/√2)²(1/√2)² = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4`. So `A` is proportional to `1/4`.\n    *   The power radiated at `θ = 30°` is proportional to `g(30°) = sin²(30°)cos²(30°) = (1/2)²(√3/2)² = (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16`.\n    *   The fraction of maximum power is `g(30°) / g(45°) = (3/16) / (1/4) = 3/4`.\n    *   This gives the result `(3/4, λ⁻⁶)`, which corresponds to **option A**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We have two plausible models leading to two different options (A and C). The presence of option A, which perfectly matches the predictions for quadrupole radiation, coupled with the otherwise superfluous information about the \"spheroid shape\" (which hints at shape oscillations), strongly suggests that the question is about quadrupole radiation. The problem is likely designed to test the understanding of radiation beyond the simplest dipole case.\n\nLet's verify the calculation for the quadrupole case.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef power_angular_distribution(theta_deg):\n  \"\"\"Calculates the angular part of the quadrupole radiation power.\"\"\"\n  theta_rad = np.deg2rad(theta_deg)\n  return (np.sin(theta_rad)**2) * (np.cos(theta_rad)**2)\n\n# Calculate the value at theta = 30 degrees\npower_at_30 = power_angular_distribution(30)\n\n# The maximum occurs at theta = 45 degrees\nmax_power = power_angular_distribution(45)\n\n# Compute the fraction\nfraction = power_at_30 / max_power\n\nprint(f\"The fraction of the maximum power radiated at 30 degrees is: {fraction}\")\n```\nExecuting the code confirms the result.\nThe angular term at 30 degrees is `sin²(30)cos²(30) = (0.5)² * (√3/2)² = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875`.\nThe maximum angular term (at 45 degrees) is `sin²(45)cos²(45) = (1/√2)² * (1/√2)² = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25`.\nThe fraction is `0.1875 / 0.25 = 0.75 = 3/4`.\n\nThus, the fraction is `3/4` and the wavelength dependence is `λ⁻⁶`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "An oscillating charge distribution radiates electromagnetic waves. The nature of this radiation can be determined by a multipole expansion. The simplest and often dominant forms are electric dipole and electric quadrupole radiation.\n\n1.  **Identify the nature of the radiator:** The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis)\". This description is more detailed than a simple point charge oscillating. An oscillation of the spheroid's *shape* (e.g., oscillating between a prolate and an oblate spheroid) around a spherical mean shape would have no oscillating electric dipole moment due to symmetry. The lowest-order non-vanishing multipole moment would be the electric quadrupole moment. Radiation from an oscillating electric quadrupole is the most likely physical model intended by the problem's description.\n\n2.  **Recall the properties of electric quadrupole radiation:**\n    *   **Wavelength dependence:** The total power radiated by an electric quadrupole is proportional to the sixth power of the frequency (ω⁶). Since wavelength `λ = 2πc/ω`, the power is proportional to `λ⁻⁶`. This matches options A.\n    *   **Angular dependence:** For an oscillating axial quadrupole (symmetric around the z-axis), the radiated power per unit solid angle `dP/dΩ` has an angular dependence given by `f(θ) ∝ sin²θ cos²θ`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the fraction of maximum power:**\n    *   The function describing the angular dependence of the power is `g(θ) = sin²θ cos²θ`.\n    *   We first need to find the angle `θ_max` at which the radiated power is maximum. This occurs when `g(θ)` is at its maximum. We can rewrite `g(θ)` using the identity `sin(2θ) = 2sinθcosθ`:\n        `g(θ) = (1/4) * (2sinθcosθ)² = (1/4)sin²(2θ)`\n    *   The maximum value of `sin²(2θ)` is 1, which occurs when `2θ = 90°`, so `θ_max = 45°`.\n    *   The maximum power `A` is proportional to `g(45°) = (1/4)sin²(90°) = 1/4`.\n    *   Now, we calculate the power radiated at the given angle, `θ = 30°`:\n        `Power at 30° ∝ g(30°) = sin²(30°) cos²(30°)`\n    *   We know `sin(30°) = 1/2` and `cos(30°) = √3/2`.\n    *   Therefore, `g(30°) = (1/2)² * (√3/2)² = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16`.\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power `A` is the ratio of the power at `30°` to the maximum power:\n        `Fraction = g(30°) / g(45°) = (3/16) / (1/4) = (3/16) * 4 = 3/4`.\n\n4.  **Combine the results:**\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **3/4**.\n    *   The possible form of the wavelength-dependent part of `f` is **λ⁻⁶**.\n    *   These two results match option A.\n\n*Alternative Consideration (Electric Dipole):*\nIf we were to incorrectly model this as a simple electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the power would be `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²θ` and the wavelength dependence would be `λ⁻⁴`.\n*   Maximum power is at `θ = 90°` (`sin²(90°) = 1`).\n*   Power at `θ = 30°` is proportional to `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n*   The fraction would be `(1/4)/1 = 1/4`. This corresponds to option C, `(1/4, λ⁻⁴)`.\nHowever, as argued in step 1, the specific description of the source makes the quadrupole model the intended interpretation.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The fraction is 3/4 and the form of f is proportional to λ⁻⁶.\n\n<<<A>>>"
