    "This problem requires us to calculate the minimum distance a particle $X^0$ travels before it decays, such that we can observe at least 30% of such decay events. This distance corresponds to the minimum resolution of the detector.\n\n**1. Understand the decay process and probability:**\nThe decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The fraction of particles that have *not* decayed after a time $t$ in a given reference frame is given by $P_{survive}(t) = e^{-t/\\tau}$, where $\\tau$ is the mean lifetime in that frame.\nConsequently, the fraction of particles that *have* decayed by time $t$ is $P_{decay}(t) = 1 - e^{-t/\\tau}$.\n\nThe problem states we want to observe at least 30% of the decays. This translates to finding the time $t$ (and the corresponding distance) for which $P_{decay}(t) \\ge 0.3$.\n$1 - e^{-t/\\tau} \\ge 0.3$\n$0.7 \\ge e^{-t/\\tau}$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$\\ln(0.7) \\ge -t/\\tau$\n$- \\ln(0.7) \\le t/\\tau$\n$t \\ge -\\tau \\ln(0.7)$\n\nThe minimum time, $t_{min}$, required to see 30% of the decays is $t_{min} = -\\tau \\ln(0.7)$.\n\n**2. Relativistic effects:**\nThe particle $X^0$ is moving at a relativistic speed in the Bubble Chamber (the lab frame). Its lifetime is subject to time dilation.\nThe lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame (proper lifetime) is given as $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\nThe lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau$, is dilated by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):**\nThe Lorentz factor is the ratio of the total energy ($E$) to the rest energy ($E_0 = m_0c^2$).\nGiven:\nTotal energy, $E = 27$ GeV\nRest mass, $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV/$c^2$, which means the rest energy $E_0 = 3.41$ GeV.\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{E_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}$\n\n**4. Calculate the distance (resolution):**\nThe distance the particle travels in the lab frame during a time $t_{min}$ is $d_{min} = v \\times t_{min}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity in the lab frame.\nThe velocity $v$ is related to the Lorentz factor by $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$. For a highly energetic particle like this one, its velocity $v$ will be very close to the speed of light, $c$.\n\nLet's combine the equations:\n$d_{min} = v \\times t_{min} = v \\times (-\\tau \\ln(0.7)) = v \\times (-\\gamma \\tau_0 \\ln(0.7))$\n\nFor highly relativistic particles ($\\gamma \\gg 1$), the velocity $v$ is extremely close to $c$.

    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning and calculation process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physics Principles\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle has decayed by a certain time `t` in a given reference frame is given by:\n    $P_{decay}(t) = 1 - e^{-t/\\tau}$\n    where $\\tau$ is the mean lifetime of the particle in that reference frame.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Time Dilation:** The particle $X^0$ is moving at a high speed.

The relationship is:\n    $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest energy ($E_0 = m_0c^2$).\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{E_0}$\n\n4.  **Distance of Travel:** The distance `d` a particle travels in the lab frame is related to its velocity `v` and the time of travel in the lab frame `t_lab`:\n    $d = v \\times t_{lab}$\n\n5.  **Mean Decay Length (L):** The average distance a particle travels before decaying in the lab frame is called the mean decay length, `L`.\n    $L = v \\times \\tau_{lab}$\n\n### 2. Literal Interpretation and Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe **at least 30% of the decays**. This means we need to find the distance `d` such that the probability of decay within this distance is 0.3.\n\nThe probability of decay within a distance `d` is:\n$P_{decay}(d) = 1 - e^{-d/L} = 0.3$\n\nSolving for `d`:\n$e^{-d/L} = 0.7$\n$-d/L = \\ln(0.7)$\n$d = -L \\times \\ln(0.7)$\n\nNow, let's calculate the values needed for this formula.\n\n**Given:**\n*   Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Total energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest mass, $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV/$c^2$, which means rest energy $E_0 = 3.41$ GeV.\n*   Speed of light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n**Step-by-step calculation:**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{E_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n2.  **Calculate the particle's velocity factor ($\\beta = v/c$):**\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{7.918^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.01595} \\approx 0.992$\n\n3.  **Calculate the mean decay length (L):**\n    $L = v \\times \\tau_{lab} = (\\beta c) \\times (\\gamma \\tau_0)$\n    $L = 0.992 \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times 7.918 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $L \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n4.  **Calculate the required distance `d` for 30% decay:**\n    $d = -L \\times \\ln(0.7) = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-0.3567)$\n    $d \\approx 6.72 \\times 10^{-7}$ m\n\nThis calculation can be verified using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\ntau0 = 8e-16  # s\nE = 27.0      # GeV\nm0 = 3.41     # GeV/c^2\nc = 3e8       # m/s\n\n# 1.

However, this value does not match any of the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\nThis situation often arises in multiple-choice questions when there is an error in the problem statement or the options. Let's reconsider the problem.\n\nOption D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is numerically close to our calculated **mean decay length** $L$ ($1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The discrepancy is about 10%. It is plausible that the question contains a small typo in the given numbers (mass or energy) and that the intended question was to find the mean decay length, with the \"30% decay\" part being a distractor.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. If the mass were $m_0 = 3.1$ GeV instead of $3.41$ GeV:\n*   $\\gamma = 27 / 3.1 \\approx 8.71$\n*   $L = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} \\ c \\ \\tau_0 = \\sqrt{8.71^2-1} \\times (3 \\times 10^8) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16}) \\approx 2.076 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nThis result, $2.076 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, matches option D almost perfectly. Therefore, it's highly probable that the question intended to ask for the mean decay length and provided slightly inconsistent numbers. Given the choices, the most reasonable answer is the one that corresponds to the mean decay length calculated from values very close to the ones provided.\n\nFinal Answer is based on identifying that the mean decay length with slightly adjusted input values is the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum track length (resolution) a detector must be able to measure to successfully identify at least 30% of the decay events of particle $X^0$.\n\n### 1. Interpretation of the Question\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.\" A particle's decay is \"observed\" by a detector if the particle leaves a track of a certain minimum length before it decays. If it decays too quickly, the track is too short to be resolved from the point of creation.\n\nTherefore, \"observing a decay\" means the particle must travel a distance `d` greater than or equal to the detector's resolution, $d_{res}$. We want the fraction of particles that satisfy this condition to be at least 30%.\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive (do not decay) after traveling a distance `d` is given by the exponential decay law in terms of distance:\n$P_{survive}(d) = e^{-d/L}$\nwhere $L$ is the mean decay length of the particle in the lab frame.\n\nWe require this survival probability to be at least 30% (0.3). To find the maximum resolution that allows this, we set the probability to the minimum required value:\n$e^{-d/L} = 0.3$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-d/L = \\ln(0.3)$\n$d = -L \\times \\ln(0.3)$\n\nThis distance `d` represents the largest possible \"minimum resolution\" that still allows for the observation of 30% of the decays.\n\n### 2. Calculation of Mean Decay Length (L)\nThe mean decay length `L` in the lab frame depends on the particle's proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$), its velocity ($v$), and relativistic effects (time dilation, captured by the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$).\n\n**a. Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor is the ratio of the total energy (E) to the rest energy ($E_0 = m_0c^2$).\nGiven:\n*   Total energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest mass, $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV/$c^2$, so the rest energy $E_0 = 3.41$ GeV\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{E_0} = \\frac{27}{3.41}$\n\n**b. Calculate the mean decay length (L)**\nThe mean decay length is $L = v \\times \\tau_{lab}$, where $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$ is the dilated lifetime in the lab.\nWe can also write this as $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0$, where $\\beta = v/c$.\nUsing the relation $pc = \\beta E$, we can find a more precise form: $L = \\frac{p}{m_0c}c\\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2}c\\tau_0$.\nLet's first calculate $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$, then combine them.\n\nThe full calculation is:\n1.  $\\gamma = E/E_0$\n2.  $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$\n3.  $v = \\beta c$\n4.  $L = \\gamma v \\tau_0$\n5.  $d = -L \\ln(0.3)$\n\nLet's use a Python script to perform this calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\ntau0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nE = 27.0  # Energy in GeV\nm0 = 3.41  # Rest mass in GeV/c^2\nc = 3e8  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# 1.

Final Answer Selection\n\nThe calculation gives a required resolution of $d = 2.269 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\nLet's compare this to the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\nOur calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is closest to option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The approximately 9% difference likely stems from a small imprecision in the values given in the problem statement (e.g., the mass or energy).

    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimum track length that a significant fraction of the $X^0$ particles will travel before decaying. This track length is the resolution the detector must have. The problem specifies we need to observe \"at least 30% of the decays\".\n\n### Interpretation of the question\n\nThe phrasing \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\" can be interpreted as finding the track length `d` such that the probability of a particle traveling *at least* this distance before decaying is 30%. A detector with resolution `d` can only measure tracks of this length or longer.\n\nThe probability that a particle travels a distance `d` or more before decaying follows the exponential decay law:\n$P(\\text{distance} \\geq d) = e^{-d/L}$\nwhere `L` is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\nWe are given that this probability must be at least 30% (or 0.3):\n$e^{-d/L} \\ge 0.3$\n\nTo find the largest possible value for the resolution `d` that satisfies this, we solve the equality:\n$e^{-d/L} = 0.3$\n$\\ln(e^{-d/L}) = \\ln(0.3)$\n$-d/L = \\ln(0.3)$\n$d = -L \\times \\ln(0.3)$\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest energy ($E_0 = m_0c^2$).\n    -   Total Energy, E = 27 GeV\n    -   Rest Energy, E₀ = 3.41 GeV\n    \n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{E_0} = \\frac{27}{3.41}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L)**: The mean decay length in the lab frame is the distance a particle travels on average before decaying. It is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by:\n    $L = v \\times \\tau_{lab} = v \\times (\\gamma \\tau_0)$\n    where `v` is the particle's velocity and $\\tau_{lab}$ is the time-dilated lifetime. For a highly relativistic particle, its velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`.

The slight difference (around 9%) is likely due to small imprecisions in the numbers provided in the problem statement, which is a common occurrence in physics exercises. No other option is of the correct order of magnitude. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
