    "The user wants to know which fundamental symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT).\n\n**1. Analyze SMEFT's foundations:**\nSMEFT is an effective field theory that extends the Standard Model (SM) by adding higher-dimensional operators. It is built upon the same fundamental principles as the SM itself, namely that it should be a local, relativistic quantum field theory.\n\n**2. Evaluate each symmetry:**\n\n*   **1. Lorentz Symmetry:** This is the symmetry of spacetime under rotations and boosts. It is a fundamental postulate of special relativity and a cornerstone of all modern quantum field theories, including the Standard Model. Any consistent relativistic quantum field theory, including SMEFT, must be Lorentz invariant. Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian are constructed to be Lorentz scalars. **This symmetry must be respected.**\n\n*   **2. Poincare Symmetry:** This is a broader spacetime symmetry that includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) as well as spacetime translations (invariance under changes in position and time). Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry is a fundamental requirement for any theory consistent with special relativity. It ensures that the laws of physics are the same everywhere and at all times. All terms in the SMEFT Lagrangian, by construction, must respect Poincare symmetry. **This symmetry must be respected.**\n\n*   **3. CP Symmetry:** This is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P) symmetry. The Standard Model itself is known to violate CP symmetry, as observed in the weak interactions (for example, in the decay of kaons and B mesons). Since the underlying SM Lagrangian already contains CP-violating terms (the complex phase in the CKM matrix), there is no requirement for the new higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT to respect this symmetry. In fact, SMEFT provides a framework for parametrizing additional sources of CP violation from new physics at high energies. **This symmetry is NOT required to be respected.**\n\n*   **4. CPT Symmetry:** This is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time Reversal (T). The CPT theorem is a very general and powerful result in quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined CPT transformation. Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, the CPT theorem applies. **This symmetry must be respected.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not a required symmetry. Therefore, the correct combination is 1, 2, and 4.\n\nLooking at the options:\nA) 1, 2, 4\nB) 1, 2\nC) 3, 4\nD) 1, 3, 4\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
