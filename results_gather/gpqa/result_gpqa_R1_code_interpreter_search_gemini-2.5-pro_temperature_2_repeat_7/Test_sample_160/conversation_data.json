    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Define λ1:** The problem states that λ1 is the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves before the electron beam is active. This path is determined by gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules. The mean free path (MFP) in this case is given by the formula:\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_gg` is the kinetic collision cross-section for gas molecule-gas molecule collisions. This cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n\n2.  **Define λ2:** The problem states that λ2 is the mean free path of the electrons from the beam, which is determined by the electrons scattering off the gas molecules.\n\n3.  **Initial (Naive) Analysis:** A first-level analysis would compare a single electron projectile with a single gas molecule target.\n    *   An electron is a tiny, point-like particle.\n    *   A gas molecule (like N2 or O2) is much larger.\n    *   A high-energy (1000 kV) electron is moving extremely fast and sees the gas molecule as mostly empty space. For the electron to be scattered, it must pass very close to the atomic nucleus or an inner-shell electron.\n    *   In contrast, two gas molecules are like two large, fluffy balls that collide if their outer electron clouds touch.\n    *   This implies that the scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a neutral molecule (σ_e-neutral) is much *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section for two molecules hitting each other (σ_gg).\n    *   If this were the whole story, since MFP is inversely proportional to the cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ), a smaller cross-section would lead to a longer mean free path. This would mean λ2 >> λ1. However, the problem describes an \"intriguing observation,\" suggesting a more complex phenomenon is at play.\n\n4.  **The Critical Effect of the Electron Beam:** The key to solving this problem lies in understanding what happens \"upon initiating the electron beam.\" A high-energy electron beam is a powerful source of ionization. As the electrons in the beam travel through the sample chamber, they will collide with and strip electrons from the residual gas molecules, creating positive ions.\n    *   **Initial state (beam off):** The chamber contains only neutral gas molecules.\n    *   **Operating state (beam on):** The chamber contains a mixture of neutral gas molecules and positive gas ions. The electron beam is now traveling through this partially ionized gas (a plasma).\n\n5.  **Re-evaluating the Cross-Sections:** We must now consider the new composition of the target gas.\n    *   The cross-section relevant for λ1 (molecule-molecule) remains `σ_gg`, as this is the baseline state.\n    *   The cross-section relevant for λ2 is now the *effective* cross-section for an electron scattering off the mixture of neutrals and ions.\n    *   The scattering cross-section for a charged particle (the electron) interacting with another charged particle (the gas ion) is governed by the long-range and strong Coulomb force. This electron-ion cross-section (`σ_e-ion`) is vastly *larger* than both the electron-neutral cross-section (`σ_e-neutral`) and the neutral molecule-molecule kinetic cross-section (`σ_gg`).\n    *   Even if only a small fraction of the gas molecules are ionized, their enormous scattering cross-section can dominate the overall scattering process for the electron beam. The effective scattering cross-section, `σ_effective`, becomes significantly larger than `σ_gg`.\n\n6.  **Comparing λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   λ1 is inversely proportional to the kinetic cross-section `σ_gg`.\n    *   λ2 is inversely proportional to the effective cross-section `σ_effective`.\n    *   Since the beam's ionization effect makes `σ_effective` > `σ_gg`, the mean free path for the electrons will be shorter than the mean free path for the gas molecules.\n    *   A larger cross-section means collisions are more frequent, leading to a shorter mean free path.\n    *   Therefore, we can conclude that λ2 < λ1.\n\nThis phenomenon, where the beam itself creates ions that in turn increase the scattering rate and degrade the beam, is a well-known issue in particle accelerators and electron microscopes, often referred to as ion trapping or beam-induced pressure rise.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The ionization of residual gas by the electron beam drastically increases the scattering cross-section encountered by the electrons. This larger cross-section results in a shorter mean free path.\n\n<<<D>>>"
