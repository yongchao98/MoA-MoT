    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Particle Decay:**\n    The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The number of undecayed particles `N` at a time `t` is given by `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`, where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `τ` is the mean lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame (the lab frame).\n\n2.  **Apply Special Relativity (Time Dilation):**\n    The problem involves particles moving at ultra-relativistic speeds. According to the theory of special relativity, a moving clock runs slower as observed from a stationary frame. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The mean lifetime of the particles as measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is longer than their proper lifetime (`τ_proper`) in their own rest frame. The relationship is given by:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, defined as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Decay Equation in the Lab Frame:**\n    In the lab frame, the decay equation becomes:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_lab) = N₀ * exp(-t / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\n4.  **Determine the Time of Flight:**\n    The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector with a radius `R = 30` meters. They travel at ultra-relativistic speeds, meaning their velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall (`t_flight`) is:\n    `t_flight = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Fraction of Surviving Particles:**\n    The fraction `F` of particles that reach the detector wall is the fraction that has not decayed during the time of flight `t_flight`. We can find this by substituting `t = t_flight` into the decay equation:\n    `F = N(t_flight) / N₀ = exp(-t_flight / (γ * τ_proper))`\n    `F = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ_proper))`\n\n6.  **Use the Given Information to Set Up Equations:**\n    We are given two scenarios:\n    *   **Scenario 1:** When the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, the fraction of surviving particles is `F₁ = 1/3`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * c * τ_proper))`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** We need to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` for which the fraction of surviving particles is `F₂ = 2/3`.\n        `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * c * τ_proper))`\n\n7.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    Let's take the natural logarithm of the general fraction equation:\n    `ln(F) = -R / (γ * c * τ_proper)`\n    The term `R / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant for this particle and detector. Let's call it `K`.\n    `ln(F) = -K / γ`  or `γ = -K / ln(F)`\n    We can set up a ratio between the two scenarios to eliminate the constant `K`:\n    `γ₂ / γ₁ = (-K / ln(F₂)) / (-K / ln(F₁))`\n    `γ₂ / γ₁ = ln(F₁) / ln(F₂)`\n    Now, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = γ₁ * (ln(F₁) / ln(F₂))`\n\n8.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    Substitute the known values into the equation:\n    *   `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   `F₁ = 1/3`\n    *   `F₂ = 2/3`\n\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`\n\n    To get the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ngamma_1 = 20\nF1 = 1/3\nF2 = 2/3\n\n# From the derivation, we have the relationship:\n# gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(F1) / ln(F2)\ngamma_2 = gamma_1 * math.log(F1) / math.log(F2)\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n\n>>>\n54.19860228393041\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor `γ₂` is approximately 54.2. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 54\nB) 28\nC) 40\nD) 68\n\nThe closest answer is 54.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem relates the survival fraction of relativistic particles to their Lorentz factor.\n\nHere's the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Particle Decay and Relativity**: The fraction of particles, *F*, that survive after a time *t* in the lab frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    F = N(t)/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)\n    where *N₀* is the initial number of particles, *N(t)* is the number at time *t*, and *τ_lab* is the particle's mean lifetime as measured in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation**: Due to special relativity, the lifetime of a particle moving at a high velocity is dilated from the perspective of a stationary observer (in the lab frame). The lab-frame lifetime *τ_lab* is related to the proper lifetime *τ_proper* (the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor, *γ*:\n    τ_lab = γ * τ_proper\n\n3.  **Time of Flight**: The particles travel from the center of the detector to the inner wall, a distance equal to the radius, *R* = 30 m. Since they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed *v* is approximately the speed of light, *c*. The time of flight *t* in the lab frame is:\n    t ≈ R / c\n\n4.  **Combining the Equations**: Substituting the expressions for *τ_lab* and *t* into the decay equation:\n    F = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))\n\n5.  **Setting up a Relationship**: Let's take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(F) = - (R / (c * τ_proper)) / γ\n    The term *R / (c * τ_proper)* is a constant for this particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant *K*.\n    ln(F) = -K / γ\n    Rearranging, we get:\n    γ * ln(F) = -K\n    This means the product of the Lorentz factor and the natural logarithm of the survival fraction is a constant.\n\n6.  **Using the Given Scenarios**: We have two scenarios:\n    *   Scenario 1: γ₁ = 20, F₁ = 1/3\n    *   Scenario 2: γ₂ = ?, F₂ = 2/3\n\n    From the relationship derived in step 5, we can write:\n    γ₁ * ln(F₁) = γ₂ * ln(F₂)\n\n7.  **Solving for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂) **:\n    γ₂ = γ₁ * (ln(F₁) / ln(F₂))\n    Now, we plug in the given values:\n    γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))\n\n8.  **Calculation**: Using the properties of logarithms, ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b) and ln(1/a) = -ln(a):\n    ln(1/3) = -ln(3)\n    ln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3)\n    So, γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))\n    γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\n    The provided code execution confirms this calculation:\n    `gamma_2 = 20 * math.log(1/3) / math.log(2/3) ≈ 54.19`\n\n9.  **Conclusion**: The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) 54\n    B) 28\n    C) 40\n    D) 68\n\n    The closest value is 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"
