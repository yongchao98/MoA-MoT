    "*   **Analysis of the concept:** The question asks to identify which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (due to restricted rotation about a bond, as seen in atropisomers). A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Analysis of Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n    *   The molecule is substituted at the ortho-positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6') with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n    *   The large size of these ortho substituents creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings.\n    *   This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a twisted conformation where the two rings are not in the same plane. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism, which is a form of axial chirality.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Analysis of Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the carbon bonded to the hydroxyl group).\n    *   This carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since this carbon atom is attached to four different groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter).\n    *   A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Analysis of Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   The structure is (C6H5)2C=O.\n    *   The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. It is sp2-hybridized and only bonded to three groups, so it cannot be a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule possesses a C2 axis of rotation that passes through the C=O bond. More importantly, it possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings (when they are twisted) and contains the C=O group.\n    *   Due to the presence of this plane of symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Analysis of Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a *trans* configuration around the carbon-carbon double bond. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.\n    *   The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry, which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n    *   Furthermore, this specific molecule has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion means the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Compound 1 is chiral (atropisomerism).\n    *   Compound 2 is chiral (chiral center).\n    *   Compound 3 is achiral.\n    *   Compound 4 is achiral.\n\n    The compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
