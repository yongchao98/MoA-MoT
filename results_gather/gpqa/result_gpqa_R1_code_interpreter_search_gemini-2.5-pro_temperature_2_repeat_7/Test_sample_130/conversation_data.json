    "**1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (Anhydride):** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak (δ=7 ppm) and two ¹³C NMR peaks (δ=137 ppm, δ=165 ppm).\n    *   The single ¹H peak indicates two equivalent vinylic protons. The shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons in an electron-deficient system.\n    *   The ¹³C peaks at 165 ppm and 137 ppm correspond to carbonyl carbons and alkene carbons, respectively, in an anhydride ring.\n    *   This highly symmetric structure is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n    *   This is a cyclic, conjugated diene. The base formula for cyclopentadiene is C₅H₆. Replacing four hydrogens on the double-bond carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) with methyl groups gives a formula of C₅H₂ (from the ring) + 4×(CH₃) = C₉H₁₄.\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Diels-Alder reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   The reaction yields a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the problem statement.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. According to the endo rule, the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored, major product. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically favored, minor product.\n    *   **Major product = *endo* adduct**\n    *   **Minor product = *exo* adduct**\n\n**2. Structure of the Products and Proton Assignments**\n\nLet's visualize the structures of the *endo* and *exo* products and assign the protons based on the provided NMR data.\n\nThe product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n*   The original maleic anhydride protons become two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring. They are adjacent to carbonyls, so their chemical shift will be downfield. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** corresponds to these protons (**Hₐ**).\n*   The four methyl groups from the diene end up in two different environments in the product:\n    *   Two methyl groups are at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). These are tertiary alkyl methyls. The **6H singlet at ~1 ppm** corresponds to these bridgehead methyls (**Me_bh**).\n    *   Two methyl groups are on the double bond (C5 and C6). These are vinylic methyls. The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** corresponds to these vinylic methyls (**Meᵥ**).\n*   The CH₂ group of the cyclopentadiene becomes the C7 methylene bridge of the bicyclic product. The two protons of this bridge are diastereotopic (they are in different chemical environments). They are designated as *syn* (pointing towards the double bond) and *anti* (pointing away from the double bond). The *syn* proton is typically shielded and appears at a higher field. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** is characteristic of one of these bridge protons (**H_syn**), being a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other bridge proton.\n\n**3. Analysis of the NOESY Spectra**\n\nNOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) reveals protons that are close to each other in 3D space (< 5 Å). We need to find an NOE interaction that is present in the *endo* product (major) but absent in the *exo* product (minor).\n\n*   ***Endo* Adduct (Major Product):** In the *endo* conformation, the anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the main bicyclic framework, on the same side as the C7 bridge (*syn* to the bridge). This brings the anhydride protons (**Hₐ**) very close to the *syn* proton on the C7 bridge (**H_syn**). Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak between **Hₐ** and **H_syn** is expected.\n\n*   ***Exo* Adduct (Minor Product):** In the *exo* conformation, the anhydride ring is oriented \"above\" the main bicyclic framework, on the opposite side of the C7 bridge (*anti* to the bridge). In this arrangement, the anhydride protons (**Hₐ**) are far from the C7 bridge protons. No NOE between **Hₐ** and **H_syn** is expected. Instead, the **Hₐ** protons are now close to the vinylic methyls (**Meᵥ**).\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product. Based on our analysis, this unique cross-peak corresponds to the spatial interaction between the anhydride protons (**Hₐ**) and the *syn*-bridge proton (**H_syn**), which only occurs in the *endo* isomer.\n\n*   The signal for **Hₐ** is the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   The signal for **H_syn** is the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nThe question asks which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak. The correct answer must be the pair corresponding to these two signals.\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (**Me_bh**) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (**H_syn**). Plausible interaction, but should be present in both isomers.\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (**Me_bh**) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (**Meᵥ**). Plausible interaction, but should be present in both isomers.\nC) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (**H_syn**) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (**Hₐ**). This is the key NOE that is present only in the major (*endo*) product. This matches the question's description.\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (**Meᵥ**) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (**Hₐ**). This NOE is characteristic of the minor (*exo*) product, not the major product.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>"
