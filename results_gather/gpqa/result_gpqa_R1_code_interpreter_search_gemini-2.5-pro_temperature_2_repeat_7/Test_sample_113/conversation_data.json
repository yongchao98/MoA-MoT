    "*   **Analysis of the First Reaction:**\n    *   **Reactants:** butan-2-one (a ketone), NaCN (sodium cyanide), and reagent 'A'.\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (a cyanohydrin).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic cyanohydrin formation reaction. In this reaction, a cyanide group (-CN) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) are added across the C=O double bond of a carbonyl compound (aldehyde or ketone).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate. The alkoxide ion is then protonated to form the final hydroxyl group.\n    *   **Role of Reagent 'A':** The reaction requires a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. While hydrogen cyanide (HCN) can be used directly, it is highly toxic and volatile. A safer and more common laboratory practice is to generate HCN *in situ* by reacting a cyanide salt (like NaCN) with an acid. The acid provides the necessary H⁺. The options for 'A' are NaHSO₃ and H₃O⁺.\n        *   `NaHSO₃` (sodium bisulfite) forms a solid adduct with ketones, which is a different reaction primarily used for purification. It is not the standard reagent for creating the acidic conditions needed for cyanohydrin synthesis.\n        *   `H₃O⁺` (hydronium ion) represents an acidic aqueous solution (e.g., dilute HCl or H₂SO₄). This is the correct choice as it provides the protons needed to protonate the intermediate and drive the reaction to completion.\n    *   **Conclusion for 'A':** A = H₃O⁺.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Second Reaction:**\n    *   **Reactant:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile (a nitrile).\n    *   **Reagents:** Reagent 'B' and H₂O (water).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid (a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis involves the addition of water across the carbon-nitrogen triple bond. This reaction is typically very slow and requires either a strong acid or a strong base as a catalyst, along with heat.\n    *   **Role of Reagent 'B':** 'B' must be a catalyst for the hydrolysis. The options for 'B' are CH₃COOH and HCl.\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it could technically catalyze the reaction, the process would be extremely slow and likely incomplete.\n        *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a standard reagent used for the efficient and complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. The reaction is typically performed by refluxing the nitrile in aqueous HCl.\n    *   **Conclusion for 'B':** B = HCl.\n\n*   **Final Decision:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the suitable reagent for the first reaction is A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   The suitable reagent for the second reaction is B = HCl.\n    *   Combining these, we get A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
