    "The problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge q. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. Key Definitions and Concepts\n\n*   **Source:** A point charge q.\n*   **Trajectory:** The position of the charge at any time $t'$ is given by $\\vec{s}(t')$.\n*   **Velocity:** The velocity of the charge is $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt'}$.\n*   **Observation Point:** The potentials are measured at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n*   **Retarded Time ($t_r$):** The electromagnetic field experienced at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ was generated by the charge at an earlier time, $t_r$. This \"retarded time\" is such that the time difference $(t - t_r)$ is exactly the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   **Retarded Position:** The position of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}_r = \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   **Separation Vector:** The vector from the retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}_r$. Its magnitude is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   **Retardation Condition:** The relationship between these quantities is given by $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n*   **Retarded Velocity:** The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n\n### 2. General Formulas for Retarded Potentials\n\nFor a general time-dependent charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$, the scalar and vector potentials are given by:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r' = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the retarded time for a source element at $\\vec{r}'$.\n\n### 3. Application to a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t')$, the charge and current densities can be written using the Dirac delta function:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals gives:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\dfrac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{v}(t_r') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThese integrals are non-trivial because the retarded time $t_r'$ inside the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A standard (but complex) evaluation of this integral yields a correction factor related to the Doppler effect. The result of this evaluation is:\n\n$\\int \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r')) d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n\nwhere the subscript \"ret\" indicates all quantities are evaluated at the single retarded time $t_r$ determined by $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|/c$.\n\n### 4. Derivation of the Scalar Potential (V)\n\nPlugging the result of the integration into the expression for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\nUsing our definitions, $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| = d$. So,\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}\\right)} = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by c:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 5. Derivation of the Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$)\n\nSimilarly for the vector potential, the velocity $\\vec{v}(t_r')$ is evaluated at the retarded time and comes out of the integral:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\vec{v}}{d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}\\right)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi \\left(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}\\right)}$\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by c:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 6. Comparison with Options\n\nLet's compare our results with the given options:\n\n*   **A)** and **B)** use static potentials, which are incorrect as they neglect the finite speed of light (retardation).\n*   **C)** has a plus sign in the denominator ($dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$), which is incorrect. The minus sign arises physically from the Doppler effect. If the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), the fields are stronger, which corresponds to a smaller denominator. A plus sign would give the opposite, incorrect effect.\n*   **D)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. This matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials perfectly.\n\nAs a consistency check, notice that $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v}}{1} V$. Since $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0)$, this means $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$, a known relation for Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The expressions in option D satisfy this relationship.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
