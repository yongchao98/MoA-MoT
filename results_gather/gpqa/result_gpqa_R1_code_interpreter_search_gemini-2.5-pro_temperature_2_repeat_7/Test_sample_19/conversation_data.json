    "This question is about the impulse approximation in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of the approximation and then evaluate each of the four statements.\n\n**The Impulse Approximation (IA)**\n\nThe core idea of the impulse approximation is that for a high-energy probe interacting with a nucleus, the interaction happens with a single nucleon over a very short time scale. This time is so short that the struck nucleon doesn't have time to interact with the other nucleons in the nucleus. In essence, during the brief moment of the collision, the nucleon behaves as if it were a free particle, not bound within the nucleus. The \"impulse\" is the large momentum transfer from the probe to the nucleon.\n\nNow let's analyze the given assumptions in this context:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is a foundational requirement for the impulse approximation. If the interaction involved multiple nucleons at once (e.g., through meson-exchange currents) or the nucleus as a collective entity, the fundamental premise of a clean, single-nucleon event would be violated. Thus, the interaction must be with a single, quasi-free nucleon. This assumption is **essential**.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This concerns what happens before and after the primary interaction. It assumes that the incoming probe reaches the target nucleon without being scattered by other nucleons, and the outgoing nucleon (and/or scattered probe) leaves the nucleus without any further interactions (these are called final-state interactions or FSI). While the core impulse approximation is about the instant of collision (covered by assumption 4), for the *entire process* to mimic a free-nucleon interaction, this \"transparency\" is necessary. In its simplest form, this is known as the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA). Without this assumption, the observed result would be complicated by rescattering events. This assumption is **essential** for the approximation to be practically applied in its simplest form and to make the bound system behave like a free one.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This statement is about the internal structure of the nucleon itself, describing it as a composite object of quarks. Whether the quarks inside the nucleon are treated as relativistic or non-relativistic is a separate modeling choice. It has no direct bearing on how the nucleon as a whole interacts with its surrounding nucleons or with the external probe. The impulse approximation deals with the nucleon as the fundamental degree of freedom, not its internal constituents. Therefore, this assumption is **not relevant** to the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This is the very definition and heart of the impulse approximation. It's the \"frozen nucleus\" approximation. The interaction is assumed to be so rapid (high momentum transfer) that the potential energy binding the nucleon to the nucleus is negligible compared to the interaction energy. For that brief instant, the nucleon's kinematics are governed as if it were a free particle, uninfluenced by the nuclear potential. This assumption is **essential**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTo make a nuclear interaction behave like a free-nucleon interaction, we need to assume:\n*   The interaction is with only one nucleon (Assumption 1).\n*   The nucleon is effectively free from its binding potential *during* the short interaction (Assumption 4).\n*   The probe and ejected particle are not affected by the other nucleons on their way in or out (Assumption 2).\n\nTherefore, assumptions 1, 2, and 4 jointly imply the impulse approximation.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
