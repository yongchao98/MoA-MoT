    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material (C8H9NO) from the NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation. This leaves one more degree of unsaturation, likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the other signals.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H-NMR signals:**\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a CH2 group), according to the n+1 rule. This suggests a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH2 group. The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it's coupled to a single adjacent proton (a CH group). This is consistent with the `-CH2-CHO` fragment, where the CH2 protons are coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets with an integration of 2H each, which is a classic pattern for a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring. The upfield chemical shifts (compared to benzene at 7.3 ppm) suggest the ring is substituted with at least one electron-donating group.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of an amine group (-NH2). The protons are exchangeable, leading to a broad signal. An amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the structure:**\n    We have a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring with an -NH2 group and a -CH2CHO (ethanal) group as the two substituents. Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (benzene ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n\n    The starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    This is a standard reaction for converting a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is transformed into a diazonium group (-N2+Cl-). The aldehyde group remains unchanged.\n    *   Product of Step 1: **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    Diazonium salts are generally unstable and, when warmed in water, undergo hydrolysis. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a common method to synthesize phenols from anilines.\n    *   Product of Step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    The product from step 2, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde that has protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- protons). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-aldol condensation.\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an alpha-proton to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion.\n        `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH- <=> [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]- + H2O`\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives the aldol addition product.\n        Addition Product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option B).\n    3.  **Dehydration:** The reaction is performed with **heat**. This provides the energy to eliminate a molecule of water from the aldol addition product. The acidic proton on the alpha-carbon (C2) is removed, and the hydroxyl group on the beta-carbon (C3) leaves, forming a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        `3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal --(Heat, -H2O)--> 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal`\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product.**\n\nThe term \"Heat\" is a key piece of information, indicating that the reaction proceeds to the final, dehydrated condensation product, not stopping at the intermediate addition product. The final product is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed after the elimination of water.\n\nThe structure of the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option D.\n\nLet's check the IUPAC name and structure for option D:\n*   Name: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**\n*   This name describes a 4-carbon chain (`but-`) with an aldehyde (`-al`) at C1 and a double bond between C2 and C3 (`-2-en`). There are 4-hydroxyphenyl substituents on C2 and C4.\n*   Structure: `(HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH=C(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)`. This structure is the result of the dehydration of the aldol addition product, as deduced above.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the entire reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
