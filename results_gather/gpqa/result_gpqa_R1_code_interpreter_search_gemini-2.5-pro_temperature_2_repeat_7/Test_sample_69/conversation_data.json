    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical riddle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the knowns:** The problem describes a series of chemical reactions and asks for the molecular symmetry point group of product E. We have four options: A) C2v, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2. The key is to identify the chemical compounds A through H.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the clues:**\n    *   **Reaction 1:** `A(solid) + 8 B(gas) -> C(bright red)`\n    *   **Reaction 2:** `C + 2 D(gas) -> E(extremely hazardous)`\n    *   **Reaction 3:** `C + H₂O -> A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`\n    *   **Reaction 4:** `D + B -> H(solvent)` (in a 1:1 ratio)\n\n3.  **Focus on the most unique clues:**\n    *   **Reaction 3 is the most revealing.** The hydrolysis of compound `C` regenerates the starting solid `A` and produces two different acids, one strong (`F`) and one weak (`G`).\n    *   The regeneration of `A` suggests a disproportionation or a reduction reaction where the central atom of `C` returns to its elemental state `A`. This implies `A` is a relatively noble/unreactive element, like a noble metal or a non-metal like Iodine or a noble gas.\n    *   The formation of a strong acid and a weak acid is a classic fingerprint for the hydrolysis of a mixed compound, especially a mixed halide. The pair **strong acid (e.g., HCl, HBr, HI, HIO₃)** and **weak acid (e.g., HF)** is a very strong indicator. If `F` and `G` were `HIO₃` and `HF`, this would point to the elements in `C` being Iodine and Fluorine.\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis: If hydrolysis produces `HIO₃` (strong acid) and `HF` (weak acid), then compound `C` must be an iodine fluoride. The reaction would be the hydrolysis of `IF₅`: `IF₅ + 3 H₂O → HIO₃ + 5 HF`. However, this reaction does *not* regenerate solid `Iodine (I₂)`. So this path is incorrect.\n\n    *   Let's reconsider the hydrolysis reaction. The only common reactions where an element is reformed upon hydrolysis involve noble gas compounds. Let's examine xenon fluorides:\n        *   `2 XeF₂ + 2 H₂O → 2 Xe + 4 HF + O₂`. This reforms Xenon (`A=Xe`, but it's a gas, not a solid). It produces only one acid, `HF` (weak).\n        *   `3 XeF₄ + 6 H₂O → 2 Xe + XeO₃ + 12 HF + 1.5 O₂`. This reaction **reforms Xenon (A)**. It also produces `HF` (a weak acid, so `G=HF`). The other product, `XeO₃`, is the anhydride of xenic acid (`H₂XeO₄`), a reasonably strong acid, and is also extremely hazardous (explosive). So we can tentatively assign `F = H₂XeO₄`.\n        *   This reaction path seems highly plausible, despite `A` being a gas (perhaps the puzzle allows for solid xenon under cryogenic conditions, or this is a small inaccuracy in the puzzle statement). If this path is correct, it implies that **compound C is related to XeF₄**.\n\n4.  **Identify Compound E:** The prompt is constructed to lead to the identification of `E`. Given the clue \"extremely hazardous product\" and our tentative identification of the system involving Xenon chemistry, a likely candidate for `E` is `XeF₄` itself or a related compound. `XeF₄` is a powerful fluorinating agent and its hydrolysis product, `XeO₃`, is a contact explosive, making `XeF₄` fall into the \"extremely hazardous\" category.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E = XeF₄:**\n    *   First, determine the molecular geometry of Xenon Tetrafluoride (`XeF₄`) using VSEPR theory.\n    *   Xenon (Xe) is the central atom. It is in Group 18, so it has 8 valence electrons.\n    *   It forms single bonds with 4 Fluorine (F) atoms.\n    *   Electrons used in bonding: 4.\n    *   Electrons remaining as lone pairs: 8 - 4 = 4.\n    *   Number of lone pairs: 4 / 2 = 2.\n    *   Total number of electron domains (bonding pairs + lone pairs) is 4 + 2 = 6.\n    *   The electron geometry for 6 domains is octahedral.\n    *   To minimize repulsion, the two lone pairs will occupy positions opposite to each other (axial positions). The four fluorine atoms will occupy the positions in the plane between the lone pairs (equatorial positions).\n    *   This arrangement results in a **square planar** molecular geometry.\n\n6.  **Assign the Point Group for a Square Planar Molecule (like XeF₄):**\n    *   Principal axis (`Cₙ`): There is a `C₄` axis passing through the Xe atom, perpendicular to the plane of the molecule.\n    *   Perpendicular `C₂` axes: Yes, there are four `C₂` axes in the plane of the molecule. Two pass through opposite F atoms, and two bisect the F-Xe-F angles. Since there are `C₂` axes perpendicular to the `C₄` axis, this molecule belongs to the **D** set of point groups.\n    *   Horizontal mirror plane (`σh`): Yes, the plane containing all the atoms is a horizontal mirror plane.\n    *   The presence of a `Cₙ` axis and a `σh` plane defines the **Dnh** point group. In this case, with a `C₄` axis, the point group is **`D4h`**.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The compound E is identified as XeF₄, whose molecular symmetry group is D4h. This matches option B. While the provided riddle has some parts that are ambiguous or potentially contain inaccuracies (e.g., \"solid A\" for Xenon, the 1:8 stoichiometry), the central clues strongly point toward xenon chemistry, and `XeF₄` is the only choice that has `D4h` symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
