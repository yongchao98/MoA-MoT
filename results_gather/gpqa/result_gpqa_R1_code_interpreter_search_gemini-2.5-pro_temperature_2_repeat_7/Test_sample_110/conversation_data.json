    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone. To find the nucleophilic site, we must identify the acidic α-hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n        *   The C2 position is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon. It has **no** α-hydrogens.\n        *   The C6 position is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It has **one** α-hydrogen.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base. Its role is to deprotonate the most acidic proton to form an enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a ketone enolate and an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound in the presence of a base is a **Michael addition**.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Enolate Formation.** The t-BuOK base will abstract the only available α-hydrogen from the C6 position of the cyclohexanone. This forms a nucleophilic enolate anion.\n    *   **Step 2: Michael Addition.** The enolate (nucleophilic at C6) attacks the electron-deficient β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   **Step 3: Protonation.** The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated during the workup step to yield the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The resulting structure has an `—CH₂—CH₂—COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we should identify the principal functional group. The ester has higher priority than the ketone. However, given the complexity and the options provided, the naming convention treats the propanoate chain as the parent and the cyclohexanone ring as a substituent.\n    *   Let's follow this convention:\n        *   **Parent Chain:** ethyl propanoate. The new substituent is on C3.\n        *   **Substituent:** The cyclohexyl ring. For naming the substituent, numbering starts at the point of attachment. The point of attachment is the old C6 of the ketone. Let's call this C1' of the substituent ring.\n            *   **C1'**: Has a methyl group and is the point of attachment.\n            *   **C2'**: (The old C1 of the ketone) has the carbonyl group (=O), so it is a `2-oxo` group.\n            *   **C3'**: (The old C2 of the ketone) has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n        *   Combining the substituent names: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   **Final Name for A:** Putting it all together, the product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\nThis matches the name for product A in options C and D.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH, H₂O**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The nitro group (NO₂) is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the protons on the adjacent carbon (the α-carbon) acidic.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base used to deprotonate the 1-nitropropane. Water (H₂O) serves as the solvent and proton source for the final step.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as crotononitrile, is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is another **Michael addition**. The anion of the nitroalkane (a nitronate) acts as the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Carbanion Formation.** KOH removes an acidic α-proton from C1 of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion). `CH₃CH₂CH⁻—NO₂`\n    *   **Step 2: Michael Addition.** The carbanion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (the `CH` bonded to the methyl group). A new C-C bond forms.\n    *   **Step 3: Protonation.** The intermediate anion is protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The reaction connects C1 of 1-nitropropane to C3 of the butenenitrile skeleton.\n    *   **Structure:** `CH₃CH₂—CH(NO₂) —CH(CH₃)—CH₂—CN`\n    *   To name this product, we find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n        *   **Principal Functional Group:** Nitrile. The carbon of the CN group is C1.\n        *   **Parent Chain:** The longest chain including C1 is 6 carbons long. Therefore, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n        *   **Numbering and Substituents:**\n            *   C1: -CN\n            *   C2: -CH₂-\n            *   C3: has a -CH₃ (methyl) group.\n            *   C4: has a -NO₂ (nitro) group.\n            *   C5: -CH₂-\n            *   C6: -CH₃\n    *   **Final Name for B:** The full name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis matches the name for product B in options A and D.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option D contains both correct products.\n\n<<<D>>>"
