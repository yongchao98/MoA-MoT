    "This problem requires us to systematically determine the structure of a substituted benzene molecule based on a detailed description and then correctly name it according to IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\n**1. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Molecule**\n\nThe molecule contains several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde / Formyl (-CHO)\n*   Cyano / Nitrile (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl / Alcohol (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n\n**2. Determine the Positions of Substituents**\n\nWe are given the relative positions of all substituents. Let's place them on the benzene ring, starting with C1 for the -COOH group.\n\n*   **Para (to C1):** A methoxy group is para to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is C4.\n    *   **C4: -OCH3**\n*   **Meta (to C1):** A carbaldehyde (-CHO) and a cyano group (-CN) are meta to the carboxylic acid. The meta positions are C3 and C5. The problem also states they are meta to each other, which C3 and C5 are. So, {C3, C5} must be {-CHO, -CN}.\n*   **Ortho (to C1):** A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are ortho to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, {C2, C6} must be {-OH, -N(CH3)2}.\n*   **Key Constraint:** \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) must be ortho to it, so the -CN group must be at either C3 or C5.\n    *   The alcohol (-OH, hydroxyl group) must also be ortho to the -CN group.\n    *   **Case 1: -CN is at C3.** It is ortho to C4 (-OCH3). For the -OH group to be ortho to it, the -OH group must be at C2. This works.\n    *   **Case 2: -CN is at C5.** It is ortho to C4 (-OCH3). For the -OH group to be ortho to it, the -OH group must be at C6. This also seems to work.\n\n**3. Resolve the Ambiguity using IUPAC Numbering Rules**\n\nAt first glance, it seems two different molecules could fit the description. However, the IUPAC naming system is designed to give a unique name to every molecule, which includes a specific numbering scheme.\n\n*   The principal group (-COOH) is at C1.\n*   The locants for the substituents will be {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} regardless of the arrangement. This creates a tie in the \"lowest locant set\" rule.\n*   **Tie-Breaker Rule:** When the locant set is a tie, we number the ring in the direction that gives the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nLet's list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n1.  **cyano**\n2.  **dimethylamino**\n3.  **formyl** (the name for -CHO when it's a substituent)\n4.  **hydroxy**\n5.  **methoxy**\n\nThe first group alphabetically is **cyano**. Therefore, we must number the ring to give the cyano group the lowest possible number (either 3 or 5). The correct numbering must assign the **C3** position to the cyano group.\n\nWith this rule, the structure is now uniquely determined:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C3:** -CN (to satisfy the numbering rule)\n*   **C2:** -OH (must be ortho to C3 based on the \"key constraint\")\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (para to C1)\n*   **C5:** -CHO (the other meta group)\n*   **C6:** -N(CH3)2 (the other ortho group)\n\nLet's verify this final structure against all statements:\n*   -COOH, -CHO (C5), -CN (C3) are all meta to one another. (Correct)\n*   -OH (C2) and -N(CH3)2 (C6) are ortho to -COOH. (Correct)\n*   -OCH3 (C4) is para to -COOH. (Correct)\n*   -OCH3 (C4) and -OH (C2) are both ortho to -CN (C3). (Correct)\n\nThe structure is confirmed.\n\n**4. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name**\n\nNow, we list the substituents (in alphabetical order) with their determined locants, followed by the parent name.\n\n*   cyano -> 3-cyano\n*   dimethylamino -> 6-(dimethylamino)\n*   formyl -> 5-formyl\n*   hydroxy -> 2-hydroxy\n*   methoxy -> 4-methoxy\n\nCombining these in alphabetical order gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n*   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid\n\nOur derived name is a perfect match for option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
