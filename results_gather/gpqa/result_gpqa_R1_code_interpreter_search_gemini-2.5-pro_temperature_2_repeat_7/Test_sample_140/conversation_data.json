    "This problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This set of reagents and reactants points to a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction that proceeds via a benzyne intermediate through an elimination-addition mechanism.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction pathways:\n\n**Step 1: Elimination to form Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) is a strong base that abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the bromine is at position C1. The two ortho positions are C2 and C6.\n\n*   Position C2 is substituted with deuterium (d).\n*   Position C6 is substituted with hydrogen (H).\n\nThe C-H bond is slightly weaker than the C-D bond. Due to this kinetic isotope effect, abstraction of the proton from C6 is faster and thus the major pathway. However, the abstraction of the deuteron from C2 is also possible and represents a minor pathway. Therefore, two different benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n**Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6**\n1.  The amide ion abstracts the proton from C6.\n2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 leads to the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at C2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n**Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2**\n1.  The amide ion abstracts the deuteron from C2.\n2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 leads to the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Addition of Nucleophile to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbon atoms of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n**Products from Pathway A (via 3-deuterobenzyne)**\n\nThe nucleophile NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C6 of the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate.\n\n1.  **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH2) adds to C1. A carbanion is formed at C6, which is then protonated by ammonia. The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium atom at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n2.  **Attack at C6:** The amino group adds to C6. A carbanion is formed at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium atom at C2. When numbering the aniline product, the -NH2 group is at position 1, making this **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\nSo, the major pathway (A) leads to two distinct products: 2-deuteroaniline and 3-deuteroaniline.\n\n**Products from Pathway B (via benzyne)**\n\nThe nucleophile NH2⁻ attacks the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate at either C1 or C2.\n\n1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group adds to C1. The carbanion at C2 is protonated. The product is **aniline**.\n2.  **Attack at C2:** The -NH2 group adds to C2. The carbanion at C1 is protonated. The product is also **aniline**.\n\nSo, the minor pathway (B) leads to only one product: aniline.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from both possible pathways, we have three unique organic products that can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<D>>>"
