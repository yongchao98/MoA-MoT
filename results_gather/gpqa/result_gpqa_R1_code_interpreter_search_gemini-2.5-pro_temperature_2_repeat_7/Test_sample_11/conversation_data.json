    "This is a particle decay problem that can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### 1. Identify the Decay Process and Initial Conditions:\nThe decay is: Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu\nThe initial particle, the positive pion (Pi+), is stationary. This means its initial momentum is zero.\n\n### 2. Apply Conservation Laws:\n**a) Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum of the product particles must also be zero. This means the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu) must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n`p_mu = p_nu = p`\n\n**b) Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n`E_initial = E_final`\n\n*   **Initial Energy:** The pion is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest energy.\n    `E_initial = m_pi * c^2`\n*   **Final Energy:** The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`\n\nThe total energy of a particle is given by `E = KE + m*c^2`, where KE is the kinetic energy and `m*c^2` is the rest energy.\n\nSo, the energy conservation equation is:\n`m_pi * c^2 = (KE_mu + m_mu * c^2) + (KE_nu + m_nu * c^2)`\n\n### 3. Simplify Using Relativistic Relations and Assumptions:\n*   **Neutrino Mass:** In most standard model problems, the neutrino's mass is considered to be zero or negligible (`m_nu ≈ 0`). This simplifies the equations significantly. For a massless particle, its total energy is purely kinetic and is related to its momentum by `E_nu = KE_nu = p_nu * c = p * c`.\n\n*   **Muon Energy-Momentum:** For the massive muon, the relativistic energy-momentum relation is `(E_mu)^2 = (p_mu * c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`.\nSince `p_mu = p` and `E_mu = KE_mu + m_mu * c^2`, we have:\n`(KE_mu + m_mu * c^2)^2 = (p * c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\n### 4. Solve the System of Equations:\nWe have the following system:\n1.  Energy Conservation: `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n2.  Momentum relation: `E_nu = p * c`\n3.  Muon energy-momentum: `E_mu^2 = (p * c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nFrom (1), we can write `E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - E_nu`.\nSubstitute this and (2) into (3):\n`(m_pi * c^2 - E_nu)^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nExpand the left side:\n`(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*E_nu + E_nu^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\nThe `E_nu^2` terms cancel out. Now, we solve for `E_nu` (which is `KE_nu`):\n`(m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 = 2*(m_pi*c^2)*E_nu`\n`KE_nu = E_nu = [(m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2] / [2 * (m_pi*c^2)]`\n\nOnce `KE_nu` is found, we can find `KE_mu` from the conservation of energy. The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest mass energy:\n`Total KE = KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi*c^2 - m_mu*c^2`\n`KE_mu = (m_pi*c^2 - m_mu*c^2) - KE_nu`\n\n### 5. Calculation\nLet's use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately with the given values.\n*   Rest energy of Pi(+) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest energy of mu(+) = 105.7 MeV\n\n```python\n# Rest energies are given in MeV.\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu) using the derived formula.\n# For a massless neutrino, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\nKE_nu = ((m_pi_c2**2) - (m_mu_c2**2)) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu).\n# The total kinetic energy released is the difference in rest masses (since m_nu = 0).\ntotal_KE = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\nKE_mu = total_KE - KE_nu\n\n# The question asks for the KE of the product particles, which are the muon and the neutrino.\n# The options appear to list the muon's KE first, then the neutrino's KE.\nprint(f\"KE of mu(+) = {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of nu = {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n\n```\n>>>\nKE of mu(+) = 4.12 MeV\nKE of nu = 29.78 MeV\n<<<\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (mu+) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (nu), after rounding the neutrino's energy. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu) is given by:\n`Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n\nTo solve this, we will use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**Given values:**\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+) (`m_pi * c^2`): 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass of mu(+) (`m_mu * c^2`): 105.7 MeV\n*   The rest mass of a neutrino (`m_nu * c^2`) is considered to be 0 for this problem.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the initial Pi(+) is stationary, its momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the product particles must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n`p_mu = p_nu = p`\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay equals the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Initial Energy (`E_initial`):** The Pi(+) is at rest, so its energy is purely its rest mass energy.\n    `E_initial = m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n*   **Final Energy (`E_final`):** This is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`\n\nThe total energy `E` of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy (`KE`) and its rest mass energy (`m*c^2`).\nSo, the energy conservation equation is:\n`m_pi * c^2 = (KE_mu + m_mu * c^2) + E_nu`\n\n**Relating Energy and Momentum:**\n*   For the **massless neutrino**, its total energy is purely kinetic and is related to its momentum by `E_nu = KE_nu = p * c`.\n*   For the **massive muon**, the relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E_mu^2 = (p * c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`.\n\n**Solving for the Energies:**\nWe can substitute `p * c = E_nu` into the muon's energy-momentum equation:\n`E_mu^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nFrom the energy conservation equation, we can express `E_mu` as:\n`E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - E_nu`\n\nNow, substitute this expression for `E_mu` back into the rearranged energy-momentum equation:\n`(m_pi * c^2 - E_nu)^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nExpand the left side:\n`(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_pi*c^2) * E_nu + E_nu^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\nThe `E_nu^2` terms cancel out. We can now solve for `E_nu`, which is the kinetic energy of the neutrino (`KE_nu`):\n`(m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 = 2 * (m_pi*c^2) * E_nu`\n`KE_nu = E_nu = [(m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2] / [2 * (m_pi*c^2)]`\n\nLet's plug in the numbers:\n`KE_nu = [(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2] / [2 * 139.6]`\n`KE_nu = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / [279.2]`\n`KE_nu = 8315.67 / 279.2`\n`KE_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\nNow we can find the kinetic energy of the muon (`KE_mu`). The total kinetic energy released is the difference between the initial and final rest energies:\n`KE_total = KE_mu + KE_nu = (m_pi*c^2) - (m_mu*c^2 + m_nu*c^2)`\n`KE_total = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV`\n\nTherefore, `KE_mu` is:\n`KE_mu = KE_total - KE_nu`\n`KE_mu = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV`\n`KE_mu = 4.1 MeV`\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. The option `4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV` is the closest match to our detailed calculation. The slight difference is due to rounding during the steps. The code output provided the more precise values of `KE_mu = 4.12 MeV` and `KE_nu = 29.78 MeV`.\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are:\n*   KE of mu(+) ≈ 4.12 MeV\n*   KE of nu ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
