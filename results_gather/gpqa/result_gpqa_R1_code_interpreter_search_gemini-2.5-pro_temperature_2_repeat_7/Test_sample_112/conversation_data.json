    "Here is my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Provided Information:**\n    I need to identify the correct molecular formula from four options by interpreting data from three different spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry.\n\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n        *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding, which is particularly strong in carboxylic acids. It can also be seen in alcohols, but it's typically much broader for carboxylic acids.\n        *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A carboxylic acid C=O stretch is typically found around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n        *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is typically associated with a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbon atoms of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene functional group, which was suggested by the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak in the FTIR.\n\n    *   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n        *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. I need to determine what chemical fragment has a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. The most common and stable fragment with this mass is the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n            *   Calculation: Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 2 * 16 + 1 = 45 amu. This fragment is a very common result of alpha-cleavage in carboxylic acids.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Findings from the Spectra:**\n    *   The combination of a broad O-H stretch (FTIR), a C=O stretch (FTIR), and a mass spec fragment at m/z 45 provides overwhelming evidence for the presence of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH) functional group.\n    *   The combination of a C=C stretch (FTIR) and the presence of vinyl-hydrogens (¹H NMR) confirms the presence of an **alkene** (C=C) functional group.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:**\n    Now I will use the information about the functional groups to select the correct molecular formula.\n\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options C (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O), as they only contain one oxygen atom. I am now left with options A (C₆H₁₂O₂) and B (C₆H₁₀O₂).\n\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is a count of the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is: `DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1` (where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, N is nitrogens; for formulas with oxygen, it's just `DoU = C - H/2 + 1`).\n        *   Our identified functional groups tell us what the DoU must be. We have one C=O double bond (in the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (in the alkene). Each double bond corresponds to one degree of unsaturation.\n        *   Therefore, the correct molecule must have a **DoU = 2**.\n\n    *   **Calculate DoU for the remaining options:** I'll use a python script to perform this calculation accurately for the two remaining formulas.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a molecular formula of the form CxHyOz.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n    counts = {element: int(count) if count else 1 for element, count in parts}\n    \n    C = counts.get('C', 0)\n    H = counts.get('H', 0)\n    \n    # Formula: DoU = C - H/2 + 1\n    dou = C - (H / 2) + 1\n    return int(dou)\n\n# Candidate formulas\nformula_A = \"C6H12O2\"\nformula_B = \"C6H10O2\"\n\n# Calculate DoU\ndou_A = calculate_dou(formula_A)\ndou_B = calculate_dou(formula_B)\n\nprint(f\"Degree of Unsaturation for {formula_A}: {dou_A}\")\nprint(f\"Degree of Unsaturation for {formula_B}: {dou_B}\")\n```\n<execute_output>\nDegree of Unsaturation for C6H12O2: 1\nDegree of Unsaturation for C6H10O2: 2\n</execute_output>\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The spectroscopic data requires the molecule to have a Degree of Unsaturation of 2 (one for C=O, one for C=C).\n    *   The calculation shows that **C₆H₁₂O₂** (Option A) has a DoU of **1**. This is not consistent with the presence of both an alkene and a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The calculation shows that **C₆H₁₀O₂** (Option B) has a DoU of **2**. This is perfectly consistent with the presence of an alkene and a carboxylic acid.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the experimental evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding, which is particularly strong in carboxylic acids (-COOH). It could also be an alcohol (-OH), but the other peaks will help clarify.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid appears around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This, combined with the broad O-H stretch, strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This information confirms the presence of an alkene group, supporting the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of information. We need to identify a common, stable fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. The most likely candidate is the carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Let's calculate its mass: Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + (2 * 16) + 1 = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45.\n    *   The presence of a fragment at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   From FTIR and Mass Spectrometry, we have strong evidence for a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH).\n    *   From FTIR and ¹H NMR, we have confirmed the presence of an **alkene** group (C=C).\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:**\n    *   A carboxylic acid group contains **two** oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options C) C₆H₁₂O and D) C₆H₁₀O, as they only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with A) C₆H₁₂O₂ and B) C₆H₁₀O₂.\n    *   Now, we must use the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to differentiate between them. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in the molecule. Our analysis indicates the molecule must contain at least two double bonds: one C=O from the acid and one C=C from the alkene. This means the molecule must have a DoU of at least 2.\n    *   The formula for Degree of Unsaturation is: DoU = C - H/2 + 1 (where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens).\n    *   Let's check the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12 / 2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1.\n        *   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10 / 2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The experimental data requires a molecule with a Degree of Unsaturation of 2 (one for the C=O and one for the C=C). Only the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** has a DoU of 2. Therefore, this is the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
