    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Moles**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases is produced and passed through a series of tubes. We can identify the components of the gas mixture from the effects on these tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The mass of this tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO): 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, limewater, or hot copper. The most common unreactive gas produced from the decomposition of salts is nitrogen (N₂). Let's assume Gas C is N₂ and verify this with a mass balance check.\n\n**2. Verify Mass Conservation and Determine Elemental Composition**\n\nThe initial mass of the salt mixture was 7.20 g. By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the gaseous products must also be 7.20 g.\n\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ (assuming C is N₂) = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.1 mol × 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly. Our identification of the products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) and their quantities is correct. Now we can determine the total moles of each element in the original salts.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × n(H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Moles of N = 2 × n(N₂) = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in both H₂O and O₂. Moles of O = (1 × n(H₂O)) + (2 × n(O₂)) = (1 × 0.2) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nSo, the original 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B contained 0.4 mol of H, 0.2 mol of N, and 0.25 mol of O.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe are told the mixture is equimolar, meaning n(A) = n(B). Let's call this number of moles 'x'.\nThe elements present (H, N, O) and the fact that they are salts suggest they could be ammonium salts of oxygen-containing anions. Let's assume both salts contain the ammonium cation (NH₄⁺).\n\n*   Salt A = NH₄⁺X⁻\n*   Salt B = NH₄⁺Y⁻\n\nTotal moles of H atoms in the mixture = (moles of NH₄⁺ in A) × 4 + (moles of NH₄⁺ in B) × 4 = (x × 4) + (x × 4) = 8x.\nFrom our product analysis, we know the total moles of H is 0.4.\n*   8x = 0.4 mol  =>  x = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, we have 0.05 mol of salt A and 0.05 mol of salt B. Now let's determine the composition of the anions X and Y.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):**\n    *   Total N required = 0.2 mol.\n    *   N from the NH₄⁺ cations = (moles of NH₄⁺ in A) + (moles of NH₄⁺ in B) = x + x = 2x = 2(0.05) = 0.1 mol.\n    *   The remaining N must come from the anions: N(anions) = 0.2 - 0.1 = 0.1 mol.\n    *   Let Nₓ and Nᵧ be the number of N atoms per anion in X and Y. Then: (0.05 × Nₓ) + (0.05 × Nᵧ) = 0.1 => Nₓ + Nᵧ = 2.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):**\n    *   Total O required = 0.25 mol.\n    *   The NH₄⁺ cation contains no oxygen. All oxygen comes from the anions.\n    *   Let Oₓ and Oᵧ be the number of O atoms per anion in X and Y. Then: (0.05 × Oₓ) + (0.05 × Oᵧ) = 0.25 => Oₓ + Oᵧ = 5.\n\nWe need to find two common nitrogen-oxygen anions, X and Y, such that the total number of nitrogen atoms is 2 and the total number of oxygen atoms is 5.\nLet's consider the common anions nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n\n*   For NO₂⁻: N=1, O=2\n*   For NO₃⁻: N=1, O=3\n\nIf we set X = NO₂⁻ and Y = NO₃⁻:\n*   Total N atoms = N(NO₂⁻) + N(NO₃⁻) = 1 + 1 = 2. (This matches)\n*   Total O atoms = O(NO₂⁻) + O(NO₃⁻) = 2 + 3 = 5. (This also matches)\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: NH₄NO₂ (Ammonium nitrite)**\n*   **Salt B: NH₄NO₃ (Ammonium nitrate)**\n\nLet's do a final check with the total mass:\n*   M(NH₄NO₂) = 14.01×2 + 1.01×4 + 16.00×2 = 64.06 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol × 64.06 g/mol = 3.203 g.\n*   M(NH₄NO₃) = 14.01×2 + 1.01×4 + 16.00×3 = 80.06 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol × 80.06 g/mol = 4.003 g.\n*   Total Mass = 3.203 g + 4.003 g = 7.206 g. This matches the given 7.20 g.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 N in NH₄⁺ + 1 N in NO₂⁻ = 2 Nitrogen atoms\n    *   4 H in NH₄⁺ = 4 Hydrogen atoms\n    *   2 O in NO₂⁻ = 2 Oxygen atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 N in NH₄⁺ + 1 N in NO₃⁻ = 2 Nitrogen atoms\n    *   4 H in NH₄⁺ = 4 Hydrogen atoms\n    *   3 O in NO₃⁻ = 3 Oxygen atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
