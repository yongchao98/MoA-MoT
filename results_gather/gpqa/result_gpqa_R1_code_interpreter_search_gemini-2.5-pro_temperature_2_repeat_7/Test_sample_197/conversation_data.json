    "This problem requires us to calculate the percentage of a specific cobalt complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or [Co(SCN)2], out of all cobalt-containing species in a solution.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the species and reactions:**\n    Cobalt(II) ions (Co^2+) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN-) to form a series of complexes. The general reaction is:\n    Co^2+ + n SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)\n    The overall stability constant, βn, for each step is given:\n    β1 = [[Co(SCN)]+] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]) = 9\n    β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^2) = 40\n    β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^3) = 63\n    β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^4) = 16\n    The cobalt-containing species in the solution are: Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]+, [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3]-, and [Co(SCN)4]^2-.\n\n2.  **Define the fraction of each species:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]\n\n    Using the stability constants, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co^2+], and the free thiocyanate ion concentration, [SCN-]. Let L = [SCN-].\n    [[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)] = βn * [Co^2+] * L^n\n\n    Substituting these into the total cobalt concentration equation:\n    c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+]L + β2[Co^2+]L^2 + β3[Co^2+]L^3 + β4[Co^2+]L^4\n    c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1L + β2L^2 + β3L^3 + β4L^4)\n\n    The fraction (αn) of a particular species [Co(SCN)n]^(2-n) is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n    αn = [[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)] / c(Co)\n    αn = (βn * [Co^2+] * L^n) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1L + β2L^2 + β3L^3 + β4L^4))\n    αn = (βn * L^n) / (1 + β1L + β2L^2 + β3L^3 + β4L^4)\n    (Note: For the free Co^2+ ion, n=0, and β0 is defined as 1.)\n\n3.  **Identify the target species and required values:**\n    We need to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is [Co(SCN)2]. This corresponds to n=2.\n    So, we need to calculate α2.\n    Percentage of [Co(SCN)2] = α2 * 100%\n    The formula is:\n    α2 = (β2 * L^2) / (1 + β1L + β2L^2 + β3L^3 + β4L^4)\n\n4.  **Plug in the given values:**\n    The problem states that the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. In chemical equilibrium problems, the notation `[X]` refers to the equilibrium concentration of species X. Therefore, we use L = [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10^-2 M, is not needed to calculate the percentage distribution of the species, as the fraction αn depends only on the free ligand concentration.\n    Given values:\n    L = 0.1 M\n    β1 = 9\n    β2 = 40\n    β3 = 63\n    β4 = 16\n\n5.  **Calculate the percentage:**\n    Let's calculate the terms in the formula. A Python script is useful to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\n# Stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Free ligand concentration [SCN-]\nL = 0.1\n\n# The term for the species of interest [Co(SCN)2] in the numerator\nnumerator_term = beta2 * L**2\n\n# The sum of all terms in the denominator (the degree of formation function, Phi)\ndenominator_sum = 1 + beta1*L + beta2*L**2 + beta3*L**3 + beta4*L**4\n\n# Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (alpha2)\nalpha2 = numerator_term / denominator_sum\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage=}\")\n```\n>>>\npercentage=16.916180326482276\n>>>\n\nThe calculation shows that the fraction α2 is approximately 0.16916, which corresponds to 16.916%. This value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
