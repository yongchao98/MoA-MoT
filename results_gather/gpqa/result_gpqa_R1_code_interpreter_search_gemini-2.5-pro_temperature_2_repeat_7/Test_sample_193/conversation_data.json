    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and its States:**\n    The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take one of two values: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n    The total number of possible states (configurations) of the system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 2^3 = 8.\n\n2.  **Define the Energy of the System:**\n    The energy for any given state is defined by the Hamiltonian:\n    E = -J[ S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 ]\n    where J is a constant.\n\n3.  **Define the Partition Function:**\n    The partition function, Z, is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible states of the system.\n    Z = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n    where β = 1/(kT).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy for Each State:**\n    We need to calculate the energy for all 8 possible states. A more efficient way is to group the states by their configuration type, as states with the same number of up/down spins will have the same energy due to the symmetry of the Hamiltonian.\n\n    *   **Case 1: All spins are the same.**\n        *   State A: (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n            The energy is E_A = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J.\n        *   State B: (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n            The energy is E_B = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J.\n        So, we have an energy level E1 = -3J. The number of states with this energy (degeneracy) is g1 = 2.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Two spins are up (+1) and one is down (-1).**\n        There are three such states: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), and (-1, +1, +1).\n        Let's calculate the energy for one of them, e.g., (+1, +1, -1):\n        E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = J.\n        Due to symmetry, all three of these states will have the same energy.\n        So, this contributes 3 states to an energy level.\n\n    *   **Case 3: One spin is up (+1) and two are down (-1).**\n        There are three such states: (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n        Let's calculate the energy for one of them, e.g., (+1, -1, -1):\n        E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = -J(-1) = J.\n        Again, due to symmetry, all three of these states will have the same energy.\n        So, this also contributes 3 states to an energy level.\n\n    *   **Summarize Energy Levels and Degeneracies:**\n        *   Energy Level E1 = -3J has a degeneracy g1 = 2.\n        *   Energy Level E2 = J has a degeneracy g2 = 3 (from Case 2) + 3 (from Case 3) = 6.\n\n    *   **Verification:** The total number of states is g1 + g2 = 2 + 6 = 8, which is the correct total number of states for the system.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Partition Function Z:**\n    The partition function is the sum of contributions from each energy level, weighted by their degeneracy:\n    Z = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\n    Substituting the values we found:\n    Z = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (J))\n    Z = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated partition function is Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ).\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n    B) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n    C) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n    D) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n\n    Our result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
