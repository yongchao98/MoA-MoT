    "*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for what should be a single alpha-proton. The integrals are roughly equal and sum to one proton equivalent. This indicates the presence of two species in a roughly 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, the two alpha-protons must be in slightly different chemical environments. This happens when two stereoisomers are present that are not enantiomers. Enantiomers are chemically identical in an achiral environment (like a standard NMR solvent) and would give a single peak. Diastereomers, however, are chemically distinct and will have different NMR spectra, often with slight shifts for corresponding protons.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The Liquid Chromatography (LC) step separates molecules based on their physical properties (like polarity, which affects their interaction with the stationary phase). The fact that there are two separate peaks indicates there are two different compounds that can be separated by LC. The Mass Spectrometry (MS) step measures the mass-to-charge ratio. The data shows that both separated peaks have the exact same mass spectrum, which corresponds to the expected product. This means the two compounds are isomers—they have the same chemical formula but different arrangements of atoms.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical properties and can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography (LC). They also have different NMR spectra. This perfectly aligns with seeing two peaks in the LC and two corresponding peaks in the NMR, all while having the same mass. This is a very likely explanation, possibly caused by racemization of one of the amino acid chiral centers during the synthesis.\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would result in a product with a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass. The MS data contradicts this, as both peaks have the mass of the expected product.\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis would have a different chemical structure and, almost certainly, a different mass. Again, the MS data rules this out.\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In an achiral environment, they have identical physical and spectroscopic properties. Therefore, they would not be separated on a standard LC column and would not show two different peaks in a standard NMR spectrum. They would appear as a single substance. This explanation contradicts both the LC and NMR data.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The evidence strongly points to the presence of a pair of diastereomers. They have the same mass (same MS), but are distinct enough in their 3D structure to have different physical properties (separable by LC) and different NMR spectra. The fact that the LC peaks are resolved at *elevated temperature* also suggests they are stable isomers, not rapidly interconverting conformers (rotamers), which would tend to coalesce at higher temperatures.\n\n<<<A>>>"
