    "Here's a detailed thinking process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure and substituent positions:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position C1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position C2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C3.\n\nThe relative positions of the substituents are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern is sterically hindered and requires a careful synthetic strategy to control the regiochemistry.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of the groups is crucial for planning the synthesis using electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Activating, *ortho, para*-director. Due to its large size, it strongly favors *para* substitution over *ortho*.\n*   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Amino (-NH2):** (Intermediate) Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. In strong acid, it forms the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Hydroxyl (-OH):** (Intermediate) Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Sulfonic Acid (-SO3H):** (Intermediate/Blocking Group) Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director. It can be removed (desulfonation) with dilute acid.\n\n**3. Evaluate Plausible Synthetic Endgames**\n\nLet's consider how the final group might be added.\n*   **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The ethoxy group is almost certainly added at the end by reacting the corresponding phenol (2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol) with an ethyl halide (e.g., NaOH/EtBr). This is a robust and common reaction. This means we should aim to synthesize **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   **Nitration as the final step:** Nitrating 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxybenzene. Both -OEt and -tBu are *ortho, para* directors. They would direct the incoming nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not the desired position 3. So, nitration cannot be the final step.\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation as a late step:** Tert-butylating 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The activating -OEt group would direct the incoming -tBu group to positions 2, 4, and 6. Position 2 gives the correct product. This is plausible, but Friedel-Crafts reactions on moderately deactivated rings can be sluggish.\n\nThe most likely penultimate molecule is the phenol. Our goal is to find a high-yield synthesis for **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nNow, let's analyze the given reaction sequences. A \"high-yield\" synthesis implies that regioselectivity is well-controlled at each step. This often involves using blocking groups.\n\n*   **Option B and C:** Option B starts by making 4-tert-butylaniline, which has a 1,4-substitution pattern, incorrect for our 1,2,3-target. Option C has a typographical error in the sequence (\"HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii)\"), making it difficult to follow. Both are unlikely.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    *   i) `Benzene --(tBuCl/AlCl3)-->` **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Standard FC-alkylation).\n    *   ii) `tert-Butylbenzene --(SO3/H2SO4)-->` **4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is an excellent strategic move. The bulky t-Bu group directs sulfonation to the *para* position, which is now \"blocked\".\n    *   iii) `4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid --(HNO3/H2SO4)-->` **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. Both the -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) groups direct nitration to the positions *ortho* to the t-butyl group (C2 and C6). This is a classic use of a blocking group to achieve high-yield ortho substitution, which is otherwise difficult. This gives us the crucial `tBu-ortho-NO2` relationship.\n    *   So far, this is a superb, high-yield strategy. Let's look at the remaining steps.\n    *   iv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduces the -NO2 group to -NH2. -> 4-tert-butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Converts the -NH2 group into a diazonium salt, -N2+.\n    *   vi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: This step is chemically incorrect as written. One does not perform nitration on a highly deactivated diazonium salt with `HNO3/H2SO4`. Also, replacing the diazonium group with -NO2 requires different reagents (a Sandmeyer-type reaction, e.g., NaNO2/Cu). The sequence of steps from (iv) onwards is nonsensical and would not lead to the target product. Therefore, option D is incorrect due to a flawed sequence.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    *   i) `Benzene --(tBuCl/AlCl3)-->` **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n    *   ii) `tert-Butylbenzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)-->` **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** + **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. The desired ortho isomer is the *minor* product; the para isomer is major due to sterics. This is a significant blow to the \"high-yield\" claim. However, let's assume we can isolate the ortho isomer and proceed.\n    *   iii) `o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene --(Fe/HCl)-->` **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Standard nitro reduction).\n    *   iv) `2-tert-butylaniline --(HNO3/H2SO4)-->` ? Nitration of an aniline in strong acid first protonates the amine to the anilinium ion (-NH3+). For 2-tert-butylanilinium, the -NH3+ at C1 is a *meta*-director (directs to C3, C5), and the -tBu at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director (directs to C4, C6). Substitution at C3 gives the needed **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. While a mixture of isomers is expected, formation of the 3-nitro product is chemically plausible.\n    *   v) `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline --(NaNO2/HCl)-->` Diazotization to the corresponding diazonium salt. This is a standard reaction.\n    *   vi) `Diazonium salt --(H3O+, H2O/Heat)-->` **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. This is also a standard reaction. We have now synthesized our key precursor.\n    *   vii) `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol --(NaOH/EtBr)-->` **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Standard Williamson ether synthesis to yield the final product.\n    *   viii) `SO3/H2SO4` & ix) `dilute H2SO4`: These last two steps are superfluous and make no chemical sense following the successful synthesis in step vii. They appear to be an error in the question's construction.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\n*   Options B and C are incorrect due to leading to the wrong isomers or being chemically incoherent.\n*   Option D starts with an excellent strategy (blocking group) but its subsequent steps are chemically flawed and illogical as written.\n*   Option A describes a chemically plausible sequence (steps i-vii) that successfully produces the target molecule. Its primary weaknesses are a likely low-yield step at the beginning (ii) and two inexplicable, extraneous steps at the end (viii, ix).\n\nDespite its flaws, Option A is the only choice that presents a complete, step-by-step pathway from starting material to final product that is chemically possible, even if not optimal in terms of yield. The flaws in the other options are more fundamental (wrong isomers or nonsensical reactions). Therefore, Option A is the most plausible intended answer, assuming errors in the question's construction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
