    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Product Structure\n\nBoth reactions produce an enantiomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**.\n*   **\"pyran\"**: Indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **\"tetrahydro...-2-one\"**: This specifies a saturated six-membered ring with a carbonyl group at position 2, adjacent to the ring oxygen (position 1). This is a δ-lactone (delta-lactone).\n*   **\"4-ethyl\"**: An ethyl group is attached to carbon 4 of the lactone ring.\n*   The structure is chiral, with the stereocenter at carbon 4.\n\nThe structure of the lactone ring is:\n`O(1)-C(2)(=O)-C(3)H2-C(4)H(Et)-C(5)H2-C(6)H2-`\n\nA lactone is a cyclic ester, typically formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxy carboxylic acid. To form this specific six-membered lactone, the precursor must be a **5-hydroxy acid**. Hydrolysis (breaking the ester bond) of the product gives its hydroxy acid precursor:\n`HO-C(6)H2-C(5)H2-C(4)H(Et)-C(3)H2-C(2)(=O)-OH`\nIf we renumber this as a standard carboxylic acid chain (starting from the -COOH group), it is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2OH(5)`\nThe stereocenter in this hydroxy acid is C3. Lactonization does not affect this stereocenter. Therefore, the stereochemistry at C4 of the lactone product directly corresponds to the stereochemistry at C3 of its hydroxy acid precursor.\n*   `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` will produce `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   `(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` will produce `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents\n\nThe options propose that the starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Let's interpret this chemical name. It describes a derivative of `pentanoic acid` (a 5-carbon carboxylic acid). The `5-oxo` and `5-isobutoxy` substituents describe an isobutyl ester group (`-C(=O)O-isobutyl`) at the end of the chain.\n*   The structure is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n*   Let's draw the structure, with C1 being the carboxylic acid carbon:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(5)(=O)-O-isobutyl`\n*   This molecule is chiral at C3 because the two groups attached to it (`-CH2COOH` and `-CH2COOiBu`) are different.\n\nNow, let's analyze how the given reducing agents react with this starting material.\n\n**Reaction A: Treatment with LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**\n*   `LiBH₄` is a reducing agent that is effective at reducing esters, aldehydes, and ketones. It is much less reactive towards carboxylates (the deprotonated form of carboxylic acids). Therefore, in a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, `LiBH₄` will selectively reduce the **ester** group.\n*   **Reaction:** `LiBH₄` reduces the isobutyl ester at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n*   **Intermediate:** `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2OH(5)`. This is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n*   **Final Step:** The acidic workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the intermediate to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction occurs at C5 (the ester) which is not the stereocenter. The stereocenter at C3 is unaffected. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is the same as the starting material.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction A:**\n    *   Starting Material `A` reacts with `LiBH₄` to produce `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   This implies that `A` must be the **(R)-enantiomer** of the starting material.\n    *   `A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**Reaction B: Treatment with BH₃ (Borane)**\n*   `BH₃` is a reducing agent that has a strong and well-known selectivity for reducing **carboxylic acids** in the presence of esters.\n*   **Reaction:** `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n*   **Intermediate:** `HOCH₂(from C1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(5)(=O)-O-isobutyl`. This is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n*   **Final Step:** The acidic workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed alcohol group attacks the ester carbonyl group, displacing isobutanol and forming the cyclic lactone. Let's trace the ring formation: the oxygen from the original C1 attacks the carbonyl carbon C5. This forms a ring containing O(from C1), C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 - a six-membered ring.\n*   **Resulting Lactone Structure:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the same structural skeleton as in Reaction A.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction occurs at C1 (the acid) which is not the stereocenter. The stereocenter at C3 is unaffected. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is the same as the starting material.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction B:**\n    *   Starting Material `B` reacts with `BH₃` to produce `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   This implies that `B` must be the **(S)-enantiomer** of the starting material.\n    *   `B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
