    "Here's a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown white solid.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes. We'll assume this corresponds to the molecule containing the most common isotope of chlorine, ³⁵Cl.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion peak. The relative abundance of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) gives a ratio of approximately 3:1. This is the characteristic isotopic signature for a compound containing a single chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes: ³⁵Cl ≈ 75.8% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular formulas of the options. All proposed structures (2-chlorobenzoic acid, phenyl chloroformate, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and 4-chlorobenzoic acid) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Molecular Weight = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35.5) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5 g/mol. This is consistent with the mass spectrum data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic and very strong indicator of an O-H bond stretch within a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, it aligns perfectly with the carbonyl group in a conjugated carboxylic acid (Ar-COOH).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of both of these peaks strongly suggests the molecule is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate option (B) Phenyl chloroformate (an acid chloride) and (C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde with a phenol group). We are left with options (A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid and (D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A chemical shift greater than 10 ppm is characteristic of a highly deshielded proton, which is typical for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). The integration (1H) confirms it is one proton, and its singlet nature (s) is expected as it has no adjacent protons to couple with. This further confirms our conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The signals at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm are in the aromatic region. The splitting pattern is key.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (or *para*-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of a *para*-substituted ring results in only two unique types of aromatic protons.\n        *   The two protons next to one substituent are chemically equivalent.\n        *   The two protons next to the other substituent are also chemically equivalent.\n        *   Each set of protons is split into a doublet by its single adjacent proton neighbor.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The spectrum indicates a *para*-substituted benzene ring attached to a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nLet's compare the remaining options with the NMR data:\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted ring. It has no symmetry plane passing through the bonds, so all four aromatic protons would be chemically different, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (not two simple doublets).\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted ring. This structure has the required symmetry to produce two doublets, each for 2H, in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum. The electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would cause the adjacent ortho protons to appear more downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine would be slightly less deshielded (7.72 ppm).\n\nAll pieces of evidence (MS, IR, and ¹H NMR) point conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
