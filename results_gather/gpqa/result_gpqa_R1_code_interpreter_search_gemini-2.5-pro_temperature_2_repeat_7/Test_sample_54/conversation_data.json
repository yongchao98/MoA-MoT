    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Signals**\n\n*   The provided 1H NMR data shows four distinct signals.\n*   The integration values for these signals are 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms (protons) in the molecule is the sum of these integrations: 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons.\n\nNow, let's determine the total number of protons for each of the possible compounds:\n*   **Propenyl acetate (Cis or Trans):** The molecular formula is C5H8O2. This corresponds to 8 hydrogen atoms. This is consistent with the NMR data.\n    *   Structure: CH3-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3\n    *   Protons: 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8H.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (Cis or Trans):** The molecular formula is C6H10O2. This corresponds to 10 hydrogen atoms. This is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n    *   Structure: CH3-CH2-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3\n    *   Protons: 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 10H.\n\nSince the total proton count from the NMR data is 8, we can confidently **eliminate Cis-butenyl acetate (D) and Trans-butenyl acetate (C)**. The compound must be either Cis- or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Chemical Shifts and Splitting Patterns**\n\nLet's analyze the remaining two options, Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate, and match the signals to the protons in the structure: CH3(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-CO-CH3(d).\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   This is a singlet (s), meaning it has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   It integrates to 3 protons, suggesting a methyl (CH3) group.\n    *   A chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (-O-CO-**CH3**). This corresponds to **CH3(d)**. This signal is expected for both cis and trans isomers.\n\n*   **Signals for the Propenyl Group (CH3(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-):** We have three remaining signals: 7.0 ppm (1H, d), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), and 1.6 ppm (3H, d).\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is a doublet (d) integrating to 3H. This is characteristic of a methyl group (**CH3(a)**) that is coupled to a single adjacent proton (CH(b)). The splitting into a doublet confirms this coupling.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a vinyl proton (a proton on a C=C double bond). The high chemical shift (downfield) is due to its attachment to the deshielding oxygen atom of the ester group. This signal corresponds to proton **H(c)**. It is split into a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the other vinyl proton, H(b).\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal corresponds to the remaining vinyl proton, **H(b)**. It is split by two different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   It is coupled to the single proton H(c), splitting the signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   It is also coupled to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group CH3(a), which splits the signal further into a **quartet (q)**.\n        *   The combined splitting pattern is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n\nThe assignment of all signals, their integrations, and their splitting patterns is fully consistent with the structure of propenyl acetate.\n\n**3. Use the Coupling Constant (J) to Determine Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe final and most crucial piece of evidence is the coupling constant (J-value) of the signal at 7.0 ppm, which is **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value represents the coupling between the two vinyl protons, H(b) and H(c).\n\nThe magnitude of the coupling constant between vicinal protons on a double bond is highly dependent on their stereochemical relationship:\n*   **Trans-coupling (³J_trans):** Protons are on opposite sides of the double bond. The coupling constant is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n*   **Cis-coupling (³J_cis):** Protons are on the same side of the double bond. The coupling constant is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration. This indicates that the two vinyl protons are on opposite sides of the double bond.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the total proton count, the chemical shifts, the splitting patterns, and particularly the large vicinal coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz), the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
