    "Here's a breakdown of why each theory does or does not require regularization at high energies:\n\n1.  **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**: This is the quantum theory of light and matter interaction. When calculating physical quantities in QED, especially those involving virtual particle loops (like the self-energy of an electron), one encounters mathematical integrals that diverge, meaning they go to infinity. These are called ultraviolet (UV) divergences and occur at high energy/short distance scales. To make sense of the theory and extract finite, physical predictions, a procedure called **regularization** is employed to temporarily tame these infinities, followed by **renormalization** to absorb them into physical constants. So, QED *requires* regularization.\n\n2.  **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**: This is the theory of the strong nuclear force, which governs quarks and gluons. Like QED, QCD is a quantum field theory. It also suffers from UV divergences in loop calculations and therefore *requires* regularization and renormalization to produce meaningful physical predictions.\n\n3.  **Classical Electrodynamics**: This theory, described by Maxwell's equations, is not a quantum theory. However, it has its own problem with infinities at high energies/short distances. If you model the electron as a true point particle, the energy stored in its own electric field (its \"self-energy\") becomes infinite. To get a finite value, one must introduce a cutoff, essentially assuming the electron has a tiny but non-zero size. This is a form of regularization. Therefore, classical electrodynamics, in its formulation with point charges, also faces issues that require a form of regularization.\n\n4.  **Superstring Theory**: A key motivation and celebrated feature of superstring theory is that it is believed to be \"UV finite.\" Unlike the other theories that model fundamental particles as zero-dimensional points, string theory models them as tiny, one-dimensional vibrating strings. The interactions between these strings are \"smeared out\" over a small region rather than occurring at a single point. This smearing smooths out the short-distance behavior that causes the divergences in the other theories. As a result, calculations that would be infinite in quantum field theory yield finite results in superstring theory without the need for an external regularization procedure.\n\nConclusion: Out of the given options, Superstring Theory is the one that is constructed to be free of high-energy (ultraviolet) divergences and thus is believed not to require regularization.\n\n<<<B>>>"
