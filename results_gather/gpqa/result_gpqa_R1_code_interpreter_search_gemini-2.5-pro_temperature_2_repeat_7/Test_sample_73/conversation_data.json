    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Nature of Radioactive Decay:** The fundamental principle governing radioactive decay is that it is a memoryless Poisson process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior.\n\n2.  **Define the Survival Probability:** The probability that an atom survives for a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    `P(survival, t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ):** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P(decay, 100 min) = 0.32`\n    *   This implies that the probability of survival for 100 minutes is:\n        `P(survival, 100 min) = 1 - P(decay, 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n    Now, we can plug this into our survival formula:\n    `0.68 = e^(-λ * 100)`\n\n    To solve for `λ`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    `ln(0.68) = -λ * 100`\n    `λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes:** The question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this is the same as asking for the probability that a brand new atom will decay within 150 minutes.\n\n    The probability of decay within 150 minutes is:\n    `P(decay, 150 min) = 1 - P(survival, 150 min)`\n    `P(decay, 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n5.  **Substitute and Calculate:** Now, we substitute the expression for `λ` that we found in step 3 into this equation:\n    `P(decay, 150 min) = 1 - e^([-ln(0.68) / 100] * 150)`\n    `P(decay, 150 min) = 1 - e^([ln(0.68)] * -1.5)`\n    `P(decay, 150 min) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^-1.5))`\n    This simplifies using the property that `e^(ln(x)) = x`:\n    `P(decay, 150 min) = 1 - 0.68^1.5`\n\n    To get the final numerical value, we can use a calculator.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# P(survival for 100 min) = 0.68\n# P(survival for t) = P(survival for 100 min)^(t/100)\n# So, P(survival for 150 min) = 0.68^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5\n\n# P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - P(survival for 150 min)\nprob_decay_150 = 1 - (0.68 ** 1.5)\n\n# Convert to percentage\nprob_percentage = prob_decay_150 * 100\n\nprint(prob_percentage)\n```\n\nThe calculation `1 - (0.68 ** 1.5)` gives approximately `0.439`, which is `43.9%`.\n\nRounding this to the nearest whole percentage point, we get 44%.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The reasoning and the calculation are as follows:\n\n1.  **Principle of Radioactive Decay:** Radioactive decay is a \"memoryless\" process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its future decay probability. Therefore, we can ignore the first 50 minutes and calculate the probability of a fresh atom decaying in the next 150 minutes.\n\n2.  **Determine the Decay Constant (or Survival Rate):**\n    *   Let `P_survival(t)` be the probability that the atom has *not* decayed by time `t`.\n    *   We are given that the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   Therefore, the survival probability for 100 minutes is `P_survival(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability for the New Time Interval:**\n    *   The survival probability follows an exponential law: `P_survival(t) = (P_survival(t_0))^(t/t_0)`.\n    *   We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. First, we calculate the probability of survival for 150 minutes.\n    *   Using the 100-minute survival probability as our base:\n        `P_survival(150) = (P_survival(100))^(150/100) = 0.68 ^ 1.5`\n    *   The Python code executed in the previous step calculated the value of `0.68 ^ 1.5`. Let's use the output to proceed. `P_survival(150) ≈ 0.5607`.\n\n4.  **Find the Decay Probability:**\n    *   The probability of decay within 150 minutes is `1 - P_survival(150)`.\n    *   `P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68 ^ 1.5)`\n    *   The executed code calculated `(1 - (0.68 ** 1.5)) * 100`, which gave the result `43.92576349159981`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 43.93%.\n    *   Rounding this to the nearest percentage point gives 44%.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
