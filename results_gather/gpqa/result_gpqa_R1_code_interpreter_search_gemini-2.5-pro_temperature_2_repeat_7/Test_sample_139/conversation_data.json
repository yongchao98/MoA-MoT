    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify Substance X:**\n\n    *   **\"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"**: This strongly suggests a deuterated compound, where deuterium (D or ²H), a heavier isotope of hydrogen, replaces protium (¹H). Such compounds are frequently used in chemistry, especially in organic chemistry, for studying reaction mechanisms.\n\n    *   **\"...and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"**: This points towards a common pair of reagents, one being the standard and the other being its deuterated version. The most famous examples are Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), or Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). These are powerful reducing agents. So, X is likely LiAlD₄ or NaBD₄.\n\n    *   **\"...reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"**:\n        *   The reaction of metal hydrides with protic solvents like water is famously violent.\n        *   Let's analyze Gas W. We need a molecule with an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n            *   Nitrogen gas (N₂): Each ¹⁴N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. The molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons.\n            *   Deuterium gas (D₂): Each D atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n        *   The reaction involves Substance X, which is deuterated. It is highly plausible that the gas W is deuterium gas (D₂). For D₂ to be produced, the deuterium atoms must come from both the reagent (X) and the liquid (Y). If X is LiAlD₄ and it reacts with normal water (H₂O), the gas would be HD, which has 2 protons and 1 neutron (unequal).\n        *   Therefore, the reaction must be between the deuterated reagent (X) and a deuterated liquid (Y). The most common deuterated liquid is heavy water (D₂O).\n        *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → \"products\" + 4D₂ (W)`. This reaction pathway successfully produces D₂ gas, which fits the description of W.\n\n    *   **\"...and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"**:\n        *   Let's complete our proposed reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`.\n        *   The products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD), which is soluble, and aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃. Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Thus, Al(OD)₃ is the precipitate G. This fits the clue.\n        *   Now, what happens when G is heated? `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. The substance released, B, is heavy water, D₂O.\n\n    *   **\"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**:\n        *   We identified B as heavy water (D₂O). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C, which is 273.15 + 3.82 = 276.97 K.\n        *   276.97 K is indeed \"very close to 277 K\". This serves as a strong confirmation of our hypothesis.\n\n    *   **\"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**:\n        *   X is LiAlD₄, a powerful reducing agent. Keto acids contain both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n        *   LiAlD₄ (like its analog LiAlH₄) reduces both functional groups to alcohols. For example, the reduction of pyruvic acid (CH₃-CO-COOH) would yield 1,2-propanediol (CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)). This resulting diol molecule contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms. This clue also aligns perfectly.\n\n    *   **Conclusion**: Based on the comprehensive analysis of all clues, Substance X is unequivocally identified as **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Required Value:**\n\n    *   The question asks for \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X = **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, in its isotopic form, Deuterium D).\n    *   The atomic number identifies the element: H (Z=1), Li (Z=3), Al (Z=13).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (Al).\n    *   We need to find the sum of the masses of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element in the formula LiAlD₄. We will use the mass numbers (integers) for this calculation, as is standard for such problems and implied by the integer answers.\n        *   Mass number of the Deuterium isotope (²H or D) is 2.\n        *   Mass number of the most stable isotope of Aluminum (²⁷Al) is 27.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen)**: There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D) in the formula.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum)**: There is 1 atom of Aluminum (Al) in the formula.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   **Final Calculation**: The problem asks for the sum of these two cumulative masses.\n        *   Sum = (Cumulative mass of H) + (Cumulative mass of Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n3.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The calculated value is 35.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
