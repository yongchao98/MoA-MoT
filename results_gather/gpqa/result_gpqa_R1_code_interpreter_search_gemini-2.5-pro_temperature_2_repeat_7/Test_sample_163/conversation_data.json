    "An eclipsing binary star system allows us to determine the sum of the masses of the two stars using the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2) of the stars. The fact that the systems are eclipsing implies that their orbital inclination (i) is approximately 90 degrees, so sin(i) is approximately 1.\n\nThe formula for the total mass (M = m1 + m2) of a binary system is derived from Kepler's Third Law and is given by:\n\nM = P * (K1 + K2)^3 / (2 * G)\n\nwhere:\n*   M is the total mass of the system.\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M1) to the mass of system_2 (M2).\n\nM1 / M2 = [ P1 * (K_tot_1)^3 / (2 * G) ] / [ P2 * (K_tot_2)^3 / (2 * G) ]\n\nThe constant term (2 * G) cancels out, leaving:\n\nM1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * (K_tot_1 / K_tot_2)^3\n\nLet's gather the data provided in the problem:\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   Orbital period, P1 = 2 years\n*   Velocity amplitudes, K1_1 = 10 km/s and K1_2 = 5 km/s\n*   Total velocity amplitude, K_tot_1 = K1_1 + K1_2 = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   Orbital period, P2 = 1 year\n*   Velocity amplitudes, K2_1 = 15 km/s and K2_2 = 10 km/s\n*   Total velocity amplitude, K_tot_2 = K2_1 + K2_2 = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the ratio formula. The units for period (years) and velocity (km/s) are consistent between the two systems, so their conversion factors will cancel out.\n\nM1 / M2 = (2 years / 1 year) * (15 km/s / 25 km/s)^3\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)^3\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM1 / M2 = 54 / 125\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 0.43. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) ~ 0.4\nB) ~ 0.6\nC) ~ 1.2\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
