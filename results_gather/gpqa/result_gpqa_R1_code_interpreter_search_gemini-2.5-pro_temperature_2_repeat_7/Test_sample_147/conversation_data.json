    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of fluorine in A2.**\nThe problem states that compound A2 has a fluorine content (ωF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of this binary fluoride be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element, M(Y) is its molar mass, and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 18.998 g/mol.\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nωF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for M(Y):\nM(Y) = (n * M(F) * (1 - ωF)) / ωF\nM(Y) = (n * 18.998 * (1 - 0.3196)) / 0.3196\nM(Y) ≈ n * 40.45 g/mol\n\nWe can now test integer values for n to find plausible molar masses for Y and check them against the periodic table:\n*   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol. This is close to Calcium (Ca, 40.08) or Scandium (Sc, 44.96).\n*   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Bromine (Br, 79.90) or Krypton (Kr, 83.80).\n*   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76).\n*   If n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is close to Terbium (Tb, 158.9) or Dysprosium (Dy, 162.5).\n*   If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol. This is near Mercury (Hg, 200.6), Thallium (Tl, 204.4) or Lead (Pb, 207.2).\n*   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to Plutonium (Pu, common isotopes 239-244) or Americium (Am, 243).\n\nLet's calculate the theoretical fluorine percentage for the most likely candidates:\n*   **KrF2** (n=2, Y=Kr): M(KrF2) = 83.80 + 2*18.998 = 121.8 g/mol. ωF = (38.0/121.8) = 31.2%. This is a reasonable match.\n*   **SbF3** (n=3, Y=Sb): M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3*18.998 = 178.75 g/mol. ωF = (57.0/178.75) = 31.89%. This is a very close match.\n*   **PuF6** (n=6, Y=Pu). Using Pu-244 isotope: M(PuF6) = 244 + 6*19 = 358 g/mol. ωF = (114/358) = 31.84%. Using Pu-242 isotope: M(PuF6) = 242.06 + 6*18.998 = 356.05 g/mol. ωF = (113.99/356.05) = 32.01%. This is also an extremely close match.\n\n**Step 2: Use the other chemical properties to identify Y and its fluorides.**\n\nThe problem provides several clues:\n*   A bright-red substance **A1** decomposes at room temperature (293 K) into **A2** and fluorine gas (F2).\n*   **A1** and **A3** are strong oxidizing agents that can react with xenon.\n*   **Y** forms five known binary fluorides.\n\nLet's evaluate our candidates based on these clues:\n*   **Candidate Kr**: Five fluorides of Krypton are not known (only KrF2 is well-established). Also, for A1 to decompose into A2 (KrF2) and F2, A1 must be KrF4. KrF4 is believed to be a colorless solid, not \"bright-red\". So Krypton is unlikely.\n*   **Candidate Sb**: Antimony mainly forms SbF3 and SbF5. The existence of five distinct binary compounds is not well-established. For A1 to decompose to A2 (SbF3) and F2, A1 must be a higher fluoride like SbF5. However, SbF5 is a colorless liquid and is stable at room temperature, it does not decompose at 293 K. This contradicts the description of A1. So Antimony is unlikely.\n*   **Candidate Pu**: Plutonium is known to form at least five binary fluorides (PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6, Pu2F9). PuF6 is a strong oxidizing agent (reacts with Xe) and is described as a reddish-brown solid which is a plausible match for \"bright-red\". Crucially, PuF6 is thermally unstable and decomposes at room temperature into PuF4 and F2 gas (PuF6 → PuF4 + F2).\n\nThis set of properties provides a strong match for:\n*   **Y = Plutonium (Pu)**\n*   **A1 = Plutonium hexafluoride (PuF6)**\n*   **A2 = Plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF4)**\n*   **A3 = PuF6** (it is also a strong oxidizing agent and is formed by fluorinating Pu).\n\nThere is a conflict: The decomposition A1(PuF6) → A2(PuF4) fits perfectly, but the mass percentage given for A2 (31.96%) matches A1(PuF6), not A2(PuF4) which has ωF ≈ 24%. This is likely a common type of error in chemical problems where a property is misattributed. Given that all other chemical facts point strongly to the PuF6/PuF4 identification, we will proceed assuming the mass percentage was meant for A1, not A2.\n\n**Step 3: Identify substance A4.**\n\nWe now need to identify A4 based on the final clue: \"By adding Y (Pu) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\nThis describes the reaction: Pu + A4 → A5 (1:1 mole ratio)\n\nA4 is another binary fluoride of plutonium. The known fluorides are PuF3, PuF4, PuF6. (We also know PuF5 and Pu2F9 exist).\n*   A1 and A3 are PuF6, so A4 is not PuF6.\n*   A2 is PuF4, so A4 is not PuF4.\n*   This leaves **A4 = PuF3**.\n\nLet's check if the reaction makes sense with A4 = PuF3. The problem statement describes adding elemental Pu to a solution of A4. The 1:1 molar ratio suggests a reaction where Pu metal reduces a higher oxidation state fluoride. However, adding Pu(0) to PuF3 (Pu in +3 state) would not involve a simple 1:1 comproportionation to form a stable intermediate fluoride.\nLet's reconsider the wording \"adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to... A4\". This could describe the preparation of a mixed-valence compound. Indeed, the compound known as Pu2F9 is more accurately represented as [Pu(III)F2]n[Pu(V)F7]n or a similar structure, but it is formed from PuF3 and PuF6.\n\nThere seems to be ambiguity or a simplification in the reaction description. However, following the process of elimination based on identifying A1, A2, and A3, the most logical remaining candidate for A4 is **PuF3**.\n\nThe question is about the solution of A4 being \"colorless\". Plutonium ions are famous for having colored solutions (Pu(III) is blue/violet, Pu(IV) is yellow-brown). A colorless solution is unexpected. This is another significant inconsistency in the problem statement. However, given the options, we must select the most plausible path. Eliminating the already identified fluorides is the most logical step.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n\nAssuming A4 is PuF3:\n*   Molar mass of Pu (using the most common isotope for calculation, Pu-239): 239.05 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of F: 18.998 g/mol.\n*   Molecular weight of PuF3 = M(Pu) + 3 * M(F) = 239.05 + 3 * 18.998 = 239.05 + 56.994 = **296.044 g/mol**.\n\nUsing the isotope Pu-244 gives M(PuF3) = 244 + 57 = 301 g/mol. Regardless of the isotope, the molecular weight is near 300.\n\nLet's re-examine the question. Perhaps my assignment of A1/A2 is wrong and A4 is something else.\nWhat if A2=SbF3 is correct, and all the properties of A1 are wrong?\nY = Sb, A2=SbF3, A1=SbF5, A3=SbF5. Then A4 could be... there are only two fluorides. A4 and A5 would have to be SbF3 and SbF5.\nIf A4 = SbF5, the reaction is Sb + SbF5 (1:1). Sb(0) + Sb(+5) -> No simple 1:1 product.\nIf A4 = SbF3, the reaction is Sb + SbF3 (1:1). Sb(0) + Sb(+3) -> No simple 1:1 product.\nThe antimony hypothesis leads to dead ends.\n\nLet's return to the most likely, though flawed, Plutonium hypothesis:\nY=Pu, A1=PuF6, A2=PuF4, A3=PuF6.\nThe remaining major fluorides are PuF3 and PuF5. Let's consider A4 could be either.\nMW(PuF3) ≈ 296-301 g/mol.\nMW(PuF5) = 244 + 5*19 = 339 g/mol.\n\nThe provided answer choices are:\nA) 110-130\nB) 140-160\nC) 160-180\nD) 220-240\n\nNone of the molecular weights for PuF3 or PuF5 fit into these ranges. This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding or a severe error in the problem as interpreted.\n\nLet's re-read everything one last time. There must be another interpretation.\nMaybe the element Y is something different, and my initial scan was incomplete. What if the description of A1 being \"bright-red\" and decomposing at RT is the key? This strongly points away from SbF5 and KrF4. It fits PuF6 very well. Let's trust this clue above all others. If A1 is PuF6, then Y=Pu.\nIf Y=Pu, the binary fluorides are PuF3, PuF4, PuF6...\nLet's assume the molecular weights in the options (A,B,C,D) must be correct for A4.\nIf MW(A4) is in range D (220-240), could it be a Pu compound? No. The lightest is PuF3 (~296).\nThis means Y cannot be Pu. This is a total contradiction.\n\nLet's reconsider Sb. Y=Sb. A2=SbF3 (MW ≈ 178.8, %F=31.89%).\nLet's assume the descriptions of A1 are wrong, but A2=SbF3 is correct because the math is the tightest fit.\nA1 would be SbF5. A3 would be SbF5. A4 would have to be either SbF3 or SbF5.\nMW(SbF3) = 178.8 g/mol. This falls in range C (160-180).\nMW(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5*19 = 216.76 g/mol.\nThe reaction Sb + A4 -> A5 (1:1). Still problematic.\n\nWhat about Chlorine? ClF, ClF3, ClF5. Only 3 fluorides.\nA2=ClF_n, %F=31.96.\nLet's check: %F in ClF3 = (3*19)/(35.5+57) = 57/92.5 = 61.6%. No.\nWhat about Bromine again? Y=Br, A2 = ???. The %F doesn't match any stable fluoride.\n\nLet's go back to Sb. Y=Sb, A2=SbF3. MW(A2)=178.8. Let's assume A1=SbF5 despite the wrong color and stability. Let A4 be SbF5. MW(SbF5)=216.76. Doesn't fit the ranges well. Let A4 be SbF3. MW=178.8, fits range C.\nLet's test this scenario: **A4 = SbF3**.\nThe reaction is: Sb + SbF3 (in 1:1 ratio) -> A5.\nThis reaction doesn't seem to lead to a known antimony fluoride, A5.\nThe puzzle is deeply flawed. However, in such contest problems, sometimes one must choose the \"least wrong\" path. The match between SbF3 and the mass percentage for A2 is numerically excellent (31.89% vs 31.96%).\nLet's assume:\n*   Y = Sb\n*   A2 = SbF3 (from mass%)\n*   A1 = SbF5 (highest fluoride, strong oxidizer/superacid reacts with Xe) -> ignore color/stability problems.\n*   A3 = SbF5 (same logic)\n*   The known fluorides are SbF3 and SbF5. Let's assume others like SbF4 exist to meet the \"five fluorides\" criteria.\n*   A4 and A5 are SbF3 and SbF5.\n*   \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". SbF5 is a liquid, SbF3 is a solid. It could be a solution of SbF3 in liquid SbF5 or another solvent. Both SbF3 and SbF5 are colorless.\n*   If **A4 = SbF5**, MW=216.8 g/mol. Closest range is D (220-240). Let's check reaction: Sb + SbF5 -> A5 (1:1). Comproportionation could lead to SbF3. Let's balance: 2Sb + 3SbF5 → 5SbF3. The ratio is not 1:1.\n*   If **A4 = SbF3**, MW=178.8 g/mol. This falls squarely in range **C (160-180)**. Let's check reaction: Sb + SbF3 -> A5 (1:1). Not a standard reaction.\n\nLet's try one final radical idea. Let's re-read this: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" What if A4 is Y itself dissolved in something, and A5 is the fluoride? This is not how the sentence is structured. A4 is clearly a distinct substance from Y.\n\nGiven the irreconcilable contradictions in the Plutonium path (molecular weight ranges) and the chemical reaction problems in the Antimony path, let's focus only on the molecular weights. The calculation for A2 yielded SbF3 as a very strong candidate. The MW of SbF3 is 178.8. If we assume A4 is SbF3, it fits range C. The MW of SbF5 is 216.8. If A4 is SbF5, it is closest to range D. The description of A4 having a \"colorless concentrated solution\" might favor the liquid SbF5 over the solid SbF3. If A4 = SbF5, its molecular weight is 216.8 g/mol. This is close to the range 220-240.\n\nHowever, let's revisit the prompt with another element: Rhenium (Re). M=186.2 g/mol. Known fluorides: ReF4, ReF5, ReF6, ReF7.\nA2 = ReF_n, %F=31.96. If n=4, M(Y) = 161.8 (No). If n=5, M(Y) = 202.25 (No).\nIf we test ReF6: %F = (6*19)/(186.2 + 114) = 114/300.2 = 38%. No.\n\nLet's go back to Y=Sb and A2=SbF3. MW(SbF3) = 178.8 (in range C). A4=SbF3 is a possibility.\nLet's try Y=Sb and A2=SbF5? %F in SbF5 = (5*19)/(121.8+95) = 95/216.8 = 43.8%. No.\n\nThe most consistent numerical data point is A2=SbF3. If we assume one of the other fluorides must be A4, the only other common option is SbF5 (MW=216.8 g/mol). This falls just outside range D, but is closest to it. What if we are looking for the MW of A3? No, it asks for A4.\n\nLet's assume A4=SbF5 and there's some slight inaccuracy in the provided ranges. MW=216.8 is closest to D.\n\nBut there is another possibility. Let's check what A5 might be. What if Y+A4=A5 means Pu + PuF6 -> PuF4 + PuF3 ... this is getting too speculative.\n\nLet's retry Y=Au (Gold), M=197. n=5, M(Y)=202. %F in AuF5 = 32.5%. Close-ish.\nA1=AuF7? (red solid, unstable) decomposes to AuF5+F2. A2=AuF5. %F=32.5% is close to 31.96%. Five fluorides not known. A1(AuF7) oxidizes Xe. This is a plausible path.\nY=Au. A1=AuF7. A2=AuF5. A3=AuF7.\nA4 must be another gold fluoride. AuF3 is known. MW(AuF3)=197 + 3*19 = 254. This is not in any range.\n\nGiven the severe inconsistencies, let's reconsider Y=Sb. A2=SbF3. A4 is likely SbF5 or SbF3. MW(SbF3) = 178.8 (Range C). MW(SbF5)=216.8 (Closest to D). Let's think about the last sentence. A5 decomposes in water into two substances.\nIf Y=Sb, A4=SbF5, the reaction with Sb to give A5 is unclear. But let's check the hydrolysis of antimony fluorides. SbF5 + 2H2O -> SbO2F + 4HF. (Two substances). SbF3 + H2O -> SbOF + 2HF (Two substances). So this doesn't help distinguish.\n\nLet's assume A4 = SbF5 (as a liquid, it can be a \"concentrated solution\" of itself). MW=216.8 g/mol.\nThe range 220-240 is very close. This is a plausible, though not perfect, choice.\n\nFinal Check: Let's assume A4 falls in range B (140-160).\nCould A4 be TeF6? M(TeF6) = 127.6 + 6*19 = 241.6. No.\nCould A4 be MoF6? M(MoF6) = 96 + 114 = 210. No.\nWhat compound could have MW 140-160? BrF5 = 175 (No). IF3=184 (No).\nThe element Y must be heavy for its fluorides to reach these molecular weights. The Y=Sb path seems the most likely intended solution despite its flaws. And if so, A4 is likely SbF5 (the other major fluoride), placing its molecular weight near range D.\n\nLet's reconsider the ranges and my calculation for SbF5. M(SbF5)=216.76. Range D is 220-240. The difference is 3.24. This is a small discrepancy. Let's assume this is the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
