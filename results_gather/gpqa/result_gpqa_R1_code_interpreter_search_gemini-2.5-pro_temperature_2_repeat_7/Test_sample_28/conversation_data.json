This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nMutant 1:\n5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 2:\n5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 3:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\nMutant 4:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’<b>\n\nA) Mutant 4\nB) Mutant 3\nC) Mutant 1\nD) Mutant 2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "*   **Analysis of the Goal:** The objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound synthesized by a specific gene. The most effective way to achieve this is to completely disrupt the function of the protein encoded by this gene. This is best accomplished by creating a null allele, meaning the gene produces a non-functional protein or no protein at all.\n\n*   **Understanding Gene Expression:** The gene sequence begins with `ATG`, the start codon for translation, which codes for the amino acid Methionine (Met). The ribosome reads the DNA sequence in groups of three bases (codons) to build a protein. Translation stops when a stop codon (e.g., TGA, TAA, TAG) is reached.\n\n*   **Evaluating Mutation Types:**\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** A change in a single nucleotide that results in a codon that codes for a different amino acid. This might alter the protein's function, but it's not guaranteed to eliminate it. The protein might still be partially or fully functional.\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** A change that does not alter the amino acid sequence. This has no effect on the protein.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change that results in a premature stop codon. This causes translation to halt, producing a truncated (shortened) protein. If this occurs early in the sequence, the resulting protein is almost certain to be non-functional.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of nucleotides in a number not divisible by three. This shifts the reading frame, changing all subsequent codons and usually leading to a completely different, non-functional protein that often terminates early.\n\n*   **Analyzing the Mutants:** Let's compare the beginning of each mutant sequence to the intact gene and see how the codons and resulting amino acids are affected.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT ... -3’`\n        *   Amino Acids: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - ...\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ... -3’`\n        *   Changes: The second codon `TTT` becomes `TTC` (still codes for Phe, a silent mutation). The third codon `CTC` (Leu) becomes `TAC` (Tyr).\n        *   Result: This is a **missense mutation** (Leucine to Tyrosine). It might not completely eliminate the protein's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ... -3’`\n        *   Changes: The second codon `TTT` becomes `TTC` (still codes for Phe, silent). The third codon `CTC` (Leu) becomes `TAA`.\n        *   Result: `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Translation will stop after the second amino acid, producing a tiny, non-functional peptide (Met-Phe). This is the most likely mutation to completely eliminate the protein's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ... -3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leu) becomes `TAC` (Tyr). This sequence also shows other changes further down.\n        *   Result: This is primarily a **missense mutation** at the beginning of the gene. Like Mutant 1, it's not guaranteed to inactivate the protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5'-ATG TTT TAC GCT ... -3'`\n        *   Change: Similar to Mutant 3, this also has a `CTC` to `TAC` missense mutation near the beginning.\n        *   Result: Another **missense mutation** that is not as certain to abolish function as a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the coding sequence. This will result in a severely truncated protein that is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional. Therefore, this mutation is the most likely to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
