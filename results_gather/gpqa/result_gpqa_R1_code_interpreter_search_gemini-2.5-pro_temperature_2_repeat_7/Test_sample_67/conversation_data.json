    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2, so its spin is described by the spin operators `S_x, S_y, S_z`.\n    *   The magnetic moment is `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin vector operator.\n    *   The magnetic field is `B_vec = B * z_hat` (along the +Z direction).\n    *   The Hamiltonian for this initial situation is `H_initial = -μ · B_vec = -γS_z * B`.\n    *   The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means the system is in its lowest energy state. The energy is `E = -γB * <S_z>`. To minimize energy, `γ<S_z>` must be maximized. Assuming `γ > 0` (like for a proton), this means `S_z` must be in its highest eigenvalue state, which is `+ħ/2`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is the \"spin-up\" state along the z-axis, denoted as `|+z>`. In matrix representation (the standard z-basis), this state is `|ψ(0)> = [[1], [0]]`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the New Situation (t >= 0):**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to `B_vec = B * y_hat` (along the +Y direction).\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H = -μ · B_vec = -γS_y * B`.\n    *   The `S_y` operator in the z-basis is `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    *   So, `H = -γB(ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Time Evolution and Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the expectation value of the z-component of the moment, `<μ_z(t)>`. This value will oscillate because the initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H`. A quantum system in a state that is a superposition of energy eigenstates will evolve in time, and the expectation values of observables will oscillate with frequencies determined by the energy differences between those eigenstates.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Using Energy Eigenvalues**\n        *   The oscillation frequency `ω` of a two-level system is directly related to the energy difference `ΔE` between its two energy eigenstates by the Bohr frequency condition: `ω = ΔE / ħ`.\n        *   Let's find the eigenvalues of the new Hamiltonian `H = -γB * S_y`.\n        *   The eigenvalues of `S_y` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n        *   Therefore, the energy eigenvalues of `H` are `E_1 = -γB * (+ħ/2)` and `E_2 = -γB * (-ħ/2)`.\n        *   So, `E_1 = -γBħ/2` and `E_2 = +γBħ/2`.\n        *   The energy difference is `ΔE = |E_1 - E_2| = |(-γBħ/2) - (γBħ/2)| = |-γBħ| = γBħ` (assuming `γ` and `B` are positive magnitudes).\n        *   The oscillation frequency is `ω = ΔE / ħ = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Direct Calculation of `<μ_z(t)>`**\n        *   We need to calculate `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n        *   The time evolution operator is `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ) = exp(i * γB*t/ħ * S_y)`.\n        *   Let `ω_L = γB` (this is the Larmor Frequency). `U(t) = exp(i * ω_L*t/ħ * S_y) = exp(i * (ω_L*t/2) * σ_y)`.\n        *   Using the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = cos(θ)I + i*sin(θ)σ_k`, where `θ = ω_L*t/2` and `σ_k = σ_y`:\n            `U(t) = cos(ω_L*t/2) * [[1,0],[0,1]] + i*sin(ω_L*t/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]`\n            `U(t) = [[cos(ω_L*t/2), sin(ω_L*t/2)], [-sin(ω_L*t/2), cos(ω_L*t/2)]]`\n        *   Now, apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)> = [[1], [0]]`:\n            `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)> = [[cos(ω_L*t/2)], [-sin(ω_L*t/2)]]`\n        *   This means `|ψ(t)> = cos(ω_L*t/2)|+z> - sin(ω_L*t/2)|-z>`.\n        *   Now we calculate the expectation value of `μ_z = γS_z`:\n            `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)>`.\n            `S_z` is `(ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]`.\n            `<S_z(t)> = [cos(ω_L*t/2), -sin(ω_L*t/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]] * [[cos(ω_L*t/2)], [-sin(ω_L*t/2)]]`\n            `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * [cos(ω_L*t/2), -sin(ω_L*t/2)] * [[cos(ω_L*t/2)], [sin(ω_L*t/2)]]`\n            `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ω_L*t/2) - sin²(ω_L*t/2))`\n        *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`, we get:\n            `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(ω_L*t)`.\n        *   So, `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = (γħ/2) * cos(ω_L*t)`.\n        *   The time-dependent term is `cos(ω_L*t)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω_L`.\n        *   Since we defined `ω_L = γB`, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both methods yield the same result. The phenomenon described is Larmor precession. The spin vector, initially along Z, precesses around the new magnetic field axis (Y). Its Z-component oscillates sinusoidally. The frequency of this precession and oscillation is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n\n    Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n    B) gamma*B/2\n    C) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n    D) gamma*B\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
