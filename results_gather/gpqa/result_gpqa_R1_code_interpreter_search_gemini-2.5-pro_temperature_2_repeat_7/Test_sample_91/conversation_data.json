    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound, we will follow these steps based on Hess's Law and bond energy data. The enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) can be calculated using the formula:\nΔHf° = [Total enthalpy of atomization of elements in their standard states] - [Enthalpy of atomization of the compound]\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's count the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms:\n*   Carbons (C): 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 (C=) + 1 (=CH) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (CH) + 1 (CH3) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (=CH) + 1 (=C) + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 12 carbons.\n*   Hydrogens (H): 2*3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2*3 = 22 hydrogens.\nThe molecular formula is C12H22.\n\n**Step 2: Count the Bonds**\nWe need to determine the number of each type of bond in one molecule of the compound.\n*   **C-H bonds:** Count all hydrogen atoms, as each is bonded to a carbon. There are 22 H atoms, so there are 22 C-H bonds.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure contains two double bonds: C=CH and CH=C. So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** We can find this by subtracting the carbons in C=C bonds from the total C-C links. Total carbon atoms = 12.\n    The main carbon chain can be visualized as C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C. If all were single bonds, there would be 11 C-C links.\n    The structure has 2 C=C bonds and 9 C-C bonds. Let's verify by drawing and counting:\n    Structure: `(CH3)2=C(1)-CH(2)-CH2(3)-CH(CH3)(4)-CH2(5)-CH(6)=C(CH3)2(7)`\n    - C-C single bonds in the backbone: C1-C2, C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6. (5 bonds)\n    - C-C single bonds in the side groups:\n        - 2 bonds for (CH3)2 on C1\n        - 1 bond for (CH3) on C4\n        - 2 bonds for (CH3)2 on C7\n    - Total C-C bonds = 4 (in chain) + 2 + 1 + 2 = 9 bonds.\nSo, we have:\n*   22 C-H bonds\n*   9 C-C bonds\n*   2 C=C bonds\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound to form gaseous atoms. It is the sum of all bond energies.\nΔH_atomization(compound) = (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H)) + (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C))\nUsing the given values:\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\nΔH_atomization(compound) = (22 × 400) + (9 × 200) + (2 × 300)\nΔH_atomization(compound) = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = 11200 kJ/mol\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements**\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states (C(graphite), H2(g)) to gaseous atoms (C(g), H(g)).\nThe formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n*   For Carbon: 12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n    Energy = 12 × ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 × 1000 = 12000 kJ\n*   For Hydrogen: 11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n    Energy = 11 × BE(H-H) = 11 × 100 = 1100 kJ\nTotal enthalpy of atomization of elements = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\nΔHf° = [Total enthalpy of atomization of elements] - [Enthalpy of atomization of compound]\nΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol\n\n**Step 6: Check the Options**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol.\nLet's examine the given options:\nA) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not its formation)\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 67.4 kJ/mol\nD) 1900 kJ/g (The numerical value matches, but the unit is per gram)\n\nSince our calculated molar enthalpy (1900 kJ/mol) is not an option, but an option with the same number (1900) but different units (kJ/g) exists, let's convert our answer to kJ/g to see if it matches any other option.\n\n**Step 7: Convert Enthalpy of Formation to kJ/g**\nFirst, calculate the molar mass of C12H22.\nMolar Mass (M) = (12 × 12.011) + (22 × 1.008) g/mol ≈ 166.3 g/mol. Using integer masses for simplicity as is common in such problems, M = 12*12 + 22*1 = 166 g/mol.\nΔHf° (in kJ/g) = ΔHf° (in kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (in g/mol)\nΔHf° (in kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ 11.445 kJ/g\n\nThis value (11.445 kJ/g) matches option B (11.44 kJ/g) very well. It is common in multiple-choice questions for the answer to be presented in units that require conversion. Option D has the correct numerical value but incorrect units that would represent a physically enormous and incorrect amount of energy if interpreted as written. Therefore, option B is the most plausible correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
