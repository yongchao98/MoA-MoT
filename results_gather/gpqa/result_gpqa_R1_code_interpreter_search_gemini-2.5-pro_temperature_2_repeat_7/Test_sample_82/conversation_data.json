    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation for two points in a titration process: the 25% titration point and the equivalence point.\n\n**Part 1: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Dilution of Acetic Acid:**\n    First, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water. We use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2.\n    *   Initial concentration (M1) = 0.05 M\n    *   Initial volume (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Final volume (V2) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n    *   Final concentration (M2) = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n    So, the concentration of the acetic acid solution being titrated is 0.025 M.\n\n2.  **Buffer Region Chemistry:**\n    At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has reacted with the strong base NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The remaining 75% of the acetic acid is unreacted. The solution now contains a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, which constitutes a buffer.\n\n    *   Reaction: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n    *   Ratio of conjugate base to weak acid: [CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH] = 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n\n3.  **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:**\n    To find the pH of this buffer solution, we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    Where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka value:\n        pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n    *   Now, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n        pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n        pH = 4.733 - log(3)\n        pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n    *   So, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n\n**Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Equivalence Point Chemistry:**\n    At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH. The resulting solution contains only the salt, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce hydroxide ions (OH⁻), making the solution basic.\n    *   Hydrolysis reaction: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\n2.  **Calculate the Volume and Concentration at Equivalence:**\n    *   First, find the moles of acetic acid initially present:\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 M × 0.0400 L = 0.001 moles\n    *   At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equals the initial moles of acetic acid. Calculate the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required:\n        Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n    *   Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n        Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n    *   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]) in the solution:\n        [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for the acetate ion. We can find it from the acid dissociation constant, Ka, and the ion product of water, Kw (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C).\n        Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Now we set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis reaction:\n        Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n        Let x be the concentration of [OH⁻] at equilibrium.\n        5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can assume that x is much smaller than 0.02, so (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n        5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n        x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n        x = √ (1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n    *   So, [OH⁻] = 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   Calculate pOH:\n        pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   Calculate pH:\n        pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n    *   The pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. These values correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
