    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Scenario:** We have a star with two distinct hemispheres. One is \"clean\" with a uniform temperature (`T_star`). The other is covered with dark, cooler spots, where 20% of its surface is spot-covered (`f = 0.20`). Due to the star's rotation, we will see alternating views of these two hemispheres, causing the star's measured brightness (flux) to vary.\n\n2.  **Model the Brightness Variation:** The brightness we observe is proportional to the total flux radiated from the hemisphere facing us. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the flux emitted per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (`F ∝ T^4`).\n\n    *   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is proportional to `T_star^4`.\n    *   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is a weighted average of the unspotted part and the spotted part of this hemisphere.\n        *   The unspotted area fraction is `(1 - f)`.\n        *   The spotted area fraction is `f`.\n        *   Therefore, the average flux is proportional to `(1 - f) * T_star^4 + f * T_spot^4`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Amplitude of Variation:** The amplitude of the signal is the relative change in flux between the maximum and minimum brightness.\n    *   Amplitude = `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n    *   Substituting the temperature dependencies:\n        Amplitude = `(T_star^4 - [(1 - f) * T_star^4 + f * T_spot^4]) / T_star^4`\n    *   Simplifying the numerator:\n        Amplitude = `(T_star^4 - T_star^4 + f * T_star^4 - f * T_spot^4) / T_star^4`\n        Amplitude = `(f * T_star^4 - f * T_spot^4) / T_star^4`\n    *   Factoring out `f` and `T_star^4`:\n        Amplitude = `f * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_star^4))`\n        Amplitude = `f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4)`\n\n4.  **Plug in the Given Values:**\n    *   `T_star` = 6000 K\n    *   Temperature difference = 1000 K, so `T_spot` = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K\n    *   `f` = 0.20\n    *   Amplitude = `0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)^4)`\n    *   Amplitude = `0.20 * (1 - (5/6)^4)`\n\n5.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit:** When a planet passes in front of (transits) its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The depth of this transit signal (which is its amplitude) is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n    *   Transit Depth = `(Area_planet) / (Area_star)`\n    *   Transit Depth = `(π * R_pl^2) / (π * R_star^2)`\n    *   Transit Depth = `(R_pl / R_star)^2`\n\n6.  **Equate the two Amplitudes:** We need to find the relative planet radius (`R_pl / R_star`) that produces the same signal amplitude as the rotating spotted star.\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)^2` = Amplitude from spots\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)^2` = `0.20 * (1 - (5/6)^4)`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star` = `sqrt(0.20 * (1 - (5/6)^4))`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:** A Python script can compute this accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given parameters\nT_star = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000.0  # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\nf = 0.20         # Filling factor of the spots\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the amplitude of the signal caused by the spotted hemisphere.\n# The formula is Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)**4)\namplitude_spot = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)**4)\n\n# Step 2: The amplitude of a transiting exoplanet signal is given by (R_pl / R_star)**2.\n# We set this equal to the amplitude from the spots to find the equivalent planet radius.\n# (R_pl / R_star)**2 = amplitude_spot\n\n# Step 3: Solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star).\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude_spot)\n\nprint(f\"{relative_radius:.4f}\")\n```\n\n```output\n0.3218\n```\n\nThe calculated relative radius is approximately 0.3218. This value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`Rpl`) relative to its host star's radius (`Rstar`) that would produce a transit signal with the same amplitude as the brightness variation caused by a rotating, spotted star.\n\n### **1. Calculate the Brightness Variation due to Starspots**\n\nThe brightness (or flux) we observe from a star is determined by its surface temperature, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, where Flux per unit area `(F) ∝ T_eff^4`.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is proportional to the star's effective temperature (`T_star`) raised to the fourth power.\n    `F_max ∝ T_star^4`\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere's surface is a mix of normal photosphere and cooler spots.\n    *   Fraction of the area at `T_star` is `(1 - f)`, where `f` is the spot filling factor.\n    *   Fraction of the area at `T_spot` is `f`.\n    *   The total flux is the weighted average of the two components.\n    `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_star^4 + f * T_spot^4`\n\nThe amplitude of this brightness variation is the relative change in flux:\n`Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for flux:\n`Amplitude = (T_star^4 - [(1 - f) * T_star^4 + f * T_spot^4]) / T_star^4`\n\nSimplifying the numerator:\n`Amplitude = (T_star^4 - T_star^4 + f * T_star^4 - f * T_spot^4) / T_star^4`\n`Amplitude = (f * T_star^4 - f * T_spot^4) / T_star^4`\n\nFactoring out `f` and simplifying the fraction:\n`Amplitude = f * (1 - T_spot^4 / T_star^4) = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4)`\n\n### **2. Model the Exoplanet Transit Signal**\n\nWhen an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The depth of this transit signal (its amplitude) is the ratio of the planet's circular area to the star's circular area.\n`Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)`\n`Transit Depth = (π * R_pl^2) / (π * R_star^2)`\n`Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)^2`\n\n### **3. Equate the Amplitudes and Solve**\n\nTo find the exoplanet that mimics the starspot signal, we set the amplitudes equal to each other:\n`(R_pl / R_star)^2 = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4)`\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius, `R_pl / R_star`:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4) ]`\n\n### **4. Calculation**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `T_star` = 6000 K\n*   Temperature difference = 1000 K, so `T_spot` = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   Spot filling factor, `f` = 20% = 0.20\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)^4) ]`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ]`\n\nThe result from the Python code execution is `0.3218`.\n\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.32`\n\nThis value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
