    "*   **Step 1: Decode the information from the question.**\n    1.  **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached.\n    2.  **Molecular Formula:** A total of 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n    3.  **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n        *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n        *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the molecular structure.**\n    *   We have a benzene ring (C6).\n    *   One substituent is a halogen, -X (which has 0 carbons).\n    *   The other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The only common and stable arrangement for a C2 group with a carbonyl is an acetyl group: -C(=O)CH3.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The general formula is X-C6H4-COCH3.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 4 on the ring and 3 on the methyl group, for a total of 7 hydrogens. The 1H NMR spectrum should show a total integration of 7H.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum based on possible isomers (ortho, meta, para).**\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum will have signals for the aromatic protons (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) and the methyl protons of the acetyl group.\n    *   **Acetyl Group (-COCH3):** This group will always show up as a **singlet** (as there are no adjacent protons) with an integration of **3H**. The carbonyl group is deshielding, so the chemical shift will be around 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons on the ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern:\n        *   *ortho (1,2-substituted):* Would result in four distinct and complex signals (multiplets) in the aromatic region, each integrating to 1H.\n        *   *meta (1,3-substituted):* Would also result in four complex signals, though sometimes one might appear as a singlet if it's flanked by the two substituents. It's generally a complex pattern of four 1H signals.\n        *   *para (1,4-substituted):* Due to symmetry, there are only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons. This leads to a characteristic, simplified pattern: two **doublets**, each integrating to **2H**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the given NMR data options.**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The integrations (1H, 2H, 2H, 2H) sum to 7H, which is correct. However, it lacks a 3H singlet for the acetyl methyl group. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Integration:** 2H + 2H + 3H = 7H. Correct.\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). This pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, is the classic signature of a **para-substituted** benzene ring.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** 2.3 (3H, s). This is a singlet integrating to 3H, at a chemical shift perfect for the methyl group of an acetyl ketone (-COCH3).\n        *   This spectrum perfectly matches the expected data for **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. This would correspond to a structure like halo-phenylacetaldehyde. While this structure also has 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and an Ar-X bond, the protons of the -CH2-CHO group would couple with each other, resulting in a doublet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CHO, not two singlets. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum completely lacks signals in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), which is impossible for a compound containing a benzene ring. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B is the only one that correctly describes the 1H NMR spectrum of a di-substituted 8-carbon aromatic compound containing a carbonyl and an Ar-X bond, which is identified as a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<B>>>"
