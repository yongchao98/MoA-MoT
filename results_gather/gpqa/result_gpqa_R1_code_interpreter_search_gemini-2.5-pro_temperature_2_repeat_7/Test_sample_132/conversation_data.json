    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their initial concentrations.**\n    *   The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n    *   In solution, KH2PO4 dissociates completely into K+ and dihydrogen phosphate ions (H2PO4-).\n    *   In solution, Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates completely into 2 Na+ ions, hydrogen phosphate ions (HPO4^2-), and 2 water molecules.\n    *   Therefore, the main phosphate species in solution are H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, which form a conjugate acid-base buffer pair.\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles and concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   Volume of the solution (V) = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 (Mw1) = 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O (Mw2) = 177.99 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = Moles of H2PO4- = Mass / Mw1 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol.\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Moles of HPO4^2- = Mass / Mw2 = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol.\n    *   Concentration of H2PO4- = [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M.\n    *   Concentration of HPO4^2- = [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer.**\n    *   The pH of the buffer is governed by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid (H3PO4):\n        H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n    *   The expression for Ka2 is: Ka2 = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺], assuming the equilibrium concentrations of the buffer components are approximately equal to their initial concentrations.\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4³⁻].**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO4³⁻) is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n        HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n    *   The expression for Ka3 is: Ka3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4³⁻]:\n    *   [PO4³⁻] = Ka3 * ([HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   We use the calculated [H⁺] and the initial concentration of [HPO4²⁻] (since its dissociation is negligible).\n    *   [PO4³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10⁻⁸ M) ≈ 6.23x10⁻⁷ M.\n\nTo obtain a more precise result, let's perform the calculation using a script.\n```python\n# Given values\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume = 0.200  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Calculate moles of the species\nmoles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nmoles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n# Calculate concentrations\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume\n\n# Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the Ka2 equilibrium\n# H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nh_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium\n# HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\npo4_3minus_conc = Ka3 * (conc_hpo4_2minus / h_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{po4_3minus_conc:.2e}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and reactions.**\n    The solution contains KH₂PO₄, which provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻), and Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O, which provides the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). These two ions form a conjugate acid-base pair that creates a buffer solution. The relevant equilibria are the second and third dissociations of phosphoric acid:\n    *   H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻  (Ka₂)\n    *   HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻  (Ka₃)\n    Our goal is to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻].\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    First, we calculate the moles of each salt added:\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ (and thus H₂PO₄⁻) = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (and thus HPO₄²⁻) = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n\n    Next, we find the concentrations in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution:\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] in the buffer.**\n    The pH of the buffer is primarily determined by the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ equilibrium (Ka₂). We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, but it's more direct to use the Ka₂ expression to find [H⁺]:\n    *   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Rearranging for [H⁺]: [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻].**\n    Now we use the third dissociation equilibrium (Ka₃) and the calculated [H⁺] to find [PO₄³⁻]. The concentration of HPO₄²⁻ is assumed to be its initial concentration because the dissociation governed by Ka₃ is very small.\n    *   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearranging for [PO₄³⁻]: [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10⁻⁸ M) ≈ 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis calculation is efficiently performed by the following Python script.\n\n```python\n# Given values for the calculation\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # Mass of KH2PO4 in grams\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # Molar mass of KH2PO4 in g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O in grams\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O in g/mol\nvolume = 0.200  # Volume of the solution in Liters\nKa2 = 6.2e-8  # Second dissociation constant for phosphoric acid\nKa3 = 1.8e-12  # Third dissociation constant for phosphoric acid\n\n# Calculate moles of the dissolved species\n# KH2PO4 provides the H2PO4- ion\nmoles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\n# Na2HPO4●2H2O provides the HPO4^2- ion\nmoles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n# Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume\n\n# Use the Ka2 equilibrium to determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]\n# H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nh_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# Use the Ka3 equilibrium and the calculated [H+] to find the orthophosphate concentration [PO4^3-]\n# HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\npo4_3minus_conc = Ka3 * (conc_hpo4_2minus / h_plus_conc)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{po4_3minus_conc:.2e}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
