    "This problem asks for the sequence of reactions that leads to the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It's a benzene ring with three substituents:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* relationship with each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\nLet's consider the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. This group is often used as a powerful director and then removed.\n*   **-NHCOCH3 (acetamido):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It's a protected form of the amino group.\n\n**2. Evaluate a Direct Synthesis Approach**\n\nA simple, direct approach would be to add the three groups sequentially to the benzene ring.\n*   **Path A:** Acetylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.\n    1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone. The -COCH3 group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 3-Nitroacetophenone. The nitration occurs at the meta position, which is position 3.\n    3.  3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> Both -COCH3 and -NO2 are *meta*-directors. They both direct the incoming bromine to position 5. This would give the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    This pathway is chemically sound and would lead to the correct product. However, it's a 3-step synthesis, and all the options provided are 7 steps long. This suggests a more complex strategy is intended, likely because the final bromination step on a ring deactivated by two groups (-COCH3 and -NO2) might have a low yield. The long sequences in the options, which include steps for diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) and deamination (H3PO2), strongly point towards a strategy where an amino group is used as a temporary directing group and then removed.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Synthesis Strategy Involving Deamination**\n\nThe deamination strategy involves using a powerful ortho,para-directing amino group to install substituents in specific locations and then removing it at the end of the synthesis. The final product has unsubstituted positions at 2, 4, and 6. This means the precursor molecule had an amino group at one of these positions, which was subsequently removed.\n\nLet's work backward. To get the final product by removing an amino group, the precursor must have been an aminobromonitroacetophenone. For example, if we remove an amino group from position 4, the precursor would be 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The removal of the -NH2 from C4 would leave substituents at C1(-COCH3), C3(-Br), and C5(-NO2), which is exactly the target molecule.\n\nLet's devise a synthesis for this precursor: 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\nA logical starting point for this is p-aminoacetophenone or its protected form, p-acetamidoacetophenone. Let's see how we can use its directing groups. The key intermediate is p-acetamidoacetophenone.\nOn this molecule (C1: -COCH3, C4: -NHCOCH3):\n*   The acetamido group (-NHCOCH3) is a strong activating *o,p*-director. It will direct incoming groups to its ortho positions (C3 and C5).\n*   The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a deactivating *m*-director. It directs to C3 and C5.\n\nBoth groups direct substituents to the same positions (3 and 5). This convergence of directing effects leads to high yields.\nLet's perform bromination and nitration:\n*   **Bromination first, then nitration:**\n    1.  *p-Acetamidoacetophenone* + Br2 -> The bromine will add to position 3 (ortho to -NHAc). Product: *4-acetamido-3-bromoacetophenone*.\n    2.  Nitrate this product: We have -NHAc (at C4), -Br (at C3), and -COCH3 (at C1).\n        *   -NHAc (strong o,p-director) directs to C5.\n        *   -Br (o,p-director) directs to C5 (para position).\n        *   -COCH3 (m-director) directs to C5.\n        All three groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. This is a highly selective reaction. Product: *4-acetamido-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone*.\n*   The sequence to get the final product from here is:\n    3.  **Hydrolysis** of the acetamido group (-NHCOCH3) to an amino group (-NH2) using acid (e.g., H3O+). Product: *4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone*.\n    4.  **Diazotization** of the amino group with NaNO2/HCl.\n    5.  **Deamination** (removal of the diazonium group) with H3PO2 to give the final product.\n\n**4. Match the Synthesis Path to the Options**\n\nNow, let's find the option that matches this logical, high-yield pathway. The key substitution order on the intermediate is Bromination then Nitration.\n\nThe required steps are:\nBenzene -> Aniline -> Acetanilide/p-aminoacetophenone intermediate -> Add acetyl group -> Bromination -> Nitration -> Hydrolysis -> Diazotization -> Deamination.\n\nLet's analyze Option B:\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n\n*   **i) & ii):** Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> Aniline. This creates the key starting amine.\n*   **iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3:** This step is meant to acylate aniline. While the reagents are typically for Friedel-Crafts acylation of a ring, in the context of these options, it's the step that introduces an acetyl group. Let's assume this sequence (perhaps N-acetylation followed by Fries Rearrangement, or FC acylation of acetanilide) produces the key intermediate *p-aminoacetophenone* (or *p-acetamidoacetophenone*).\n*   **iv) Br2/FeBr3:** This is bromination.\n*   **v) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is nitration.\n*   **vi) & vii):** This is the diazotization and deamination sequence.\n\nThis option follows the correct order of functional group introductions (apart from some ambiguities/missing steps like protection/deprotection): creation of an aniline derivative, followed by bromination, then nitration, and finally removal of the guiding amino group. The intermediate steps are guided by the powerful activating effects of the amino/acetamido group, leading to the desired regiochemistry in high yield. The implicit protection/deprotection steps are likely assumed or bundled into the reagent steps in this multiple-choice question format.\n\nLet's quickly check why other options fail:\n*   **A:** Creates benzene after 4 steps, making no sense.\n*   **C:** Nitrates 3-bromoacetophenone. The directors conflict, leading to a mixture of isomers and low yield of the required intermediate.\n*   **D:** Attempts Friedel-Crafts on a highly deactivated ring (p-bromonitrobenzene), which is difficult, and subsequent steps lead to the wrong isomer.\n\nTherefore, option B represents the most chemically sound and high-yield synthesis pathway, despite its condensed and somewhat imprecise notation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
