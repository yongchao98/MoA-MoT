    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition Process:**\n    The problem asks about the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0> (also known as the 3s state) to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0> (the 1s ground state). This decay happens via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules:**\n    For an electric dipole transition to occur, the following selection rules for the quantum numbers must be satisfied:\n    *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1\n    *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1\n\n3.  **Determine the First Transition Step:**\n    *   Initial state: |3,0,0>\n    *   A direct transition to |1,0,0> is forbidden because Δl = 0 - 0 = 0, which violates the Δl = ±1 rule. Therefore, a cascade via an intermediate state is necessary.\n    *   For the first transition from |3,0,0>, the selection rules require the intermediate state |n',l',m'> to have:\n        *   l' = l + 1 = 1 (since l=0 and l cannot be negative, only Δl=+1 is possible).\n        *   m' = m + Δm = 0 + (0, ±1) = 0, ±1.\n        *   n' must be less than 3 for an emission process. The options suggest n'=2. The |n'=2, l'=1> state is the 2p state.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. All three are valid possibilities.\n\n4.  **Determine the Second Transition Step:**\n    *   The second transition is from one of the intermediate states |2,1,m'> to the final state |1,0,0>.\n    *   Let's check the selection rules for this step:\n        *   Δl = l_final - l'_initial = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n        *   Δm = m_final - m'_initial = 0 - m'. This is allowed for m' = 0, ±1, as the result will be 0, ∓1.\n    *   So, all three routes proposed in options A, B, and D are valid sequences of dipole transitions:\n        *   |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n        *   |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n        *   |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability of Each Route:**\n    The \"probability\" in this context refers to the branching ratio of the decay. The probability of a specific cascade path is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step (Branching ratio for 3s → 2p):**\n        The initial state |3,0,0> is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric (l=0). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space (i.e., the choice of the z-axis is arbitrary). The decay process must reflect this symmetry. The three possible final states for this step, |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>, are the magnetic sublevels of the p-orbital (l=1). Due to the rotational symmetry of the initial state and the interaction, the probability of decaying into any of these three sublevels must be equal.\n        Therefore, the probability of decaying into any specific m' state is 1/3.\n        *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3\n        *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3\n        *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step (Branching ratio for 2p → 1s):**\n        Once the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'> states (the 2p level), it will decay to a lower energy state. The only available state with lower energy is the |1,0,0> ground state (1s). The transition from l=1 to l=0 is allowed by the dipole selection rules. Since this is the only possible decay channel, any atom that reaches the 2p level is guaranteed to decay to the 1s state.\n        Therefore, the branching ratio for this step is 1 (or 100%).\n        *   P(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>) = 1, for any m'.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:**\n        The total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps. Let's calculate it for the route in option B:\n        Total P = P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) × P(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>)\n        Total P = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n\n        The probability for the routes in options A and D would also be 1/3.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) Route |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> is valid, but the probability is listed as 1/4, which is incorrect.\n    *   B) Route |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> is valid, and the probability is listed as 1/3, which is correct.\n    *   C) The initial state is written with a typo, and the probability is 2/3, which is incorrect.\n    *   D) Route |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> is valid, but the probability is listed as 1/4, which is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option B is the only choice that presents a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<B>>>"
