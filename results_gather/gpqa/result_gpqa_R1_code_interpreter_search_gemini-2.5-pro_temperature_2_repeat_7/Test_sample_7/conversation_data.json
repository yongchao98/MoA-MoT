    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the role of Gene G2.**\n    The single mutant `g2` shows 0% resistance, a complete loss of the wild-type phenotype. The double mutants involving `g2` (`g1g2` and `g2g3`) also show 0% resistance. When the phenotype of a double mutant (`g1g2`) is identical to the phenotype of one of the single mutants (`g2`), it indicates an epistatic interaction. Specifically, the `g2` mutation is epistatic to the `g1` and `g3` mutations, meaning the effect of `g2` masks the effects of `g1` and `g3`. In a regulatory pathway, the upstream gene is epistatic to the downstream genes. Given that at least one gene is a transcription factor, this result strongly suggests that G2 is an upstream transcription factor that is essential for the activation of the entire resistance pathway. If G2 is knocked out, the downstream genes (like G1 and G3) cannot be expressed or cannot function, leading to a complete loss of resistance regardless of the status of G1 or G3. This conclusion eliminates option C, which proposes G1 as the transcription factor.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the relationship between G1 and G3.**\n    *   The single mutant `g1` has 75% resistance (a 25% loss from control).\n    *   The single mutant `g3` has 50% resistance (a 50% loss from control).\n    *   The double mutant `g1g3` has 10% resistance (a 90% loss from control).\n\n    If the genes acted in separate, independent pathways, we would expect the effects to be additive or multiplicative. For example, an additive effect would result in a 25% + 50% = 75% loss, leaving 25% resistance. The observed loss of 90% is much greater than the sum of the individual losses (75%). This type of genetic interaction, where the double mutant shows a much more severe phenotype than expected from the single mutants, is called a **synergistic interaction**. Synergy often implies that the two genes have partially overlapping or compensatory functions, a concept known as **gene redundancy**. When one gene is knocked out, the other can partially compensate for its function. When both are knocked out, the function is almost completely lost. Therefore, describing G1 and G3 as showing gene redundancy is a correct interpretation of the data. This makes the term \"gene redundancy\" in option B a better fit than \"pleiotropy\" in option D (pleiotropy means one gene affects multiple traits, which is not what the data shows).\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the epistasis statement between G1 and G3.**\n    The options A, B, and D include a statement about epistasis between G1 and G3. For G1 to be epistatic to G3, the `g1g3` phenotype would need to be the same as the `g1` phenotype (75% resistance). For G3 to be epistatic to G1, the `g1g3` phenotype would have to be the same as the `g3` phenotype (50% resistance). The actual `g1g3` phenotype is 10%. Therefore, neither gene is epistatic to the other; they show synergy. This indicates there is an error in the third clause of options A, B, and D.\n\n*   **Step 4: Select the best option.**\n    We must choose the option that is most consistent with the data, even if it contains a flaw.\n    *   **Option A:** \"G2 is a transcription factor\" (Correct). \"G1 and G3 has the same promoter\" (Plausible, but an inference about mechanism, not a direct conclusion from the interaction data). \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" (Incorrect).\n    *   **Option B:** \"G2 is a transcription factor\" (Correct). \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\" (Correct interpretation of the synergistic interaction). \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" (Incorrect).\n    *   **Option C:** \"G1 is a transcription factor\" (Incorrect).\n    *   **Option D:** \"G2 is a transcription factor\" (Correct). \"G1 and G3 show pleiotropy\" (Incorrect term for this interaction). \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" (Incorrect).\n\n    Comparing the options, Option B contains two correct and highly relevant conclusions drawn directly from the data (G2 as a TF, and G1/G3 redundancy), despite having one incorrect clause. This makes it the most accurate description of the genetic interactions among the choices provided.\n\n<<<B>>>"
