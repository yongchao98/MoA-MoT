    "Here's the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the System\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are **fermions**.\n*   **Key Principle:** Identical fermions obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Quantum State:** For a particle in a potential well, a quantum state is defined by its energy level (principal quantum number, *n*) and its spin (spin quantum number, *m_s*). For spin-1/2 particles, the spin can be either spin-up (+1/2) or spin-down (-1/2).\n*   **Implication:** Because of the two possible spin states, each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of **two** fermions (one spin-up and one spin-down).\n\n### 2. Single-Particle Energy Levels\n*   **The System:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Energy Formula:** The energy for a single particle in such a well is given by:\n    E_n = (n^2 * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²)\n    where *n* = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n*   **Given Unit of Energy:** The problem defines a base energy unit E = (π² * ħ²) / (2mL²).\n*   **Simplified Energy Levels:** We can express the energy of each level in terms of E:\n    *   E₁ = 1² * E = 1E\n    *   E₂ = 2² * E = 4E\n    *   E₃ = 3² * E = 9E\n    *   E₄ = 4² * E = 16E\n    *   ...and so on.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Total Energies of the Multi-Particle System\n\nTo find the energy of the system for a given state (ground, first excited, etc.), we sum the energies of all four particles in their respective levels.\n\n#### a) Ground State Energy (E_ground)\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n1.  **Level n=1 (Energy = 1E):** We place the first two fermions here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n2.  **Level n=2 (Energy = 4E):** We place the remaining two fermions here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n3.  **Total Ground State Energy:** Sum the energies of all four particles.\n    E_ground = (2 particles × E₁) + (2 particles × E₂)\n    E_ground = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E)\n    E_ground = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n#### b) First Excited State Energy (E_first)\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy just above the ground state. We create this by moving one particle from an occupied level to the lowest available unoccupied level.\n1.  **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n2.  **Lowest Excitation:** The smallest energy jump involves moving a particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n3.  **New Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n4.  **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    E_first = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\n    E_first = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E)\n    E_first = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n#### c) Second Excited State Energy (E_second)\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to find the next possible energy jump from the ground state.\nLet's consider the possible excitations from the ground state configuration and find their energies:\n*   **Excitation 1 (First Excited State):** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3. Total Energy = 15E. (Already calculated)\n*   **Excitation 2:** Move one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\n    *   Energy = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**\n*   **Excitation 3:** Move two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**\n*   **Excitation 4:** Move one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state) and the next lowest is **18E**. Therefore, the second excited state has an energy of 18E.\n\n### 4. Summary and Final Answer\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThese values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
