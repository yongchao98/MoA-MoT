    "*   **Analysis of Reactants**\n    1.  **((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene**: This is an aryl ether. The structure can be broken down as follows: a phenyl group (from benzene) is attached to an oxygen atom (-oxy-). This oxygen is attached to a (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl) group. Let's draw this alkyl group:\n        *   \"but-\" indicates a 4-carbon chain.\n        *   \"-3-en\" indicates a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n        *   \"-1-yl\" indicates that the attachment point to the oxygen is at carbon 1.\n        *   \"2,2-dimethyl\" indicates two methyl groups on carbon 2.\n        *   So the full structure is: Phenyl-O-CH₂(C1)-C(CH₃)₂(C2)-CH(C3)=CH₂(C4).\n    2.  **Hydrogen Bromide (HBr)**: This is a strong acid and a source of an electrophile (H⁺) and a nucleophile (Br⁻).\n\n*   **Plausible Reaction Mechanism**\n    The most likely reaction to occur is an electrophilic addition of H⁺ from HBr to the alkene (C=C) double bond in the side chain. The phenyl ether part of the molecule contains a stable aromatic ring and an ether linkage that is relatively unreactive to HBr at temperatures where addition to an alkene occurs (ether cleavage requires harsher conditions or specific substrates).\n\n    **Step 1: Protonation of the Alkene**\n    According to Markovnikov's rule, the proton (H⁺) will add to the carbon of the double bond that has more hydrogen atoms, which is C4 (the CH₂ group). This addition forms the more stable carbocation, a secondary carbocation at C3.\n\n    Reactant + H⁺ → Intermediate A (Secondary Carbocation)\n    Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH=CH₂ + H⁺ → Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-C⁺H-CH₃\n\n    **Step 2: Fate of the Carbocation**\n    This secondary carbocation (Intermediate A) is an electrophile. The molecule also contains a potent nucleophile: the electron-rich benzene ring (activated by the -OR group, which is an ortho,para-director). This allows for an intramolecular reaction. However, the carbocation can also rearrange to an even more stable carbocation. This leads to two competing pathways, which explains the formation of two products.\n\n    **Pathway 1: Cyclization of the Secondary Carbocation**\n    The ortho position of the phenyl ring can attack the secondary carbocation at C3. This is an intramolecular Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   Let's count the atoms that will form the new ring: C(ortho)-C(3)-C(2)-C(1)-O-C(ipso). This is a 6-membered ring.\n    *   The resulting heterocyclic system is a chromane.\n    *   Let's determine the substituents on the chromane ring. The standard chromane numbering starts with O=1. The chain carbons become C2, C3, and C4.\n        *   The original C1 (a -CH₂-) is now C2 of the chromane ring.\n        *   The original C2 (with two methyl groups) is now C3.\n        *   The original C3 (with the carbocation, which also has a methyl group attached after protonation) is now C4.\n    *   So, the product has two methyl groups at C3 and one methyl group at C4. The name is **3,3,4-trimethylchromane**. This is the first product listed in option B.\n\n    **Pathway 2: Rearrangement followed by Cyclization**\n    The secondary carbocation (Intermediate A) can undergo a 1,2-hydride or 1,2-alkyl shift to form a more stable carbocation. In this case, a 1,2-methyl shift occurs from C2 to C3.\n    *   Intermediate A → Intermediate B (Tertiary Carbocation)\n        Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-C⁺H-CH₃ → Ph-O-CH₂-C⁺(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)₂\n    *   Now, we have a more stable tertiary carbocation (Intermediate B) at C2.\n    *   The ortho position of the phenyl ring can now attack this new electrophilic center at C2.\n    *   Let's count the atoms for this ring formation: C(ortho)-C(2)-C(1)-O-C(ipso). This is a 5-membered ring.\n    *   The resulting heterocyclic system is a 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran.\n    *   Let's determine the substituents. Standard numbering has O=1.\n        *   The original C1 (-CH₂-) becomes C2 of the ring.\n        *   The original C2 becomes C3. What is attached to this carbon? It had one methyl group left and gained an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂) during the rearrangement.\n    *   So, the product has a methyl group and an isopropyl group at position 3. The name is **3-methyl-3-isopropyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran**. This matches the second product listed in option B.\n\n*   **Evaluation of Other Options**\n    *   **A)** (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene is an anti-Markovnikov addition product, which is not expected with HBr unless peroxides are present. ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene would be an elimination product from the rearranged carbocation, which is plausible, but the combination with an anti-Markovnikov product is unlikely.\n    *   **C)** This option lists the Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov addition products of HBr across the double bond without any cyclization. While the Markovnikov product (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene is plausible, the anti-Markovnikov product is not. Also, this ignores the highly favorable intramolecular cyclization reaction.\n    *   **D)** These products would require cleavage of the ether bond and alkylation of the resulting phenol with a saturated alkyl group, which is not a reaction that would occur under these conditions. HBr adds to double bonds; it doesn't reduce them.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    The most chemically sound explanation for the formation of two products is the initial formation of a secondary carbocation, followed by two competing intramolecular Friedel-Crafts alkylation reactions: one from the initial secondary carbocation to form a 6-membered ring, and another from a rearranged, more stable tertiary carbocation to form a 5-membered ring. This corresponds exactly to the two products listed in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
