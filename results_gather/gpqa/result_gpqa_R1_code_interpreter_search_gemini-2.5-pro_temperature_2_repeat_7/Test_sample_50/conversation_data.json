    "This problem can be solved using the method of images. This technique simplifies the problem of a charge near a conductor by replacing the conductor with a fictional \"image charge\" that, along with the original charge, satisfies the boundary conditions of the original problem.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Boundary Conditions:**\n    *   We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is constant and equal to zero (V = 0). This is our key boundary condition.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    *   The goal is to find a configuration of point charges (without the sphere) that produces the same electric field *outside* the sphere's original volume and satisfies the V = 0 boundary condition on the spherical surface of radius `R`.\n    *   We replace the grounded sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` located at a distance `d'` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (`q'`) and its Location (`d'`):**\n    *   Let the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is at `z = d`. The image charge `q'` will be at `z = d'`.\n    *   The potential at any point `P` on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) must be zero. The potential at `P` is the sum of the potentials from `q` and `q'`.\n    *   For this to be true for all points on the sphere, it can be shown that the image charge and its position must be:\n        *   **Location:** `d' = R² / d` (Note that since `d > R`, we have `d' < R`, so the image charge is inside the sphere).\n        *   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R / d)` (The image charge has the opposite sign to the original charge).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    *   The potential energy of the original system (charge `q` and the grounded sphere) is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.\n    *   As the charge `q` is brought from infinity, the induced charges on the sphere exert an attractive force on it. The potential energy of the system is the work done by the field (or the negative of the work done by an external agent).\n    *   A straightforward way to calculate this energy `U` is to use the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by all *other* charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere).\n    *   By the method of images, the potential created by the induced surface charges is identical to the potential created by the single image charge `q'`.\n    *   So, `V_induced` at the position of `q` (at distance `d` from the center) is simply the potential created by `q'` (at distance `d'` from the center).\n        *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - d'`.\n        *   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - d')`\n\n5.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `d'` into the formula for `V_induced`:\n        *   `d - d' = d - R²/d = (d² - R²) / d`\n        *   `q' = -qR/d`\n    *   `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²) / d)`\n    *   `V_induced = -k * qR / (d² - R²) `\n    *   Now, calculate the potential energy `U`:\n        *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n        *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d² - R²)]`\n        *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated expression is `U = - (1/2) * kq² * R / (d² - R²)`.\n    *   This matches option (D).\n\n*Self-Correction/Alternative Check:* The interaction energy of the image system (`q` and `q'`) is `U_image = kqq' / (d-d') = -kq²R / (d²-R²)`. The potential energy of the charge-conductor system is known to be half of this interaction energy, `U = (1/2)U_image`, which gives the same result. The reason for the factor of 1/2 is that the energy is stored in the electric field, which only exists in the region *outside* the sphere (`r > R`), whereas the field for the two-charge image system exists everywhere.\n\nFinal calculation confirms the result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
