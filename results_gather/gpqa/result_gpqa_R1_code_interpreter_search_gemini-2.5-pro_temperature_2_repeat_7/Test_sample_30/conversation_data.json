    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the electrophilic nitration of toluene.\n*   **Reactant:** Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃). The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho, para-directing and activating group.\n*   **Reagents:** A mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) generates the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), which is the electrophile.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction yields a mixture of *o*-nitrotoluene and *p*-nitrotoluene. Due to less steric hindrance, the *para* isomer (*p*-nitrotoluene or 4-nitrotoluene) is the major product and is typically the one carried forward in a multi-step synthesis.\n\n    *Product 1*: *p*-nitrotoluene\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (*p*-nitrotoluene) is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is an oxidation reaction.\n*   **Reactant:** *p*-nitrotoluene.\n*   **Reagents:** Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). MnO₂ is an oxidizing agent, and its power is enhanced in an acidic medium. While MnO₂ is often used for the selective oxidation of benzylic alcohols to aldehydes, under these conditions (with acid, on a methyl group), it can oxidize the methyl group. The extent of oxidation could lead to either an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid.\n*   To decide which product is formed, we must consider the next step. Let's explore both possibilities.\n    *   **Possibility A:** Oxidation to a carboxylic acid, forming *p*-nitrobenzoic acid.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Partial oxidation to an aldehyde, forming *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n*   Let's analyze Step 3 to determine which possibility is correct.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide.**\nThis reaction is a base-catalyzed reaction involving acetone. The base (NaOH) will deprotonate acetone to form its enolate (`⁻CH₂COCH₃`), which is a potent nucleophile.\n\n*   **Analysis of Possibility A (if Product 2 is *p*-nitrobenzoic acid):**\n    The reagents are *p*-nitrobenzoic acid, acetone, and NaOH. The first thing to happen would be an acid-base reaction between the carboxylic acid and NaOH to form sodium *p*-nitrobenzoate. The reaction of this salt with acetone enolate is not a common, standard organic reaction. It could potentially lead to a Meisenheimer-Janovsky complex, but this usually requires stronger activation (e.g., two nitro groups) and the resulting complex would have very low symmetry (C₁), which is not among the options. Thus, this pathway is unlikely.\n\n*   **Analysis of Possibility B (if Product 2 is *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde):**\n    The reagents are *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde, acetone, and NaOH. This is a classic **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**. *p*-Nitrobenzaldehyde has no α-hydrogens and thus cannot self-condense. Acetone has α-hydrogens and forms an enolate. The acetone enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. The initial aldol addition product then readily undergoes dehydration (elimination of water) under basic conditions to form a stable, conjugated system.\n    1.  Addition: `p-NO₂-C₆H₄-CHO + ⁻CH₂COCH₃ → p-NO₂-C₆H₄-CH(O⁻)-CH₂COCH₃`\n    2.  Dehydration: The intermediate is protonated and then loses water to form the α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The *trans* (E) isomer is the thermodynamically more stable and major product.\n\n    *Product 3 Structure*: `O₂N−C₆H₄−CH=CH−C(=O)−CH₃`\n\n**Determination of the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n\nNow we need to find the point group of (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n1.  **Structure and Conformation:** The molecule has an extended π-conjugated system (`O₂N-Aryl-CH=CH-C=O`). To maximize orbital overlap, this entire backbone prefers to be planar. Let's assume the heavy atoms of this framework lie in a single plane.\n2.  **Symmetry Elements:** We check for the presence of symmetry elements.\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    *   **Proper Rotation Axis (Cₙ, n>1):** There is no rotational axis. Rotating the molecule by 180° (C₂) or any other angle does not leave it unchanged, as one end has a 4-nitrophenyl group and the other has an acetyl group.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** There is no center of inversion. For example, inverting the nitrogen atom through any point in the molecule does not land on another nitrogen atom.\n    *   **Plane of Reflection (σ):** If we consider the plane that contains the planar heavy-atom backbone (`C₆H₄-CH=CH-C=O`), this plane acts as a mirror plane. The methyl group (-CH₃) attached to the carbonyl can adopt a conformation where one of its hydrogen atoms lies in this plane, and the other two are located symmetrically above and below the plane. Similarly, the two oxygen atoms of the nitro group are symmetric with respect to this plane. Thus, the molecule possesses one plane of symmetry (σ).\n3.  **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of reflection (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) Cₛ\nB) D₂h\nC) C₃\nD) C₂h\n\nThe correct point group is Cₛ.\n\n<<<A>>>"
