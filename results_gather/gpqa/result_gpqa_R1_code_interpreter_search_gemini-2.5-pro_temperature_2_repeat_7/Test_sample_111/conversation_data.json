    "This is a quantum mechanics problem involving a two-level system (spin-1/2 electron). Here's a systematic breakdown of the solution.\n\n### 1. Normalize the State Vector |alpha>\n\nThe given state is |alpha> ∝ (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>. We can write it as:\n|alpha> = C * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]\n\nTo normalize it, the inner product <alpha|alpha> must equal 1. In the |up>, |down> basis, where |up> = [1, 0]^T and |down> = [0, 1]^T, the state vector can be written as:\n|alpha> = C * [1+i, 2-i]^T\n\nThe corresponding bra vector is <alpha| = C* * [1-i, 2+i].\n\n<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [1-i, 2+i] * [1+i, 2-i]^T = 1\n|C|^2 * [(1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)] = 1\n|C|^2 * [(1 - i²) + (4 - i²)] = 1\n|C|^2 * [(1 + 1) + (4 + 1)] = 1\n|C|^2 * (2 + 5) = 1\n7 * |C|^2 = 1  => |C| = 1/√7\n\nSo, the normalized state vector is:\n|alpha> = (1/√7) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]\n\n### 2. Determine the Matrix Representation of Operator A\n\nThe problem states that the elements Aij of the operator A are:\n*   Aij = hbar/2 if i ≠ j\n*   Aij = 0 if i = j\n\nFor a two-level system (i, j = 1, 2), the matrix is:\nA = [[A11, A12], [A21, A22]] = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]\nThis can be written as:\nA = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\nThis operator is proportional to the Pauli-X matrix (A = (hbar/2) * σ_x).\n\n### 3. Find Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of A\n\nTo find the probabilities of measurement, we need to find the eigenstates of the operator A. First, we find the eigenvalues (λ) by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.\ndet([[ -λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2,  -λ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)² = 0\nλ² - (hbar/2)² = 0\nλ = ± hbar/2\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ₁ = +hbar/2 and λ₂ = -hbar/2.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors (eigenstates):\n*   **For λ₁ = +hbar/2:**\n    (A - λ₁I)|v₁> = 0\n    [[-hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -hbar/2]] * [x, y]^T = 0\n    This gives the equation -x + y = 0, so x = y.\n    The eigenvector is proportional to [1, 1]^T.\n    Normalizing it, we get the first eigenstate: |v₁> = (1/√2) * [1, 1]^T = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>).\n\n*   **For λ₂ = -hbar/2:**\n    (A - λ₂I)|v₂> = 0\n    [[hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, hbar/2]] * [x, y]^T = 0\n    This gives the equation x + y = 0, so x = -y.\n    The eigenvector is proportional to [1, -1]^T.\n    Normalizing it, we get the second eigenstate: |v₂> = (1/√2) * [1, -1]^T = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>).\n\n### 4. Calculate the Measurement Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the system, initially in state |alpha>, in an eigenstate |v_i> is given by P(λ_i) = |<v_i|alpha>|².\n\n*   **Probability for λ₁ = +hbar/2 (state |v₁>):**\n    P(λ₁) = |<v₁|alpha>|²\n    <v₁|alpha> = [ (1/√2) * (<up| + <down|) ] * [ (1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>) ]\n    = (1/√14) * [ (1)(1+i) + (1)(2-i) ]\n    = (1/√14) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/√14\n    P(λ₁) = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643\n\n*   **Probability for λ₂ = -hbar/2 (state |v₂>):**\n    P(λ₂) = |<v₂|alpha>|²\n    <v₂|alpha> = [ (1/√2) * (<up| - <down|) ] * [ (1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>) ]\n    = (1/√14) * [ (1)(1+i) - (1)(2-i) ]\n    = (1/√14) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/√14\n    P(λ₂) = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. Note that they sum to 1 (9/14 + 5/14 = 1).\n\n### 5. Calculate the Average (Expectation) Value of A\n\nThe average value of the operator A, denoted <A>, can be calculated in two ways.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities**\n    <A> = Σᵢ P(λᵢ) * λᵢ\n    <A> = P(λ₁)λ₁ + P(λ₂)λ₂\n    <A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)\n    <A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the formula <A> = <alpha|A|alpha>**\n    A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]^T\n    = (hbar/(2√7)) * [2-i, 1+i]^T\n    <A> = <alpha|(A|alpha>)\n    = [ (1/√7) * [1-i, 2+i] ] * [ (hbar/(2√7)) * [2-i, 1+i]^T ]\n    = (hbar/14) * [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]\n    = (hbar/14) * [ (2 - 3i + i²) + (2 + 3i + i²) ]\n    = (hbar/14) * [ (2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1) ]\n    = (hbar/14) * [ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) ]\n    = (hbar/14) * 2 = hbar/7\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are **0.64** and **0.36** (approximately), and the average value is **hbar/7**. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
