    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the operators:**\n    The problem provides the components of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ along the x, y, and z axes. These are proportional to the Pauli spin matrices:\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n    This operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator, usually denoted as $\\vec{S}$.\n\n2.  **Define the direction vector:**\n    We need to find the operator along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane. A unit vector in the x-z plane can be represented in spherical coordinates with the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$. The polar angle $\\theta$ is the angle with the positive z-axis.\n    The unit vector $\\vec{n}$ is therefore:\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$ with $\\phi=0$.\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n3.  **Construct the operator along the direction $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The operator for spin along the direction $\\vec{n}$, denoted as $P_{\\vec{n}}$, is given by the dot product $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$:\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z$\n    Substituting the components of $\\vec{n}$ and the operators:\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = (\\sin\\theta) P_x + (0) P_y + (\\cos\\theta) P_z$\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = (\\sin\\theta) \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x\\right) + (\\cos\\theta) \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z\\right)$\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n    Now, let's write this in matrix form:\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the eigenvalue equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. Let the eigenvector be represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    We can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the eigenvector components:**\n    This matrix equation gives a system of two linear equations:\n    (i) $a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = a$\n    (ii) $a\\sin\\theta - b\\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's solve for the ratio $b/a$ using the first equation:\n    $b\\sin\\theta = a - a\\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n    Using the half-angle trigonometric identities: $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$.\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n    This means the components $a$ and $b$ are proportional to $\\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin(\\theta/2)$ respectively. We can write the unnormalized eigenvector as:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = k \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    for some normalization constant $k$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the eigenvector:**\n    The normalization condition requires that the inner product of the state with itself is 1, i.e., $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n    $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = \\left( k^* \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) & \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( k \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = |k|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2))$\n    Using the identity $\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x) = 1$:\n    $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |k|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |k|^2 = 1$\n    We can choose the simplest phase for the constant, $k=1$.\n    Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This corresponds to option D."
