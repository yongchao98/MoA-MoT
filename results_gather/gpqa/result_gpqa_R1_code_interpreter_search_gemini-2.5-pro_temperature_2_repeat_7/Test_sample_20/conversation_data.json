    "*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n    Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where structural isomers, called tautomers, can rapidly interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n    1.  **Benzoquinone (1,4-Benzoquinone):**\n        *   The structure consists of a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups (C=O) at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) at positions 2-3 and 5-6.\n        *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the α-carbons) are the carbons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n        *   These α-carbons are part of the C=C double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them.\n        *   Since there are no α-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n        *   The hydrogen atoms on these CH₂ groups are α-hydrogens (they are adjacent to carbonyl groups). In fact, each of these carbons is alpha to two carbonyl groups.\n        *   The presence of these acidic α-hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n        *   This enol form is an aromatic compound, which makes it particularly stable. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exists predominantly in its tautomeric enol form and strongly exhibits tautomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n    Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon bearing the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n            1.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            2.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n        *   The molecule is chiral and will exist as a pair of enantiomers (optical isomers).\n\n    2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   The structure is the trans isomer of CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n        *   The molecule is planar due to the sp² hybridization of the double-bonded carbons.\n        *   It contains a center of symmetry (an inversion center) and a plane of symmetry.\n        *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule (no carbon is bonded to four different groups).\n        *   Since the molecule is achiral, it does not show optical isomerism. (It does show geometric isomerism with its cis counterpart, dimethyl maleate).\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Decision**\n    *   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n    This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
