    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the fundamental quantities:**\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to a star. Mathematically, `plx = 1/d` (assuming parallax is measured in arcseconds and distance in parsecs). This implies `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Uniform Star Distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, ρ (number of stars per unit volume), is a constant.\n\n2.  **Calculate the number of stars up to a certain distance:**\n    *   Let's find the total number of stars, `N(<d)`, within a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer.\n    *   The volume of a sphere of radius `d` is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the density ρ is constant, the number of stars within this volume is `N(<d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`.\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax:**\n    *   A star at distance `d` has a parallax `plx = 1/d`. Stars that are closer than `d` have larger parallaxes (`> 1/d`).\n    *   Therefore, the number of stars with a parallax *greater* than a certain value `plx` is equivalent to the number of stars within a distance `d = 1/plx`. Let's call this `N(>plx)`.\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx` into the equation for `N(<d)`:\n        `N(>plx) = ρ * (4/3)π * (1/plx)³ = (4/3)πρ * (1/plx³)`.\n\n4.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for how the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* changes with `plx`. This is the derivative of the number of stars with respect to parallax. Let's denote this quantity as `n(plx)`.\n    *   `n(plx)` tells us the density of stars at a specific parallax value. To find it, we differentiate the cumulative number `N(>plx)` with respect to `plx`.\n        `n(plx) = | d(N(>plx)) / d(plx) |`\n        We use the absolute value because the number of stars must be a positive quantity, and the derivative will be negative (since `N(>plx)` decreases as `plx` increases).\n\n5.  **Perform the differentiation:**\n    *   `n(plx) = | d/d(plx) [ (4/3)πρ * plx⁻³ ] |`\n    *   Using the power rule for differentiation (`d/dx (xⁿ) = nxⁿ⁻¹`):\n        `n(plx) = | (4/3)πρ * (-3 * plx⁻⁴) |`\n        `n(plx) = | -4πρ * plx⁻⁴ |`\n        `n(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n6.  **Determine the proportionality:**\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the expression shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax, `n(plx)`, is directly proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   `n(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Match with the given options:**\n    *   A) ~ 1/plx^3\n    *   B) ~ 1/plx^1\n    *   C) ~ 1/plx^2\n    *   D) ~ 1/plx^4\n    The derived relationship matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
