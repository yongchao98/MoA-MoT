    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get an idea of the rings and/or double/triple bonds in the molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 for the ring and 3 for the double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹** and **3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and a tertiary amine would show none in this region.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is in the carbonyl stretching region. This frequency is typical for an ester (R-CO-O-R'). Aldehydes and ketones are usually at a similar frequency, but amides are typically at a lower frequency (around 1650-1680 cm⁻¹).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, appearing as a triplet. This is a classic pattern for a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, appearing as a quartet. This corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) that is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-).\n    *   *Putting these two together:* The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm strongly indicate the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is significantly downfield, which means the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen, as in an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3). Given the high shift, an ester linkage is very likely.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2), which aligns perfectly with the IR data. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding and rapid exchange.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shifts (7.0 ppm vs. 8.0 ppm) indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting the ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm). The amino group (-NH2) is a strong electron-donating group, and the ester group (-COOR) is a strong electron-withdrawing group.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This molecule has a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine (-NH2), and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). All fragments identified from the spectra are present in this structure. The amino group (electron-donating) and ester group (electron-withdrawing) are para to each other, which would produce the observed two-doublet pattern in the aromatic region. This structure perfectly matches all data.\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester, not an ethyl ester. The ethyl group is part of the propionyl side (CH3CH2CO-). The -CH2- protons of the propionyl group would be next to a carbonyl and appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This compound is a secondary amide (-NH-), not a primary amine (-NH2), which contradicts the IR (two N-H bands) and NMR (2H broad singlet) data.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This compound is a primary amide, not an ester, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. Furthermore, it is 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe data from the molecular formula, IR, and 1H NMR spectra all point unequivocally to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
