    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:**\n    The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Let's break down the IUPAC name to draw its structure.\n    *   \"nona\": The main carbon chain has 9 carbons.\n    *   \"-2,6-diene\": There are two double bonds in the main chain, starting at carbon 2 and carbon 6.\n    *   \"5-butyl\": A butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 5 of the main chain.\n\n    The structure can be written as:\n    CH₃(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-CH₂(4)-CH(5)(C₄H₉)-CH(6)=CH(7)-CH₂(8)-CH₃(9)\n\n    Let's check the valencies of each carbon to ensure the structure is correct.\n    *   C1: CH₃- (ok)\n    *   C2: -CH= (ok)\n    *   C3: =CH- (ok)\n    *   C4: -CH₂- (ok)\n    *   C5: This carbon is bonded to C4, C6, a hydrogen, and the butyl group. So, -CH(C₄H₉)- (ok).\n    *   C6: =CH- (ok)\n    *   C7: =CH- (ok)\n    *   C8: -CH₂- (ok)\n    *   C9: -CH₃ (ok)\n\n    The structure is confirmed. The group at C7 is an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The group at C1 is a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction Type:**\n    The reactant is a diene, and the condition is heating. This strongly suggests a pericyclic reaction. Since there is no conjugated system for an electrocyclization and no heteroatoms for a reaction like the Claisen rearrangement, the most likely reaction is a **Cope rearrangement**.\n    A Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement that occurs in hexa-1,5-diene systems. The general scheme is:\n    C(1)=C(2)-C(3)-C(4)-C(5)=C(6)  →  C(1)-C(2)=C(3)-C(4)=C(5)-C(6) (with a new bond between C1 and C6, and the old C3-C4 bond broken).\n\n3.  **Apply the Cope Rearrangement to the Reactant:**\n    We need to identify the hexa-1,5-diene system within 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Let's look at the backbone from C2 to C7:\n    **C(2)=C(3)-C(4)-C(5)-C(6)=C(7)**\n    This is a 6-carbon chain segment that fits the hexa-1,5-diene pattern.\n    *   C2 maps to C1' in the general scheme.\n    *   C3 maps to C2'.\n    *   C4 maps to C3'.\n    *   C5 maps to C4'.\n    *   C6 maps to C5'.\n    *   C7 maps to C6'.\n\n    According to the Cope rearrangement mechanism:\n    *   The sigma bond between C3' and C4' breaks. This corresponds to the **C4-C5 bond** in the original molecule.\n    *   A new sigma bond forms between C1' and C6'. This corresponds to a new bond between **C2 and C7**.\n    *   The pi bond at C1'=C2' (original C2=C3) moves to C2'=C3' (new bond at **C3=C4**).\n    *   The pi bond at C5'=C6' (original C6=C7) moves to C4'=C5' (new bond at **C5=C6**).\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure of the Product:**\n    Let's assemble the product based on the new connectivity. We list the groups attached to each carbon in the rearranging framework (C2 to C7):\n    *   C2: Attached to a methyl group (C1) and H.\n    *   C3: Attached to H.\n    *   C4: Attached to two H atoms.\n    *   C5: Attached to a butyl group (Bu) and H.\n    *   C6: Attached to H.\n    *   C7: Attached to an ethyl group (Et, from C8-C9) and H.\n\n    Let's write out the new molecule by connecting the atoms with their new bonds:\n    *   A bond forms between C2 and C7.\n    *   The chain is broken between C4 and C5.\n    *   New double bonds are at C3=C4 and C5=C6.\n\n    Let's trace the connectivity to draw the final product:\n    The CH₃ group (C1) is attached to C2. C2 is now attached to C7 and C3.\n    C3 is double bonded to C4, so this fragment is CH₃-CH(from C2)-CH(from C3)=CH₂(from C4).\n    The butyl group is attached to C5. C5 is double bonded to C6. The hydrogen originally on C5 is still there. So this fragment is (C₄H₉)(H)C(from C5)=CH(from C6).\n    C6 is attached to C7. The ethyl group is on C7. So this fragment is -(Et)CH(from C7)-CH=C(Bu)(H).\n    Connecting these two fragments via the new C2-C7 bond:\n    \n            CH₃\n             |\n    CH₂=CH - CH(from C2) - CH(from C7) - CH(from C6)=C(H)(C₄H₉)\n                               |\n                               CH₂CH₃\n\n5.  **Name the Product using IUPAC Nomenclature:**\n    Now we must find the longest carbon chain in the product molecule that contains the maximum number of double bonds.\n    *   The chain must contain both double bonds (the C=C originating from C3=C4 and the one from C5=C6).\n    *   Let's trace the possible chains starting from the ends:\n        *   End 1: CH₂= group.\n        *   End 2: The methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   End 3: The ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n        *   End 4: The butyl group (-C₄H₉).\n    *   The longest chain that contains both double bonds starts at the CH₂= end and continues through the molecule to the end of the butyl group.\n    \n    Let's number this chain. The IUPAC rule is to number the chain to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Numbering from the CH₂= end:\n    \n            CH₃   CH₂CH₃      H   -CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃ (Butyl)\n            |      |          |  /\n    CH₂(1)=CH(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH(5)=C(6)\n    \n        The chain continues into the butyl group: C(6)-C(7)-C(8)-C(9)-C(10).\n    *   **Parent Chain:** The chain has 10 carbons, so it is a **deca-** chain. With two double bonds, it is a **decadiene**.\n    *   **Locants of double bonds:** The double bonds start at C1 and C5. So, it is a **deca-1,5-diene**.\n    *   **Substituents:**\n        *   At C3, there is a **methyl** group.\n        *   At C4, there is an **ethyl** group.\n    *   **Final Name:** We list the substituents alphabetically. So, the full name is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene (Incorrect chain length and structure)\n    B) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene (Incorrect locants)\n    C) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene (Matches our derived name)\n    D) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene (Same as B)\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
