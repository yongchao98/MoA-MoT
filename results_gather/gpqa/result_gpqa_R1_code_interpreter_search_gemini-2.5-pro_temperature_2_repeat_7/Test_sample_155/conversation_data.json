    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the chemical reactions.**\n\nThe reaction sequence involves two steps:\n1.  **Epoxidation:** Treatment with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA). This reagent adds a single oxygen atom across the double bond to form an epoxide. This is a **syn-addition**, meaning the oxygen adds to one face of the alkene.\n2.  **Epoxide Ring Opening:** Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). The acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a good leaving group. A water molecule then acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the back side (S_N2-like). This is an **anti-addition** of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n\nThe overall transformation is an **anti-dihydroxylation** of an alkene.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stereochemistry of the products for Reaction 1.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene.\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a *trans*-alkene results in a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral, having an internal plane of symmetry, and has stereocenters with opposite configurations (e.g., R,S).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral meso compound. Let's call it compound **M**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the stereochemistry of the products for Reaction 2.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene.\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images and have opposite configurations at all stereocenters (e.g., R,R and S,S).\n*   **Products of Reaction 2:** A 1:1 mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (let's call it **RR**) and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (let's call it **SS**).\n\n**Step 4: Characterize the final combined mixture.**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different chemical compounds (stereoisomers):\n1.  **M**: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (the meso compound)\n2.  **RR**: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n3.  **SS**: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\nLet's examine the relationship between these stereoisomers:\n*   **RR** and **SS** are enantiomers.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of both **RR** and **SS**. (Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n**Step 5: Predict the outcome of the standard (achiral) HPLC analysis.**\n\n*   Standard HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like **RR** and **SS**) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by standard HPLC and will elute at the same time, appearing as a **single peak**.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like **M** vs. the **RR/SS** pair) have different physical properties. They will have different interactions with the HPLC column and will be separated into **different peaks**.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n    *   One peak for the racemic mixture of **RR** and **SS**.\n    *   A second, distinct peak for the meso compound **M**.\n*   **Conclusion for standard HPLC: 2 peaks.**\n\n**Step 6: Predict the outcome of the chiral HPLC analysis.**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers. It separates compounds based on the different stabilities of the transient diastereomeric complexes they form with the stationary phase.\n*   **Enantiomers** (**RR** and **SS**) will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n*   The meso compound **M** is a diastereomer of **RR** and **SS**. It will also have a unique interaction with the chiral stationary phase and will elute at a time different from both **RR** and **SS**, appearing as its own **single peak**. The question states the resolution is as high as theoretically possible, meaning there will be no accidental co-elution of diastereomers.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n    *   One peak for **RR**.\n    *   A second peak for **SS**.\n    *   A third peak for **M**.\n*   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC: 3 peaks.**\n\n**Step 7: Match the findings with the given options.**\n\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
