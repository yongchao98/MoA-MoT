    "The user wants to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the energy it receives from its star. This energy decreases with the square of the distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature shows that $T_{eq}$ is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (`a`) of its orbit, assuming other factors like stellar luminosity and planet albedo are constant. The problem states the planets have the same albedo, and they orbit the same star.\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n2.  **Formulate the Ratio of Temperatures:**\n    Based on the relationship above, the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 ($T_{eq4}$) to that of Planet_2 ($T_{eq2}$) can be written as:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{a_4}}{1/\\sqrt{a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}}$\n    where $a_2$ and $a_4$ are the semi-major axes of Planet_2 and Planet_4, respectively.\n\n3.  **Use Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law connects a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis (a). The law states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    We can rearrange this to express the semi-major axis in terms of the period:\n    $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n4.  **Substitute Kepler's Law into the Temperature Ratio:**\n    Now, we can express the ratio of the semi-major axes ($\\frac{a_2}{a_4}$) in terms of the ratio of their orbital periods ($\\frac{P_2}{P_4}$):\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}$\n    Substituting this into our temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}}$\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    We can simplify the exponents:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}\\right)^{1/2} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{(2/3) \\times (1/2)} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    So, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is the cube root of the ratio of their orbital periods.\n\n6.  **Extract Data and Calculate:**\n    The problem gives the orbital period ratios as $P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5$.\n    From this, we find the ratio of the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$\n    Now we calculate the final value:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nTo get a precise numerical answer, I will use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4 is P2 / P4.\n# From the given ratio P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, we get:\n# P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5\n\nperiod_ratio_p2_p4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The relationship between equilibrium temperature (T_eq) and orbital period (P) is derived\n# from T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(a) and Kepler's Third Law (a ∝ P^(2/3)).\n# This gives T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).\n\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio_p2_p4**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n\n**Execution Output:**\n`0.8298265333662435`\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.8298. Rounding this to two decimal places gives 0.83. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
