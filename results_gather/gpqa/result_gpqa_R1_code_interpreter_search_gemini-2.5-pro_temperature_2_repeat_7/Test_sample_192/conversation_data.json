    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   The core information given is how the number of stars (`N`) is distributed with respect to parallax (`plx`). The problem states this relationship is: `Number of stars ∝ 1/plx⁵`.\n    *   This is a distribution function. It tells us how many stars we find in a small interval of parallax. Mathematically, we can write this as `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`, where `dN` is the number of stars in a small parallax interval `d(plx)`.\n    *   The question asks for a similar distribution, but with respect to distance (`r`). In other words, how does the number of stars change per unit range of distance? This is asking for the functional form of `dN/dr`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Relationship:**\n    *   The crucial link between the given information (in terms of parallax) and the desired answer (in terms of distance) is the fundamental astronomical relationship between distance and parallax.\n    *   Distance `r` is the inverse of parallax `plx`.\n    *   `r = 1/plx`  or `plx = 1/r`\n\n3.  **Formulate a Mathematical Strategy:**\n    *   I need to transform the distribution from parallax-space to distance-space. This is a classic \"change of variables\" problem in calculus.\n    *   The chain rule is the tool for this. It states:\n        `dN/dr = (dN / d(plx)) * (d(plx) / dr)`\n    *   This formula will allow me to find `dN/dr` using the `dN/d(plx)` that was given.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   **Step 1: Start with the given information.**\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n    *   **Step 2: Find the derivative `d(plx)/dr`.**\n        *   Since `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`\n        *   Using the power rule for derivatives: `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n        *   When dealing with number densities and distributions, we are interested in the magnitude of the change, not the direction (the negative sign just indicates that as one variable increases, the other decreases). So, we'll use the absolute value: `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Apply the chain rule.**\n        `dN/dr ∝ |(dN / d(plx)) * (d(plx) / dr)|`\n        `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n    *   **Step 4: Express everything in terms of the desired variable, `r`.**\n        *   Right now, the expression has both `plx` and `r`. I need to substitute the relationship `plx = 1/r` into the `plx` term.\n        *   `plx⁻⁵ = (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n\n    *   **Step 5: Substitute this back into the expression for `dN/dr`.**\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n    *   **Step 6: Simplify the expression.**\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n5.  **Final Check and Conclusion:**\n    *   The calculation shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) is proportional to `r³`.\n    *   This matches option D in the multiple-choice list.\n\nThis step-by-step process ensures all parts of the problem are addressed correctly, using the right physical and mathematical principles to transform the given information into the required answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
