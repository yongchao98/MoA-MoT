    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, so its formula is CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%, which is equivalent to 0.1428.\n    *   The mass fraction of H can be calculated as `Mass_H / Total_Mass = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. For simplicity, using integer masses (H=1, C=12), the formula is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`\n    *   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons:\n        *   **Alkanes (CnH2n+2):** %H = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). As n increases, this value approaches 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. For n=6 (hexane, C6H14), %H = 14 / (14*6+2) = 14/86 ≈ 16.3%. This is not a match.\n        *   **Cycloalkanes (CnH2n):** %H = 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857. This is a perfect match.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states Z is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12). We'll see which one fits the other clues.\n    *   Z does not react further with hydrogen, which is consistent with it being a saturated cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (alkanes, cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n    *   One constituent of Y is the substance Z. So, one liquid in Y is Z (a cycloalkane).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* substance Z. This means the second component of Y, let's call it Y₂, must also convert to Z upon hydrogenation.\n    *   If Y₂ hydrogenates to a cycloalkane Z, it must have the same carbon skeleton as Z and be either unsaturated or aromatic. Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it must be aromatic.\n    *   For an aromatic compound (Y₂) and a cycloalkane (Z) to have the same carbon skeleton that can be interconverted by hydrogenation, the skeleton must be a six-membered ring. This forces Z to be **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and Y₂ to be **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   Let's check this: Cyclohexane is a common solvent. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. Benzene does not react with bromine water without a catalyst. This all fits.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y consists of equimolar amounts of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n    *   The reaction is `Mixture X → Mixture Y` upon heating with Pt.\n    *   This means: `(Components of X) --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)` (in a 1:1 molar ratio).\n    *   This is a disproportionation reaction, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer reaction. One species is dehydrogenated (loses hydrogen, gets \"oxidized\") and another is hydrogenated (gains hydrogen, gets \"reduced\").\n    *   Benzene (C6H6) is the oxidized product (less H than the starting materials).\n    *   Cyclohexane (C6H12) is the reduced product (more H than the starting materials).\n    *   Since mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them X₁ and X₂), and the products are also formed in an equimolar ratio, the simplest reaction stoichiometry is: `X₁ + X₂ → Benzene + Cyclohexane`.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both X₁ and X₂ have a six-carbon skeleton that hydrogenates to cyclohexane's skeleton. So, they must be of the formula C6Hy.\n    *   Our reaction becomes: `C6Hx + C6Hy → C6H6 + C6H12`.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, we can balance the hydrogens: `x + y = 6 + 12 = 18`.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n    *   We need to find two compounds, X₁ (C6Hx) and X₂ (C6Hy), such that `x + y = 18`.\n    *   Properties of X₁ and X₂:\n        *   They are based on a 6-membered ring skeleton.\n        *   They decolorize bromine water, so they must contain C=C double bonds (i.e., they are cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes).\n        *   They do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Let's look for possible candidates:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10):** Contains one double bond, so it decolorizes bromine water. The double bond is not conjugated. This is a possible candidate. Here, the number of hydrogens is 10.\n        *   **Cyclohexadienes (C6H8):** Contain two double bonds.\n            *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene: The double bonds are conjugated. The problem states there are no conjugated bonds, so this is ruled out.\n            *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene:** The double bonds are not conjugated. This is a possible candidate. Here, the number of hydrogens is 8.\n    *   Let's test the combination of X₁ = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and X₂ = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The number of hydrogen atoms are x=10 and y=8. Let's check our hydrogen balance: `x + y = 10 + 8 = 18`. This is a perfect match.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction would be:\n        `C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)`\n        In this reaction, the 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized (loses 2H) to benzene, and the cyclohexene is reduced (gains 2H) to cyclohexane. This is a chemically sound hydrogen transfer reaction.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8)\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
