    "This question asks for the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation for space-charge-limited current (SCLC) is valid. Let's analyze the assumptions behind this equation.\n\nThe Mott-Gurney equation is derived by solving the Poisson's equation and the drift current equation simultaneously, under a specific set of boundary conditions and assumptions.\n\n1.  **Device Type and Carrier Transport**: The SCLC regime described by Mott and Gurney is a phenomenon of unipolar (single-carrier) injection. The model assumes that the current is carried predominantly by one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes), and the contribution from the other type is negligible. Therefore, it must be a **single-carrier device**. This immediately rules out option D, which specifies a two-carrier device.\n\n2.  **Contact Type (Injection)**: For a large amount of charge to be injected into the semiconductor (creating the \"space charge\"), the contact must be able to supply these carriers readily. This type of contact is called an **Ohmic contact**, which is characterized by having **no (or a very low) energy barrier for carrier injection**. A Schottky contact, by contrast, has a built-in potential barrier that would limit the injection of current, making SCLC behavior difficult to achieve. Therefore, an Ohmic contact or, equivalently, a contact with \"no carrier injection barrier\" is required. This rules out option A.\n\n3.  **Presence of Traps**: The original Mott-Gurney law is derived for an ideal insulator or semiconductor, which is assumed to be **trap-free**. If there were trap states within the bandgap, they would capture some of the injected carriers, reducing the density of free carriers available for conduction. The presence of traps significantly alters the J-V characteristics, leading to different regimes not described by the simple Mott-Gurney equation. So, the material must be assumed to be trap-free.\n\n4.  **Current Components (Drift vs. Diffusion)**: The total current density is the sum of the drift current (due to the electric field) and the diffusion current (due to the concentration gradient). The SCLC model assumes that the applied voltage is sufficiently high so that the drift of carriers under the electric field is the dominant transport mechanism. The current contribution from the diffusion of carriers is assumed to be **negligible**. Therefore, we need **negligible diffusion current**, not negligible drift current. The SCLC is fundamentally a drift-driven current. This condition makes option B incorrect, as it states \"negligible drift current\".\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   Incorrect. A Schottky contact limits injection, whereas an Ohmic contact is required for SCLC.\n\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n    *   Incorrect. The current in the SCLC regime is a drift current. Neglecting it is fundamentally wrong.\n\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   **trap-free**: Correct.\n    *   **single-carrier device**: Correct.\n    *   **no carrier injection barrier**: Correct (this is the definition of an ideal Ohmic contact).\n    *   **negligible diffusion current**: Correct.\n    *   This statement accurately captures all the key assumptions.\n\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   Incorrect. The model is for a single-carrier (unipolar) device.\n\nTherefore, statement C is the true and most complete description of the validity conditions for the Mott-Gurney equation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
