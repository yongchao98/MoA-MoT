    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among different energy levels in a system at thermal equilibrium. The assumption that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) allows us to use this equation.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation:**\n    The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state `i` ($N_i$) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state `j` ($N_j$) is given by:\n    $N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp[-(E_i - E_j) / (k * T)]$\n    Where:\n    *   $g_i$ and $g_j$ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the respective energy levels.\n    *   $\\Delta E = E_i - E_j$ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n    *   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Applying to the Two Stars:**\n    We are comparing the same energy levels of iron atoms in two different stars, star_1 and star_2, with effective temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively.\n    *   For star_1: $(N_i / N_j)_1 = (g_i / g_j) * exp[-\\Delta E / (k * T_1)]$\n    *   For star_2: $(N_i / N_j)_2 = (g_i / g_j) * exp[-\\Delta E / (k * T_2)]$\n\n    Note that the energy difference $\\Delta E$ and the statistical weights ($g_i$, $g_j$) are intrinsic properties of the iron atom's energy levels, so they are the same for both stars.\n\n3.  **Using the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of excited atoms to atoms in the lower state is twice as large for star_1 as it is for star_2.\n    $(N_i / N_j)_1 = 2 * (N_i / N_j)_2$\n\n4.  **Formulating the Equation:**\n    Now, we substitute the Boltzmann expressions into this relationship:\n    $(g_i / g_j) * exp[-\\Delta E / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_i / g_j) * exp[-\\Delta E / (k * T_2)]$\n\n    The term for the statistical weights, $(g_i / g_j)$, cancels from both sides:\n    $exp[-\\Delta E / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-\\Delta E / (k * T_2)]$\n\n5.  **Solving for the Temperatures:**\n    To solve this equation, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    $ln(exp[-\\Delta E / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-\\Delta E / (k * T_2)])$\n\n    Using the logarithm properties ($ln(exp(x)) = x$ and $ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)$):\n    $-\\Delta E / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-\\Delta E / (k * T_2)])$\n    $-\\Delta E / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - \\Delta E / (k * T_2)$\n\n    Now, rearrange the equation to solve for $ln(2)$:\n    $ln(2) = \\Delta E / (k * T_2) - \\Delta E / (k * T_1)$\n\n    Factor out the common term, $(\\Delta E / k)$:\n    $ln(2) = (\\Delta E / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)$\n\n    Combine the fractions in the parentheses:\n    $ln(2) = (\\Delta E / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]$\n\n6.  **Substituting the Given Values:**\n    The problem provides the energy difference: $\\Delta E \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J.\n    The Boltzmann constant is a physical constant: $k \\approx 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K.\n\n    The ratio $(\\Delta E / k)$ is therefore:\n    $(\\Delta E / k) = (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} J) / (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} J/K) \\approx 1 K$\n\n    Given the form of the answer choices, it's clear we should approximate this ratio as 1.\n\n    Substituting this value back into our derived equation:\n    $ln(2) = 1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]$\n    $ln(2) = [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]$\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
