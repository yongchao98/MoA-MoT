    "Rationale Breakdown:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction:** The problem involves the equilibrium of the Ca-EDTA complex dissociating into its constituent ions. The reaction is:\n    CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n    where Y⁴⁻ represents the EDTA tetra-anion.\n\n2.  **Define the equilibrium constant:** The formation constant (K_f), also given as KCa-EDTA, describes this equilibrium. The expression for K_f is:\n    K_f = [CaY²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻])\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium):** We can track the concentrations of the species as the system reaches equilibrium. Let 'x' be the change in concentration due to dissociation.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| CaY²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| Y⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n4.  **Substitute equilibrium concentrations into the K_f expression:**\n    K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n5.  **Simplify the equation with an approximation:** The formation constant (K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰) is a very large number. This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex (the left side of the reaction). Consequently, the amount of dissociation 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M).\n    Therefore, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n6.  **Solve for x:** The simplified equation becomes:\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n    Rearranging to solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³ M²\n\n    Now, solve for x, which represents [Ca²⁺]:\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³) M\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n7.  **Check the approximation:** Is 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ much smaller than 0.02? Yes, it is several orders of magnitude smaller, so our approximation was valid.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], at equilibrium is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThe calculation can be confirmed with a short python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex = 0.02\n\n# The equilibrium equation is K_f = (initial_complex - x) / (x**2)\n# Since K_f is very large, x will be very small, so initial_complex - x is approximately initial_complex.\n# K_f ≈ initial_complex / x**2\n# x**2 ≈ initial_complex / K_f\nx_squared = initial_complex / K_f\n# x is the concentration of Ca2+ ions\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"The concentration of calcium ions is approximately {x:.1e} M.\")\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem describes the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\nThe equilibrium reaction for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex (represented as CaY²⁻, where Y⁴⁻ is EDTA) is the reverse of the formation reaction:\nCaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\nThe given constant, KCa-EDTA = 5x10¹⁰, is the formation constant (Kf).\nKf = [CaY²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻])\n\nWe are interested in the dissociation, so let's consider the dissociation constant, Kd.\nKd = 1 / Kf = 1 / (5x10¹⁰) = 2x10⁻¹¹\nFor the dissociation reaction CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻, the equilibrium expression is:\nKd = ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) / [CaY²⁻]\n\nWe can set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to find the concentrations at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| CaY²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| Y⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the Kd expression:\nKd = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n2x10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause Kd is very small (much less than 1), the dissociation will be minimal. This means that 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex, 0.02 M. Therefore, we can make the simplifying assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n2x10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, solve for x²:\nx² ≈ (2x10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² ≈ 4x10⁻¹³\n\nFinally, solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺]:\nx = √(4x10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M. This matches the result from the code execution. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 1.0x10⁻² M\nC) 2.0x10⁻² M\nD) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
