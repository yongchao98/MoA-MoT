    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial Decay Process\n\nThe initial decay is given as `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`.\n*   This represents a process where two nucleons of type A inside a nucleus convert into two nucleons of type B. We can represent the initial nucleus as `N_initial` and the final nucleus as `N_final`.\n*   So, the decay is more accurately written as: `N_initial -> N_final + 2E + 2V`.\n*   This is a \"many-body\" decay because the final state consists of five particles (`N_final`, E, E, V, V).\n*   The problem states that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is **continuous**. This is a key feature of many-body decays. In such decays, the total energy released (the Q-value) is shared statistically among all the final-state particles. Since the V particles can carry away a variable amount of energy (from zero up to a maximum), the energy left for the E particles is also variable, resulting in a continuous spectrum.\n*   The **endpoint** of this spectrum, let's call it `Q_1`, corresponds to the maximum possible total kinetic energy of the two E particles. This maximum occurs when the other light particles (the two V's) carry away the minimum possible kinetic energy, which is zero. (We can neglect the small recoil energy of the heavy final nucleus `N_final`).\n*   The total energy available for the kinetic energies of all final particles is given by the mass difference:\n    `KE_total = m(N_initial)c^2 - (m(N_final)c^2 + 2m_E c^2 + 2m_V c^2)`.\n*   Therefore, the endpoint of the total energy spectrum of the two E particles is:\n    `Q_1 = m(N_initial)c^2 - m(N_final)c^2 - 2m_E c^2 - 2m_V c^2`.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Variant Decay Process\n\nThe variant decay replaces the two V particles with one exotic, massless particle M.\n*   The decay process is now: `N_initial -> N_final + 2E + M`.\n*   The final state now consists of four particles (`N_final`, E, E, M).\n\n### 3. Determining the Nature of the New Spectrum (Continuous vs. Discrete)\n\n*   This variant decay still results in a many-body final state (4 particles). The energy released must be shared among these four particles.\n*   The massless particle M can carry away a variable amount of kinetic energy, just as the V particles did in the original decay.\n*   Because the energy can be distributed in infinite ways among the final particles while still conserving total energy and momentum, the total energy spectrum of the two E particles will remain **continuous**. The shape of the spectrum will be different because the \"phase space\" (the set of all possible kinematic states) has changed (4-body final state instead of 5-body), but it will still be a continuous distribution.\n*   This conclusion eliminates options C and D, which claim the spectrum becomes discrete. A discrete, sharp peak for the summed energy would only occur if there were no other light particles in the final state to carry away a variable amount of energy (like in the hypothetical neutrinoless double beta decay, `N_initial -> N_final + 2E`).\n\n### 4. Comparing the Endpoints of the Spectra\n\nNow we need to determine if the endpoint of the new spectrum is higher or lower than the original one. The endpoint is the maximum possible kinetic energy for the pair of E particles.\n\n*   **Original Endpoint (Q_1):**\n    As determined in step 1, the endpoint corresponds to the total available kinetic energy when the V particles are at rest:\n    `Q_1 = m(N_initial)c^2 - m(N_final)c^2 - 2m_E c^2 - 2m_V c^2`.\n\n*   **New Endpoint (Q_2):**\n    For the variant decay, the endpoint occurs when the other light particle (M) carries away zero kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy available is:\n    `Q_2 = m(N_initial)c^2 - (m(N_final)c^2 + 2m_E c^2 + m_M c^2)`.\n*   The problem states that M is **massless**, so `m_M = 0`.\n    `Q_2 = m(N_initial)c^2 - m(N_final)c^2 - 2m_E c^2`.\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    Let's compare `Q_2` and `Q_1`:\n    `Q_2 = (m(N_initial) - m(N_final) - 2m_E)c^2`\n    `Q_1 = (m(N_initial) - m(N_final) - 2m_E)c^2 - 2m_V c^2`\n    \n    So, `Q_2 = Q_1 + 2m_V c^2`.\n\n    The particle V is described as a \"lighter particle,\" which implies it has some rest mass (`m_V > 0`). In any realistic physical scenario, particles have non-negative mass. Therefore, `2m_V c^2` is a positive quantity.\n    This means `Q_2 > Q_1`. The endpoint of the new spectrum is greater than the endpoint of the original spectrum.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nCombining our findings:\n1.  The spectrum remains **continuous**.\n2.  The endpoint **increases**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
