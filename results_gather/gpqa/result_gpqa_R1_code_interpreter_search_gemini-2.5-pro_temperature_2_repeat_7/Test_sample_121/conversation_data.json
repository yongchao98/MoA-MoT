    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which brominates the α-carbon of a carboxylic acid. Acetic acid has one α-carbon (the methyl group). Pyridine acts as a base to facilitate the reaction and neutralize the HBr byproduct. Acetic anhydride helps form a more reactive intermediate.\n*   **Product 1:** The methyl group of acetic acid is brominated.\n    CH3COOH -> BrCH2COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester and water.\n*   **Product 2:** BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH -> BrCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is an excellent nucleophile, and it displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group, from the primary carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN -> NCCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes an acidic proton from Product 3. The protons on the α-carbon (-CH2-) are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (the nitrile -CN and the ester -COOEt).\n        NCCH2COOEt + NaH -> Na⁺ [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The resulting carbanion is a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br -> NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic α-proton.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH -> Na⁺ [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ + H2\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide ion to form a ring.\n        This intramolecular SN2 reaction forms a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position with both a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group. The structure is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. The question asks for the theoretical number of distinct signals, not what might be practically resolved.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CN\n          |\n     C1--(COOCH2CH3)\n    /  \\\n  C2H2--C6H2\n  |      |\n  C3H2--C5H2\n    \\  /\n     C4H2\n    ```\n\n*   **Symmetry and Ring Protons:**\n    1.  The molecule undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion at room temperature. We analyze the time-averaged structure.\n    2.  The two substituents on C1, cyano (-CN) and ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3), are different. Therefore, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry that would pass through C1 and C4.\n    3.  Because of this lack of symmetry:\n        *   The protons on C2 are in a different environment from the protons on C6.\n        *   The protons on C3 are in a different environment from the protons on C5.\n        *   The protons on C4 are in a unique environment.\n    4.  This means there are five distinct sets of methylene (CH2) groups on the ring: C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    5.  For a rapidly flipping cyclohexane, the two geminal protons (which would be axial and equatorial in a static chair) become chemically equivalent due to time-averaging.\n    6.  Therefore, the ten protons on the cyclohexane ring produce **5 distinct signals**.\n\n*   **Ethyl Group Protons (-COOCH2CH3):**\n    1.  **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 distinct signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Protons (-OCH2-):** These two geminal protons need careful consideration. Although the molecule as a whole is achiral (due to rapid interconversion between enantiomeric chair forms), the bulky and asymmetric nature of the substituted ring can hinder rotation around the C(ring)–C(O) and C(O)–O bonds. This hindered rotation means the two methylene protons experience different average magnetic environments. One proton may be, on average, closer to the cyano group, while the other is further away. This effect, known as being diastereotopic due to restricted rotation, makes them chemically non-equivalent. Therefore, they will give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 5 signals\n    *   From the ethyl's CH3 group: 1 signal\n    *   From the ethyl's OCH2 group: 2 signals\n    *   **Total = 5 + 1 + 2 = 8 signals**\n\nFinal count is 8 distinct hydrogen signals. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
