    "*   **Initial State:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor. This means the net charge on the conductor is zero.\n*   **Placing a Charge:** A positive charge `+q` is placed inside a cavity within the conductor.\n*   **Charge Induction:** Due to electrostatic induction, this `+q` charge will attract negative charges and repel positive charges within the conductor.\n    *   A charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is required by Gauss's Law: if you draw a Gaussian surface entirely within the conducting material (where the electric field must be zero), the net charge enclosed by that surface must be zero. Thus, the charge `+q` inside the cavity must be canceled by an induced charge of `-q` on the cavity wall.\n    *   Since the conductor as a whole was initially neutral, and a charge of `-q` has accumulated on the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere to maintain overall neutrality. This `+q` charge is repelled to the farthest possible location, which is the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n*   **Electrostatic Shielding:** A crucial property of a closed conducting shell is that it acts as an electrostatic shield. The charges inside the conductor (the original `+q` and the induced `-q` on the inner wall) create an electric field. However, the conductor itself rearranges its charges in such a way that the net electric field due to *all* charges (the ones inside the cavity and the ones on the conductor's surfaces) is zero *everywhere inside the conducting material*. A consequence of this shielding is that the distribution of charge on the outer surface is completely independent of the arrangement of charges inside.\n*   **Field Outside the Conductor:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is produced only by the charges on the outer surface of the conductor. The field contribution from the `+q` charge in the cavity and the `-q` charge on the inner surface perfectly cancels out for all points outside the conductor.\n*   **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** We have a charge `+q` induced on the outer surface, which is a sphere of radius R. Since there are no other external charges in the vicinity, this `+q` charge will distribute itself uniformly over the outer spherical surface.\n*   **Calculating the Field at Point P:** For any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is the same as if all the charge on the shell were concentrated into a single point charge at its center.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is at a distance `L` from the point P.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Charge on outer surface}}{(\\text{distance from center})^2}$\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The radius of the cavity (`r`), the location of its center (`s`), the distance of P from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle `\\theta` are all extraneous pieces of information. The external field depends only on the total charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of that surface.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n\nOur derived formula matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
