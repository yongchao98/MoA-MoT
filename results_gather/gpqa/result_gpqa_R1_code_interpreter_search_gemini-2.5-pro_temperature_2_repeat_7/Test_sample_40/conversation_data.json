    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nHere is the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let S be the laboratory frame (the observer's frame).\n    *   Let S' be the rest frame of the glass block. The glass block is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the lab (frame S) is `v`.\n    *   The velocity of light within the glass, as measured in the rest frame of the glass (frame S'), is `u'`. The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. Since the problem states `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   We need to find the velocity of the light beam relative to the laboratory observer (frame S), which we will call `u`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The Galilean addition of velocities (`u = u' + v`) is not accurate at relativistic speeds. We must use the Einstein velocity addition formula. For velocities in the same direction, the formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Given Values:**\n    The problem specifies that the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`. Substituting this and `u' = 1/n` into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    To simplify the complex fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    `u = ( n * (1/n) + n * v ) / ( n * 1 + n * (v/n) )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated speed `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option C.\n\n    *   A) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    *   B) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    *   C) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    *   D) 1\n\nThe correct expression is `(1+n*v)/(n+v)`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
