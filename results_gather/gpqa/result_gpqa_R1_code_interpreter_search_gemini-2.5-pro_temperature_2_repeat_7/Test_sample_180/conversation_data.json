    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Solar Neutrino Sources and their Energies\n\nFirst, let's list the primary neutrino-producing reactions in the Sun's core and the characteristics of the neutrinos they produce. We are interested in the energy ranges of 700-800 keV (Band 1) and 800-900 keV (Band 2).\n\n*   **pp-I Chain:**\n    *   `p + p → d + e⁺ + νₑ` (pp neutrinos): A continuous spectrum with a maximum energy of 420 keV.\n    *   **Contribution:** These neutrinos are below both energy bands.\n\n*   **pp-II Chain:**\n    *   `⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νₑ` (⁷Be neutrinos): Emits neutrinos at two specific energies (lines). The dominant line (about 90% of the time) is at **861 keV**, and a smaller one is at 384 keV.\n    *   **Contribution:** The 861 keV line falls directly into **Band 2 (800-900 keV)**. This is a very significant, high-flux source.\n    *   `p + e⁻ + p → d + νₑ` (pep neutrinos): A mono-energetic line at 1.44 MeV (1440 keV).\n    *   **Contribution:** These neutrinos are above both energy bands.\n\n*   **pp-III Chain:**\n    *   `⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νₑ` (⁸B neutrinos): A continuous spectrum extending up to about 15 MeV.\n    *   **Contribution (Normally):** These high-energy neutrinos would contribute to both Band 1 and Band 2.\n\n*   **CNO Cycle:**\n    *   `¹³N → ¹³C + e⁺ + νₑ` (¹³N neutrinos): Continuous spectrum up to 1200 keV.\n    *   `¹⁵O → ¹⁵N + e⁺ + νₑ` (¹⁵O neutrinos): Continuous spectrum up to 1730 keV.\n    *   **Contribution:** These neutrinos have a continuous spectrum that covers both **Band 1** and **Band 2**.\n\n### 2. Applying the Hypothetical Condition\n\nThe problem states: *\"the pp-III branch suddenly stopped\"*.\n\n*   The pp-III branch is the one that produces **⁸B neutrinos**.\n*   Therefore, in our scenario, the flux of ⁸B neutrinos becomes zero.\n*   Crucially, the problem specifies that *only* the pp-III branch stops. The pp-II branch, which is responsible for the **861 keV ⁷Be neutrino line**, continues to operate as normal.\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Flux in Each Band under the New Condition\n\nLet's re-evaluate what contributes to the flux in each band now that the ⁸B neutrinos are gone.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   The only remaining sources in this energy range are the continuous spectra from the CNO cycle neutrinos (¹³N and ¹⁵O). The total flux of all CNO neutrinos is significant, but it's spread out over a wide energy range. The flux in this narrow 100 keV window will be a relatively small fraction of the total CNO flux.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   This band also has a contribution from the continuous spectra of the CNO cycle neutrinos, similar in magnitude to the contribution in Band 1.\n    *   However, the **dominant feature** in this band is the extremely strong, mono-energetic line of **⁷Be neutrinos at 861 keV**.\n\n### 4. Comparing the Magnitudes and Calculating the Ratio\n\nTo find the ratio, we need to compare the size of the fluxes. We can do this with approximate values from the Standard Solar Model.\n\n*   **Flux (Band 2):** This is dominated by the ⁷Be neutrino line. The flux of this single line (`~4.5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s`) is vastly greater than the flux contribution from the CNO continuum in that same energy window. We can approximate `Flux(Band 2) ≈ Flux(⁷Be line)`.\n\n*   **Flux (Band 1):** This is composed only of the CNO continuum. The total flux from the main CNO sources (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O`) is around `5 x 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s`. This total flux is spread over an energy range of more than 1 MeV. The portion of this flux that falls into the 100 keV wide Band 1 is only a fraction of this total. A reasonable estimate for the flux in this slice is on the order of `~5 x 10⁷ neutrinos/cm²/s`.\n\n*   **The Ratio:**\n    *   `Ratio = Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2)`\n    *   `Ratio ≈ (Flux from CNO slice) / (Flux from ⁷Be line)`\n    *   `Ratio ≈ (a few x 10⁷) / (a few x 10⁹)`\n    *   `Ratio ≈ 10⁷ / 10⁹ = 10⁻² = 0.01`\n\nThe flux in Band 2, dominated by the strong ⁷Be line, is approximately 100 times larger than the flux in Band 1, which only contains a small slice of the much weaker CNO continuous spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2) is approximately 0.01.\n\n<<<D>>>"
