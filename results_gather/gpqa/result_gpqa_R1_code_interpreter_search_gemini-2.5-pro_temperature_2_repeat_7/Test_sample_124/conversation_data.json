    "The user wants me to solve a problem about a 3D isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and its Hamiltonian:** The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. Since $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, the potential can be written as $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. This is a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The key feature is that the potential is separable in Cartesian coordinates, meaning $V(x,y,z) = V_x(x) + V_y(y) + V_z(z)$, where each $V_i(q_i)$ is a 1D harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    *   The energy of a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with potential $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2x^2$ is given by $E_{n_x} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_x = 0, 1, 2, ...$.\n    *   For the 3D isotropic case, the total energy is the sum of the energies from the three independent 1D oscillators in the x, y, and z directions.\n    *   $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n    *   $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   Let's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy formula simplifies to:\n        $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\n3.  **Identify the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy level, which corresponds to the smallest possible value of $n$. Since $n_x, n_y, n_z$ must be non-negative integers, the minimum value for $n$ is $0$ (when $n_x=n_y=n_z=0$). This is the ground state ($n=0$).\n    *   **Excited States:** The excited states correspond to $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$.\n        *   1st Excited State: $n = 1$.\n        *   2nd Excited State: $n = 2$.\n        *   **3rd Excited State: $n = 3$.**\n    *   Now, we calculate the energy for $n=3$:\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    *   The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $n$.\n    *   For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3:\n        $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n    *   This is a classic combinatorial problem. We can either list all possibilities or use a formula.\n    *   **Method 1: Listing the possibilities**\n        *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) — 3 states\n        *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) — 6 states\n        *   Permutations of (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) — 1 state\n        *   Total number of states (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using the degeneracy formula**\n        The number of ways to distribute $n$ identical quanta into $d$ dimensions is given by the formula:\n        $g_n = \\binom{n+d-1}{d-1}$\n        In our case, $n=3$ and $d=3$.\n        $g_3 = \\binom{3+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$.\n\n    *   Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    *   The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) for this energy is 10.\n    *   Comparing this with the options provided:\n        A) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\n        B) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\n        C) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\n        D) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\n    *   Option A matches our result perfectly. The energy expression in options B and C is characteristic of a particle in a spherical potential well, not a harmonic oscillator.\n\n<<<A>>>"
