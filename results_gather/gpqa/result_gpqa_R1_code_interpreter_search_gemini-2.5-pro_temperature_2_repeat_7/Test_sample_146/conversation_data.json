    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Process**\nThe problem describes a particle-antiparticle annihilation. A proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) collide and annihilate, producing four new particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation of Energy**\nThe fundamental principle we need to use is the conservation of total energy. The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n\n**3. Analyze the Initial State**\n*   The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. In such collision problems, it is common to assume we are in the center-of-mass reference frame, where the total initial momentum is zero. This means the proton is also either at rest or moving slowly. Therefore, we can approximate the initial kinetic energy of the system as zero.\n*   The initial energy is thus dominated by the rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton.\n*   $E_{initial} = (\\text{rest energy of } p) + (\\text{rest energy of } \\bar{p})$\n*   A proton and an antiproton have the same rest mass ($m_p = m_{\\bar{p}}$). The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 \\approx 938$ MeV.\n*   So, $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**4. Analyze the Final State**\n*   The final state consists of four particles: $2A^+$ and $2A^-$. They are antiparticles of each other but have the same rest mass, $m_A$.\n*   The given rest mass energy for particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   The initial energy (1876 MeV) is converted into the rest mass energy and kinetic energy of these four final particles.\n*   Since the initial momentum was zero, the final total momentum must also be zero. By symmetry, the total energy will be distributed equally among the four identical-mass particles. Each particle will have the same total energy, $E_A$, and the same speed, $v$.\n*   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles: $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n\n**5. Equate Energies and Solve for Particle Energy**\n*   From the conservation of energy: $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n*   $1876 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n*   Solving for the total energy of a single particle A:\n    $E_A = \\frac{1876 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**6. Relate Energy to Velocity using Special Relativity**\n*   The total energy ($E$) of a relativistic particle is given by the equation $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n*   For particle A, we have: $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n*   We can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5633$\n\n**7. Calculate the Velocity**\n*   Now we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity. It's easier to first solve for $\\beta = v/c$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}} \\implies \\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4091} = \\sqrt{0.5909} \\approx 0.7687$\n*   The velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nTo verify with higher precision:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Rest mass energy of a proton in MeV\nmp_c2 = 938.272\n\n# Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\nma_c2 = 300\n\n# Total initial energy (2 * proton rest mass energy)\nE_initial = 2 * mp_c2\n\n# Total energy of a single final particle A\nE_A = E_initial / 4\n\n# Lorentz factor gamma for particle A\ngamma = E_A / ma_c2\n\n# Velocity factor beta = v/c\nbeta = np.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma**2)\n\nprint(f\"v/c = {beta:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\nv/c = 0.77\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem involves a proton-antiproton annihilation, a process governed by the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### **1. Initial State Energy**\nThe initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\nThe problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" This is a common simplification in such problems, allowing us to neglect the initial kinetic energy. For the total momentum of the system to be zero (which is the case in the center-of-mass frame), the proton must also be moving slowly or be at rest.\nTherefore, the total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) of the system is approximately the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\nA proton and an antiproton have identical rest masses. The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938 MeV.\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n$E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n### **2. Final State Energy**\nThe initial mass is annihilated and converted into four new particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\nSince the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. By symmetry, the total available energy will be distributed equally among the four resulting particles, as they all have the same rest mass ($m_A$).\nLet $E_A$ be the total energy of a single particle A. The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is:\n$E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$\n\n### **3. Conservation of Energy**\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, the total initial energy must equal the total final energy:\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$1876 \\, \\text{MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\nWe can solve for the total energy of one particle A:\n$E_A = \\frac{1876 \\, \\text{MeV}}{4} = 469 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n### **4. Relativistic Energy and Velocity**\nThe total energy ($E_A$) of a relativistic particle is related to its rest mass ($m_A c^2$) and its velocity ($v$) through the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\nwhere $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\nWe are given that $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$. We can now find the Lorentz factor for particle A:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\, \\text{MeV}}{300 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx 1.5633$\n\n### **5. Calculating the Velocity**\nNow we can solve for the velocity, $v$. It's often easier to first solve for $\\beta = v/c$.\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\nRearranging the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\nSubstituting the value of $\\gamma$ we found:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4091} = \\sqrt{0.5909}$\n$\\beta \\approx 0.7687$\nTherefore, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option B. The code execution confirmed this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
