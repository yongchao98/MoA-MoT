    "This problem can be solved by using the energy-time uncertainty principle from quantum mechanics.\n\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** The core principle needed to solve this problem is the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state.\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π).\n\n2.  **Linewidth of Energy Levels:** A quantum state with a finite lifetime (τ) does not have a perfectly defined energy. Instead, its energy is \"smeared\" out over a range ΔE, often called the natural linewidth. For calculation purposes, we can approximate the relationship as:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n3.  **Resolving Two Energy Levels:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two separate energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than their combined linewidths. A common criterion (the Rayleigh criterion for spectroscopy) is that the separation should be at least equal to the sum of the individual linewidths (full width at half maximum).\n    |E₁ - E₂| ≥ ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    At the very least, the separation must be greater than the broader of the two linewidths. Let's calculate the total linewidth.\n\n4.  **Calculate Individual Linewidths (ΔE):**\n    *   We need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of eV·s:\n        ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n    *   For the first state (State 1):\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Linewidth ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   For the second state (State 2):\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Linewidth ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Calculate the Minimum Energy Separation:**\n    *   The total linewidth is ΔE_total = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂.\n    *   ΔE_total ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   ΔE_total ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   For the levels to be clearly resolved, their energy difference must be greater than ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   Let's check the given options:\n        A) 10⁻⁹ eV (This is much smaller than the required separation.)\n        B) 10⁻⁴ eV (This is much larger than the required separation, so the levels would be very clearly resolved.)\n        C) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is much smaller than the required separation.)\n        D) 10⁻⁸ eV (This is smaller than the required separation, as it is even smaller than the linewidth of the first state alone.)\n\nTo be certain of the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eV_s = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state\n# Delta_E is approximately hbar / tau\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eV_s / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eV_s / tau2\n\n# To resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them must be\n# greater than the sum of their individual linewidths.\ntotal_linewidth = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Linewidth of state 1 (Delta_E1): {delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Linewidth of state 2 (Delta_E2): {delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Total linewidth (minimum required separation): {total_linewidth:.4e} eV\")\n\n# Compare this required separation with the given options\noptions = {\n    'A': 1e-9,\n    'B': 1e-4,\n    'C': 1e-11,\n    'D': 1e-8\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nChecking the options against the required separation:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    is_resolvable = value > total_linewidth\n    print(f\"Option {option}: {value:.1e} eV.

Of the choices provided, only 10⁻⁴ eV is greater than this value.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants to find the correct energy difference to distinguish two quantum states based on their lifetimes.\n\n1.  **Understand the physics principle:** The problem relies on the Heisenberg energy-time uncertainty principle. This principle implies that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt) cannot have a perfectly defined energy. Its energy is spread over a range (ΔE), known as the natural linewidth. The relationship is given by ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2. For practical calculations, we often use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, where τ is the lifetime.\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy spread (linewidth) for each state:**\n    *   State 1: Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   State 2: Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    The linewidth for state 1 is:\n    ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    The linewidth for state 2 is:\n    ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n3.  **Determine the condition for resolving the two levels:** To clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the energy difference between them (|E₁ - E₂|) must be larger than their combined energy spreads. A common criterion is that the energy difference should be at least as large as the sum of their individual linewidths (or full widths at half maximum).\n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n4.  **Calculate the required minimum energy difference:**\n    Minimum energy difference ≈ ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    Minimum energy difference ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    Minimum energy difference ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    Minimum energy difference ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n5.  **Compare the required minimum difference with the given options:**\n    The energy difference |E₁ - E₂| must be greater than approximately 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV (Less than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV (Greater than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV (Less than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV (Less than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV, it's smaller than the linewidth of state 1 alone)\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The only energy difference large enough to ensure the two levels are clearly resolved is 10⁻⁴ eV. The Python code execution confirms this logic and calculation, showing that only option B satisfies the condition |E₁ - E₂| > (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂).\n\n<<<B>>>"
