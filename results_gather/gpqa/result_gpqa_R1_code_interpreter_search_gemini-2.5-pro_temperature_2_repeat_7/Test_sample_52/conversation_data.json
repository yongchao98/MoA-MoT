    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information from the problem description:**\n\n*   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring with two substituents, formula C6H4.\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:** An ester group (-COO-) is present. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms seen in all the chemical formula options.\n*   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** For a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the four aromatic protons strongly suggests a symmetrical `para` (1,4) substitution pattern. An `ortho` or `meta` substitution would typically result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons. So, we have a `p-C6H4` group (4 hydrogens).\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a `-CH=CH-CH3` group.\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   This fragment has the formula `C3H5` (2 vinyl-H + 3 methyl-H).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** One methyl signal comes from the `-CH=CH-CH3` group identified above. The second signal must correspond to another, chemically distinct methyl group somewhere else in the molecule.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a key constraint that eliminates any structures containing a methylene bridge or an ethyl group, for example.\n\n**2. Assemble the molecular fragments:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following pieces of the molecule:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: **-C6H4-**\n*   An ester group: **-COO-**\n*   A propenyl group: **-CH=CH-CH3**\n*   A second, distinct methyl group: **-CH3**\n\n**3. Construct a valid chemical structure:**\n\nWe need to combine these fragments into a single molecule that respects all the given information. The molecule has two substituents on the benzene ring. Let's consider the possibilities for forming the ester and placing the substituents.\n\n*   **Possibility A: Methyl benzoate derivative**\n    *   One substituent on the ring is the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n    *   The other substituent is a methyl ester group (`-COO-CH3`). This uses the ester fragment and the second methyl group.\n    *   The resulting structure is **methyl p-propenylbenzoate**: `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COO-CH3`.\n    *   This structure fits all the data: it's para-substituted, has a propenyl group with the correct NMR signature, has two distinct methyl groups, and crucially, has no `-CH2-` groups.\n\n*   **Possibility B: Phenyl acetate derivative**\n    *   One substituent is the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n    *   The other substituent is an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH3`). This uses the ester and the second methyl group.\n    *   The resulting structure is **p-propenylphenyl acetate**: `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-O-CO-CH3`.\n    *   This structure also fits all the given spectroscopic data.\n\n**4. Determine the Chemical Formula:**\n\nNow, let's calculate the chemical formula for the valid structures we've proposed. Both possibilities will lead to the same formula. We will use Possibility A for the calculation.\n\n*   **Carbon atoms (C):**\n    *   From the benzene ring (C6H4): 6\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3\n    *   From the ester carbonyl group (-COO-): 1\n    *   From the ester methyl group (-OCH3): 1\n    *   **Total Carbons = 6 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 11**\n\n*   **Hydrogen atoms (H):**\n    *   From the aromatic ring (C6H4): 4\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 5\n    *   From the ester methyl group (-OCH3): 3\n    *   **Total Hydrogens = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12**\n\n*   **Oxygen atoms (O):**\n    *   From the ester group (-COO-): 2\n    *   **Total Oxygens = 2**\n\nCombining these, the chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nThe derived chemical formula C11H12O2 matches one of the given options. Other options are incorrect. For example, C12H12O2 has an extra carbon which cannot be added without violating the NMR data, and C11H14O2/C12H14O2 have too many hydrogens, which would imply saturation of the C=C bond, contradicting the presence of vinyl-H signals.\n\n<<<B>>>"
