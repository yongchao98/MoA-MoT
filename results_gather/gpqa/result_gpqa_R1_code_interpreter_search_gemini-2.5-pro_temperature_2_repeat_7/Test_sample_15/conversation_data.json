    "*   **Analysis of Optical Activity**\n    A compound is optically active if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most often caused by the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers). A molecule with stereocenters can still be achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, in which case it is called a meso compound. We will examine each compound for these features.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   Structure: `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In this molecule, there are no such carbon atoms.\n    *   The carbon atoms of the double bond are sp2 hybridized. C3 is bonded to two H atoms. C4 is a methyl group. The methyl on C2 is a methyl group.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond which leads to geometric isomerism (Z/E), but it does not have any chiral centers. The molecule itself is planar. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name itself provides the stereochemistry using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (R/S) notation: `(3aR,7aS)`. This notation is used to define the absolute configuration of specific stereocenters.\n    *   When a specific enantiomer is named (e.g., with R/S descriptors), it is, by definition, chiral and therefore optically active, unless it is a meso compound.\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The designations `3aR` and `7aS` refer to two different stereocenters. For it to be a meso compound, there would have to be an element of symmetry (like a plane) that makes the molecule as a whole superimposable on its mirror image. Given the complex, non-symmetrical name and structure elements (`chloromethylene`, `methanoisobenzofuran` fused system), it is extremely unlikely to possess such symmetry. The name specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer that is not its own mirror image.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The two stereocenters are structurally equivalent (both are `CH(COOH)(CH3)`).\n    *   When a molecule has two equivalent stereocenters with opposite configurations (one R, one S), it is a meso compound. Meso compounds have an internal element of symmetry (a plane or center of inversion in one of its conformations) that makes them achiral overall, despite having stereocenters.\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is the meso isomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. It has a center of inversion in its anti-staggered conformation and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. It has two stereocenters, C2 and C3, both with the R configuration.\n    *   Its mirror image is (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image and lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Therefore, it is chiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   Let's check C1 for chirality. The four groups attached to C1 are: -OH, -H, the ring segment `-CH2-CH=` and the other ring segment `-CH2-CH2-CH=`. These four groups are different. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The specified isomer is the one where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's analyze the symmetry of this molecule. In a chair conformation where all three OH groups are axial (or all are equatorial), the molecule has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (Ïƒv).\n    *   Any molecule possessing a plane of symmetry is achiral. Since this isomer is highly symmetric, it is achiral.\n    *   In fact, the carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not true stereocenters in this isomer, because the two paths around the ring from each of these carbons are identical. The use of lowercase `s` often designates prochiral centers in an overall achiral molecule.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   Let's determine the structure from the IUPAC name.\n    *   The parent chain is `butan-1-one`: a four-carbon chain with a ketone `(=O)` at C1.\n    *   Substituents are `1-cyclopentyl` (a cyclopentyl group on C1) and `3-methyl` (a methyl group on C3).\n    *   Assembling the structure: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   This structure can also be called `cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers (carbon with four different groups).\n    *   The carbon at position 3 is `CH`. It is bonded to a `H`, a terminal `CH3` (C4), the `CH3` substituent, and the `-CH2-C(=O)-...` group. The two methyl groups attached to C3 are identical. So, C3 is not a chiral center.\n    *   There are no other sp3 carbons with four different groups in the rest of the molecule. The molecule has no chiral centers and can adopt conformations with a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary**\n\n*   Optically Active:\n    1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n*   Optically Inactive:\n    1.  (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    2.  (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    3.  (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    4.  1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
