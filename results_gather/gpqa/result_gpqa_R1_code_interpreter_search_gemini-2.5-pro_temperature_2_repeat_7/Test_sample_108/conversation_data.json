    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\n*   **State:** The initial two-nucleon (NN) system is in a `1S0` state.\n*   **Quantum Numbers:** From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` => Total initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L` is `S` => Initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J` is `0` => Total initial angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity:** The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `P = (-1)^L`.\n    *   Initial parity `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nThe reaction is `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.\n\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are also given that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting `T(NN) = 0` into the rule: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number (like 0, 2, 4...).\n    *   Therefore, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number. This is a crucial test for the final NN state.\n\n*   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The total angular momentum of the system must be conserved.\n    *   `J_initial = J_final_total`.\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   `J_final_total` is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`).\n    *   `vec(J_final_total) = vec(J_f) + vec(j_X)`. For this sum to be 0, the magnitudes must be equal, `J_f = j_X`, and their vectors must be opposite.\n    *   Particle X has orbital angular momentum `l_X` (given by s, p, d, f...). The problem does not state its spin (`s_X`). In such problems, it is standard to assume the emitted particle is spinless (e.g., a pion), so `s_X = 0`.\n    *   If `s_X = 0`, then `j_X = l_X`. The condition simplifies to `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity (P):** The total parity of the system must be conserved.\n    *   `P_initial = P_final_total`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   `P_final_total = P_{NN,f} * P_X`.\n    *   `P_{NN,f} = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n    *   The parity of particle X is `P_X = (P_intrinsic_X) * (-1)^{l_X}`. We are given that the intrinsic parity of X is -1.\n    *   `P_X = (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{l_X + 1}`.\n    *   So, `P_final_total = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1)^{l_X + 1} = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n    *   The conservation law `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}` requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be even.\n    *   Therefore, `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will check each option against these three rules:\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n3.  **Angular Momentum:** `J_f = l_X`.\n\n---\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n---\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1 = 7` implies `S_f=3`.\n*   A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin `S = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0` (singlet) or `S = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1` (triplet).\n*   A total spin of `S_f=3` is impossible for a two-nucleon system. The final state `7D1` is unphysical.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because the final NN state cannot exist.\n\n---\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). OK.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n---\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). **This violates the Pauli principle requirement** for a final state with T=0.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 0`, `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nWe have found two non-permitted transitions: B and D.\n*   Option B is forbidden because the final NN state (`7D1`) is fundamentally impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Option D is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics rule provided in the problem for a final NN state with `T=0`. The state `3P0` itself is possible for two nucleons, but it must have `T=1` to satisfy the Pauli principle (`L+S+T=1+1+1=3` odd), not `T=0` as required by the problem.\n\nThe question explicitly asks the solver to use the Pauli statistics requirement. Option D fails this specific test. Option B fails on a more basic state-composition ground. In physics problems of this nature, one should prioritize the rules explicitly given. The transition in D satisfies conservation laws but fails the additional constraint imposed by the Pauli principle, which is what the question appears designed to test.\n\n<<<D>>>"
