  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Decipher the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from the provided spectral data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   The broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid. The frequency is slightly lower than a typical aliphatic acid, suggesting conjugation with an aromatic ring.\n        *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X contains a carboxylic acid group attached to a benzene ring.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This highly deshielded, broad singlet for one proton confirms the presence of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**).\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, causing their downfield shift. The protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other alkyl substituent.\n        *   **Alkyl group analysis:**\n            *   We have a remaining C4H9 alkyl fragment to identify from the remaining signals.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂-) with multiple different neighboring protons. It's likely adjacent to the CH₃ at 0.9 ppm and the CH at 2.9 ppm.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton. Its downfield chemical shift suggests it is a benzylic proton (directly attached to the benzene ring). It is coupled to the CH₃ at 1.4 ppm and the CH₂ at 1.7 ppm.\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The pieces fit together as a sec-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃). The -CH group is attached to the ring.\n        *   **Structure of Compound X:** Putting everything together, the structure of Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This matches option B.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is reacted with red phosphorus and hydriodic acid (Red P + HI).\n    *   **Reagent Function:** Red P + HI is a very strong reducing agent. It is known to fully reduce a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group directly to a methyl (-CH₃) group. It does not affect the aromatic ring or the saturated alkyl side chain.\n    *   **Transformation:** The -COOH group on the benzene ring will be converted to a -CH₃ group. The sec-butyl group at position 4 will remain unchanged.\n    *   **Final Product:** The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is converted into 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our deduced final product.\n    *   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, Compound X.\n    *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This is an incorrect isomer of Compound X.\n    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has an isobutyl group, not a sec-butyl group.\n\nTherefore, the correct final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
