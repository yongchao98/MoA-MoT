    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Principle:** The problem asks about the ratio of the population of two energy levels in neutral Titanium atoms under different temperature conditions. Since the stellar photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms among different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an upper energy level (N₂) to a lower energy level (N₁) is given by:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    Where:\n    *   N₂/N₁ is the population ratio.\n    *   g₂/g₁ is the ratio of statistical weights of the levels (a constant for this specific transition).\n    *   ΔE = E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Define the Two States:** We need to calculate this population ratio for two different temperatures:\n    *   State 1 (No Spots): T_ns = 6000 K\n    *   State 2 (With Spots): T_s = 5500 K\n\n    Let's denote the population ratios in these two states as:\n    *   Ratio_ns = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_ns))\n    *   Ratio_s = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_s))\n\n4.  **Determine the Required Factor:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes *when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots*. This translates to calculating the ratio `Ratio_ns / Ratio_s`.\n\n    Factor = Ratio_ns / Ratio_s = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_ns)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_s)) ]\n\n    The statistical weight ratio (g₂/g₁) cancels out:\n    Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_ns)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_s))\n\n    Using the properties of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)):\n    Factor = exp( (-ΔE / (k * T_ns)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_s)) )\n    Factor = exp( (ΔE / (k * T_s)) - (ΔE / (k * T_ns)) )\n    Factor = exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_s - 1/T_ns) )\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy difference between the levels corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength, λ = 1448 Å.\n    A convenient formula to find the energy in electron volts (eV) from the wavelength in Angstroms (Å) is:\n    ΔE (eV) = 12400 / λ (Å)\n    ΔE = 12400 / 1448 ≈ 8.5635 eV\n\n6.  **Calculate the Factor:** Now we substitute all the known values into the factor equation.\n    *   ΔE = 8.5635 eV\n    *   k = 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n    *   T_s = 5500 K\n    *   T_ns = 6000 K\n\n    Let's compute the terms:\n    *   ΔE / k = 8.5635 / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 99379 K\n    *   (1/T_s - 1/T_ns) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) = 500 / 33,000,000 ≈ 1.515 x 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹\n\n    Exponent = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_s - 1/T_ns) ≈ 99379 * 1.515 x 10⁻⁵ ≈ 1.5057\n\n    Factor = exp(1.5057) ≈ 4.507\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** The factor is approximately 4.5. This aligns with the observation that the ratio \"decreases when the star has spots\", meaning the ratio is higher when there are no spots (at the higher temperature of 6000 K).\n\nTo ensure precision, the following Python code performs the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nk_eV = 8.617333262e-5  # Boltzmann constant in eV/K\n\n# Given values\nT_ns = 6000  # Temperature without spots in K\nT_s = 5500   # Temperature with spots in K\nwavelength_A = 1448  # Wavelength in Angstroms\n\n# Calculate the energy difference (Delta_E) in eV\n# Delta_E (eV) = 12400 / wavelength (in Angstroms)\nDelta_E = 12400 / wavelength_A\n\n# The Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-Delta_E / (k * T))\n# We want to find the factor F = Ratio_ns / Ratio_s\n# F = [exp(-Delta_E / (k * T_ns))] / [exp(-Delta_E / (k * T_s))]\n# F = exp(-Delta_E/k * (1/T_ns - 1/T_s))\n# F = exp(Delta_E/k * (1/T_s - 1/T_ns))\n\n# Calculate the exponent\nexponent = (Delta_E / k_eV) * (1/T_s - 1/T_ns)\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = math.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(factor)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem requires us to find the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when a star's surface goes from having no spots to being 40% covered by spots. This change in spot coverage causes the overall effective temperature to drop from 6000 K to 5500 K.\n\n**1. Understand the physical principle:**\nThe distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation, as the stellar photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n**2. State the Boltzmann Equation:**\nThe ratio of the population of an upper energy level (N₂) to a lower energy level (N₁) is given by:\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\nwhere:\n*   `N₂ / N₁` is the population ratio.\n*   `g₂ / g₁` is the ratio of the statistical weights of the levels. Since we are considering the same transition in both scenarios, this ratio is a constant.\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two levels (E₂ - E₁).\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the effective temperature of the photosphere in Kelvin.\n\n**3. Define the two scenarios:**\n*   **Scenario 1: No spots.** The temperature is T_ns = 6000 K.\n    The population ratio is: Ratio_ns = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_ns))\n*   **Scenario 2: With spots.** The temperature is T_s = 5500 K.\n    The population ratio is: Ratio_s = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_s))\n\n**4. Calculate the required factor:**\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star *does not have spots* compared to *when it has spots*. This is the ratio of the population ratios:\nFactor = Ratio_ns / Ratio_s\n\nFactor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_ns)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_s)) ]\n\nThe term `(g₂ / g₁)` cancels out:\nFactor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_ns)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_s))\n\nUsing the property of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)):\nFactor = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_ns)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_s)) ]\nFactor = exp[ (ΔE / (k * T_s)) - (ΔE / (k * T_ns)) ]\nFactor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_s - 1/T_ns) ]\n\n**5. Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):**\nThe energy of the transition can be calculated from the given wavelength, λ = 1448 Å (Angstroms).\nUsing the formula E = hc/λ. A practical version for astronomy is:\nΔE (in eV) = 12400 / λ (in Å)\nΔE = 12400 / 1448 ≈ 8.5635 eV\n\n**6. Perform the final calculation:**\nWe have:\n*   ΔE = 8.5635 eV\n*   k (Boltzmann constant) = 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n*   T_s = 5500 K\n*   T_ns = 6000 K\n\nSubstitute these values into the factor equation:\nFactor = exp[ (8.5635 eV / 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) * (1/5500 K - 1/6000 K) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99379 * (0.0001818 - 0.0001667) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99379 * (1.515 x 10⁻⁵) ]\nFactor = exp(1.5057)\nFactor ≈ 4.507\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5. This result aligns with the provided code output and corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
