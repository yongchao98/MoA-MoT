    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Potential**\n\nThe given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nThe Schrödinger equation with this potential is not easily separable in polar coordinates due to the mixed terms. The best approach is to convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y).\n\n**2. Convert to Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nWe use the standard conversion formulas:\n*   x = r cos(θ)\n*   y = r sin(θ)\n*   r² = x² + y²\n\nNow, we substitute these into the potential expression.\n\nThe first term is:\n1/2 kr² = 1/2 k(x² + y²)\n\nThe second term can be rewritten using x = r cos(θ):\n3/2 kr² cos²(θ) = 3/2 k (r cos(θ))² = 3/2 kx²\n\nNow, we add the two parts of the potential together:\nV(x, y) = [1/2 k(x² + y²)] + [3/2 kx²]\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx² + 1/2 ky² + 3/2 kx²\n\nCombine the terms with x²:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2) kx² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = (4/2) kx² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\n**3. Identify the Separable System**\n\nThe potential in Cartesian coordinates is:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\n*   V_x(x) = 2kx²\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 ky²\n\nThis shows that the potential is separable into two independent one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillators, one moving along the x-axis and the other along the y-axis.\n\n**4. Find the Energy of a 1D Quantum Harmonic Oscillator (QHO)**\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D QHO with a potential V(q) = 1/2 Kq² are given by the formula:\nE_n = (n + 1/2)ħω\nwhere the angular frequency ω is related to the effective spring constant K and mass m by:\nω = sqrt(K/m)\n\n**5. Calculate the Energy for Each Dimension**\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    The potential is V_x(x) = 2kx² = 1/2 (4k)x².\n    The effective spring constant is K_x = 4k.\n    The angular frequency is ω_x = sqrt(K_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m).\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-oscillator are:\n    E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\n    E_{n_x} = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    The potential is V_y(y) = 1/2 ky².\n    The effective spring constant is K_y = k.\n    The angular frequency is ω_y = sqrt(K_y / m) = sqrt(k / m).\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-oscillator are:\n    E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Energy**\n\nSince the Hamiltonian is separable (H = H_x + H_y), the total energy E is the sum of the energies from the two independent oscillators:\nE = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\nE = [(2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m)] + [(n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)]\n\nNow, factor out the common term ħ * sqrt(k/m):\nE = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe quantum numbers n_x and n_y can take any integer value 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n**7. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m).\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
