    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the initial and final states:**\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is given as E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2, and kinetic energies T1 and T2.\n*   **Given Conditions:**\n    *   m1 = 2 * m2 (The more massive fragment, which we label as 1, is twice as massive as the other).\n    *   m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:**\n*   We can use the given conditions to find the masses m1 and m2 in terms of M.\n    *   Substitute m1 = 2*m2 into the second equation:\n        (2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M\n        3 * m2 = 0.99 * M\n        m2 = 0.33 * M\n    *   Now find m1:\n        m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M.\n*   Next, calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments (m1*c^2 and m2*c^2):\n    *   m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n    *   m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n**3. Determine the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\n*   Energy must be conserved. The total initial energy must equal the total final energy.\n    *   E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV.\n    *   E_final = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2) = 198 GeV + 99 GeV + T1 + T2 = 297 GeV + T1 + T2.\n*   Equating initial and final energy:\n    *   300 GeV = 297 GeV + T1 + T2.\n*   This gives the total kinetic energy of the fragments:\n    *   T_total = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation:**\n*   Momentum must also be conserved. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. This means the fragments fly apart in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let this momentum magnitude be p.\n    *   |p1| = |p2| = p.\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m).\n    *   T1 = p^2 / (2 * m1)\n    *   T2 = p^2 / (2 * m2)\n*   From these equations, we can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    *   T1 / T2 = (p^2 / 2m1) / (p^2 / 2m2) = m2 / m1.\n*   Since m1 = 2*m2, we get:\n    *   T1 / T2 = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2, which means T2 = 2 * T1.\n*   Now use the total kinetic energy relationship, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV:\n    *   T1 + (2 * T1) = 3 GeV\n    *   3 * T1 = 3 GeV\n    *   T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV.\n\n**5. Calculate the correct T1 value using relativistic mechanics:**\n*   Again, conservation of momentum gives |p1| = |p2| = p.\n*   The relativistic relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2.\n*   The total energy is also the sum of its rest-mass energy and kinetic energy: E = T + m*c^2.\n*   We can rearrange these to solve for momentum: (p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2.\n*   Substituting E = T + m*c^2 gives:\n    *   (p*c)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2).\n*   Now we apply this to both fragments. Since their momentum magnitudes (p) are the same, their (p*c)^2 values are also the same:\n    *   For fragment 1: (p*c)^2 = T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1*c^2)\n    *   For fragment 2: (p*c)^2 = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2*c^2)\n*   Set the right-hand sides equal and substitute the rest-mass energy values:\n    *   T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (99)\n*   Use the relationship T2 = 3 - T1 (from T1 + T2 = 3 GeV) and substitute it into the equation:\n    *   T1^2 + 396 * T1 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * 99\n*   Now, solve for T1. First, expand the right side:\n    *   T1^2 + 396 * T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)\n*   Combine terms on the right side:\n    *   T1^2 + 396 * T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603\n*   The T1^2 terms cancel out. Move all T1 terms to the left side:\n    *   396 * T1 + 204 * T1 = 603\n    *   600 * T1 = 603\n*   Solve for the correct relativistic kinetic energy, T1:\n    *   T1_rel = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n*   Convert this to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    *   T1_rel = 1.005 * 1000 MeV = 1005 MeV.\n\n**6. Find the difference:**\n*   Difference = (correct T1 value) - (T1 value from classical approximation)\n*   Difference = T1_rel - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>"
