    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a benzene ring (C6H5-) with different substituents. The yield of the *para*-isomer depends on two main properties of the substituent already on the ring:\n\n1.  **Directing Effect:** Substituents direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to specific positions.\n    *   **Activating groups** (electron-donating) direct to the *ortho* and *para* positions. Examples: -CH3, -C2H5.\n    *   **Deactivating groups** (electron-withdrawing) direct to the *meta* position. Examples: -NO2, -COOH, -COOC2H5.\n    *   **Halogens** are a special case: they are deactivating but *ortho, para*-directing. Example: -Cl.\n\n2.  **Steric Hindrance:** Bulky substituents can block the *ortho* positions, which are adjacent to the substituent. This makes substitution at the more distant *para* position more favorable.\n\nThe substances can be divided into two groups: those that primarily form *meta* products (low para-yield) and those that primarily form *ortho* and *para* products (high para-yield).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the *Meta*-Directing Groups\n\nThese groups will produce the lowest yields of the para-isomer. The substituents are:\n*   **4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **6) -COOH (Benzoic acid):** Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nFor *meta*-directors, the yield of the minor *para*-product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the *meta* position, thus producing even less of the *ortho* and *para* isomers.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing *para*-isomer yield for these three substances will be the reverse of their deactivating strength:\n**-NO2 < -COOH < -COOC2H5**\nThis corresponds to the substance numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n*   For nitrobenzene (4), the para yield is extremely low (~1%).\n*   For benzoic acid (6), the para yield is low (~2%).\n*   For ethyl benzoate (2), the para yield is slightly higher but still low (~3-4%).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the *Ortho, Para*-Directing Groups\n\nThese groups will produce the highest yields of the *para*-isomer. The substituents are:\n*   **1) -CH3 (Toluene):** Activating, *o,p*-director.\n*   **5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** Activating, *o,p*-director.\n*   **3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene):** Deactivating, *o,p*-director.\n\nTo determine the order within this group, we need to compare the ratio of *para* to *ortho* products.\n\n*   **-CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This causes more steric hindrance at the *ortho* positions in ethylbenzene. Consequently, substitution at the *para* position is more favored for ethylbenzene than for toluene.\n    *   Therefore, para yield: **-CH3 < -C2H5** or **1 < 5**.\n    *   Literature data supports this: Toluene gives ~67% para-isomer, while ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage (e.g., ~75-80%) due to increased steric hindrance.\n\n*   **-Cl (3):** Halogens are a unique case. The -Cl group is deactivating due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect, but its lone pairs allow for resonance donation, making it *o,p*-directing. The strong inductive effect deactivates the adjacent *ortho* positions more than the distant *para* position. This electronic factor, combined with the steric size of the chlorine atom, leads to a very high selectivity for the *para* position.\n    *   Literature data for bromination of chlorobenzene shows a very high para yield, around 89%.\n\n*   **Comparing all three:**\n    *   Toluene (1): ~67% para\n    *   Ethylbenzene (5): >67% para (e.g., ~75-80%)\n    *   Chlorobenzene (3): ~89% para\n\nThe order of increasing *para*-isomer yield is: **-CH3 < -C2H5 < -Cl**.\nThis corresponds to the substance numbers: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Groups\n\nBy combining the orders from both groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest para-yield to the highest.\n\n*   *Meta*-directors (low yield): **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   *Ortho, para*-directors (high yield): **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 5: Match with the Options\n\nThe derived order **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3** matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
