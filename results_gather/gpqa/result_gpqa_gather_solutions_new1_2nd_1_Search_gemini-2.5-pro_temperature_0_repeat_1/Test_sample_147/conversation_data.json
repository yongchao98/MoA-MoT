To find the most likely answer, we must evaluate the different hypotheses presented by the agents and identify the one that provides the most coherent explanation.\n\n### Analysis of Hypotheses\n\n1.  **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis (Answers 1, 3, 4, 5, 11):**\n    *   **Pros:** Krypton's chemistry involves highly reactive, unstable fluorides that can oxidize xenon. The mass percentage of fluorine in KrF₂ (~31.2%) is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **Cons:** Krypton only has two well-established binary fluorides (KrF₂ and KrF₄), which contradicts the \"five binary compounds\" clue. Also, KrF₄ is a white solid, not \"bright-red\". This hypothesis requires ignoring several key clues.\n\n2.  **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis (Answers 2, 6, 8, 12, 13):**\n    *   **Pros:** The mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ (31.89%) is an excellent match for the given 31.96%.\n    *   **Cons:** Antimony only has two common binary fluorides (SbF₃ and SbF₅), contradicting the \"five compounds\" clue. The comproportionation reaction `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃` does not have the 1:1 molar ratio described. This hypothesis fails on major structural clues.\n\n3.  **Americium (Am) Hypothesis (Answer 7):**\n    *   **Pros:** This hypothesis is chemically very strong. Americium is known to form five binary fluorides. The mass percentage of fluorine in AmF₆ (31.93%) is an almost perfect match. The reaction chemistry, including the 1:1 comproportionation, can be explained consistently.\n    *   **Cons:** The derived molecular weight for A4 (AmF₄) is ~319 g/mol, which does not fall into any of the provided answer ranges. This suggests the options are flawed, but we must choose from them.\n\n4.  **Gold (Au) Hypothesis (Answer 10):**\n    *   **Pros:** This hypothesis provides the best balance of satisfying all clues while leading to one of the given options.\n        *   **\"Five binary compounds\":** Gold is known to form multiple fluorides (AuF, AuF₂, AuF₃, AuF₅, and a complex sometimes denoted AuF₇), making this plausible.\n        *   **\"Oxidizes xenon\":** Higher gold fluorides like AuF₅ are extremely powerful oxidizing agents.\n        *   **\"Bright-red substance\":** AuF₅ is a red solid.\n        *   **Mass Percentage:** The fluorine percentage in AuF₅ (~32.5%) is a reasonable match for A2 (31.96%).\n        *   **1:1 Reaction:** The comproportionation reaction `Au + AuF₂ → 2AuF` has a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants (Y and A4). This identifies **A4 as AuF₂**.\n        *   **Molecular Weight:** The molecular weight of A4 (AuF₂) is calculated as 197.0 (Au) + 2 * 19.0 (F) = **235.0 g/mol**. This value fits perfectly within the **220-240** range.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the problem is flawed, the Gold (Au) hypothesis provides the most comprehensive and consistent explanation. It satisfies the difficult qualitative clues (five compounds, color, reactivity) and the quantitative reaction stoichiometry, while leading directly to one of the numerical answer choices. The slight discrepancy in the mass percentage is a minor issue compared to the major contradictions in the other hypotheses.\n\nTherefore, the most logical conclusion is that A4 is AuF₂, and its molecular weight falls in the 220-240 range.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle that requires careful, step-by-step deduction. Many of the clues are qualitative and can be misleading, so it is crucial to ground the analysis in the quantitative data provided.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2**\n\n*   The problem states that substance A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n*   The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F)), where M(Y) is the molar mass of Y, M(F) is the molar mass of F (≈19.00 g/mol), and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n*   Rearranging the formula to solve for M(Y) gives the relationship: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n.\n*   We test small integer values for n:\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.5 g/mol (e.g., Ca, Ar)\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Br, Se, Kr)\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol (e.g., Sb)\n*   The clues about compounds oxidizing xenon under normal conditions strongly point to a noble gas or a highly electronegative element. Krypton (Kr, M=83.8 g/mol) is an excellent candidate. If Y is Kr and n=2, the theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in KrF₂ is (2 × 19.00) / (83.8 + 38.0) ≈ 31.2%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96% and is the most plausible fit given the chemical context.\n*   Therefore, we can tentatively identify **Y as Krypton (Kr)** and **A2 as Krypton difluoride (KrF₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Other Compounds based on the Krypton Hypothesis**\n\n*   **A1:** A1 decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine (F₂). This implies A1 is a higher fluoride of krypton. The reaction is A1 → KrF₂ + F₂. This identifies **A1 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)**. The description of A1 as \"bright-red\" and decomposing at room temperature (293 K) fits the profile of a highly unstable, reactive compound like KrF₄ (though KrF₄ is typically described as a white solid, such discrepancies are common in puzzle-like problems).\n*   **A3:** A3 is formed by fluorinating Y (Kr) and also oxidizes xenon. This describes KrF₂, which is formed from Kr + F₂ and is a powerful oxidizing agent. So, A3 is also KrF₂.\n*   **A4 and A5:** This is the crucial step. The reaction is described as adding Y (Kr) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio to obtain A5.\n    *   Reaction: **Kr + A4 → A5** (1:1 molar ratio of reactants)\n    *   This is a classic comproportionation reaction, where an element in its zero oxidation state (Kr) reacts with a compound of the same element in a higher oxidation state (A4) to form a product with an intermediate oxidation state (A5).\n    *   The only known reaction that fits this description perfectly is: **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂**\n*   This reaction allows us to definitively identify the remaining compounds:\n    *   The reactants are Y (Kr) and **A4 (KrF₄)**.\n    *   The product is **A5 (KrF₂)**. Note that A5 is the same substance as A2 and A3.\n*   The final clue, that A5 (KrF₂) decomposes in water, is also consistent, as krypton difluoride reacts with water to produce krypton, oxygen, and hydrofluoric acid.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Determine the Range**\n\n*   The question asks for the molecular weight range of substance **A4**.\n*   Our analysis has identified **A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)**.\n*   We calculate its molecular weight:\n    *   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of KrF₄ = 83.80 + (4 × 19.00) = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.80 g/mol**.\n\n*   Now, we match this value to the given ranges:\n    *   A) 160-180\n    *   B) 110-130\n    *   C) 220-240\n    *   D) 140-160\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 159.80 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which are potentially misleading or contain inaccuracies, as is common in chemistry olympiad problems. A careful, step-by-step analysis is required to find the most consistent solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of A2\n\nThe most reliable starting point is the quantitative data. Substance A2 is a binary fluoride (YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n\n*   The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n*   Using M(F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol, we can solve for the molar mass of element Y, M(Y):\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test small integer values for 'n':\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for KrF₂ is ~31.2%, which is a reasonable match.\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for SbF₃ is ~31.9%, an almost perfect match.\n*   **n=6**: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Americium (Am, 243 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for AmF₆ is ~31.9%.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Candidates using Other Clues\n\nWe must now use the other clues to determine which candidate (Kr, Sb, or Am) is correct. The most specific and unusual clue is the 1:1 molar reaction.\n\n*   **Clue:** \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n*   **Interpretation:** This describes a comproportionation reaction where the element in its 0 oxidation state (Y) reacts with a compound of the same element in a higher oxidation state (A4) to form a product with an intermediate oxidation state (A5). The key is the **1:1 reactant ratio**.\n\nLet's test our candidates against this clue:\n*   **Antimony (Sb):** The relevant reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. The reactant ratio is 2:3, not 1:1. This hypothesis fails.\n*   **Americium (Am):** The reaction Am + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂ has a 1:1 reactant ratio. This is a perfect fit. This would make A4 = AmF₄. However, the molecular weight of AmF₄ is ~319 g/mol, which is not among the options. This hypothesis, while chemically sound, leads to a dead end.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** The reaction **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂** is a known comproportionation with a **1:1 reactant ratio**. This is a perfect fit for the clue.\n\n### Step 3: Final Identification and Calculation\n\nThe Krypton hypothesis provides the most consistent explanation for the specific reaction stoichiometry, even if it contradicts the qualitative clues about color and the number of compounds (which are likely red herrings).\n\n1.  **Element Y** is **Krypton (Kr)**.\n2.  The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` is `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂`.\n3.  This unambiguously identifies substance **A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)**.\n4.  The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4. We calculate the molecular weight of KrF₄:\n    *   M(KrF₄) = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\n    *   M(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 × 19.00 g/mol\n    *   M(KrF₄) ≈ 159.80 g/mol\n\n5.  Finally, we match this molecular weight to the given ranges:\n    *   **A) 140-160**\n    *   B) 220-240\n    *   C) 110-130\n    *   D) 160-180\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 159.80 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem is a chemical puzzle that requires careful, step-by-step deduction. There are several clues that appear contradictory, which is common in advanced chemistry problems. The key is to identify the most reliable clues and build a consistent hypothesis.\n\nHere is a detailed analysis:\n\n**1. Identifying Element Y**\n\n*   The most quantitative clue is that substance A2 contains 31.96% fluorine (F) by mass. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ.\n*   The molar mass of Y, M(Y), can be related to the number of fluorine atoms, n, using the mass percentage formula:\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n*   Testing integer values for n:\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol).\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol).\n*   Let's check the theoretical mass percentages:\n    *   For KrF₂: %F = (2 * 19.0) / (83.8 + 38.0) ≈ 31.2%. This is a reasonable match.\n    *   For SbF₃: %F = (3 * 19.0) / (121.8 + 57.0) ≈ 31.9%. This is an excellent match.\n*   However, other clues must be considered. The ability of A1 and A3 to oxidize xenon strongly points towards a noble gas compound (like Krypton) or a very high oxidation state metal fluoride (like Pt or Au). Antimony fluorides are not typically strong enough to oxidize xenon under normal conditions. Therefore, **Krypton (Kr) is the most likely candidate for Y**.\n\n**2. Identifying the Compounds based on Y = Krypton**\n\n*   **A2**: Based on the mass percentage, **A2 is KrF₂** (Krypton difluoride).\n*   **A1**: A1 decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine (F₂). This means A1 must be a higher fluoride. The reaction is A1 → KrF₂ + F₂. This identifies **A1 as KrF₄** (Krypton tetrafluoride). The description of A1 as \"bright-red\" and unstable at room temperature (293 K) points to a highly reactive species, consistent with KrF₄, even if the color is a known inaccuracy in this problem.\n*   **The 1:1 Molar Ratio Reaction**: This is the most definitive clue. \"By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to... A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This perfectly describes a comproportionation reaction where the reactants are in a 1:1 ratio. Let's test this:\n    `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂`\n*   This reaction fits the description exactly:\n    *   Reactant 1 is Y (Kr).\n    *   Reactant 2 is A4 (KrF₄).\n    *   The molar ratio of reactants is 1:1.\n    *   The product is A5 (KrF₂).\n*   This allows us to confidently identify **A4 as KrF₄** and **A5 as KrF₂**.\n*   **Final Clues**: The description of A4 as a \"colorless concentrated solution\" is plausible for KrF₄ dissolved in an inert solvent. The final clue that A5 (KrF₂) decomposes in water is also correct.\n\n**3. Calculating the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\n*   The question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4.\n*   We have identified A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n*   Let's calculate its molecular weight:\n    *   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of KrF₄ = 83.80 + (4 × 19.00) = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.80 g/mol**.\n\n**4. Selecting the Correct Range**\n\n*   The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.80 g/mol.\n*   We compare this value to the given options:\n    *   A) 160-180\n    *   B) 220-240\n    *   C) 140-160\n    *   D) 110-130\n*   The value 159.80 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which may be misleading or contain inaccuracies, a common feature in chemistry olympiad questions. A careful, step-by-step analysis is required to find the most plausible solution.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the quantitative clue of mass percentage.**\nSubstance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\nThe molar mass of Y, M(Y), can be related to n (the number of fluorine atoms) by the formula:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\nTesting integer values for n gives us potential candidates for Y:\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. Candidates: Br (79.9), Kr (83.8).\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. Candidate: Sb (121.8).\n*   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol. Candidates: Au (197.0), Pt (195.1).\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. Candidate: Am (243).\n\nLet's calculate the theoretical mass percentages for the most likely compounds:\n*   KrF₂: 31.2%\n*   SbF₃: 31.88%\n*   AuF₅: 32.54%\n*   PtF₅: 32.75%\n*   AmF₆: 31.93%\n\nThe best numerical fits are Americium (Am) and Antimony (Sb). However, we must consider all clues.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the qualitative clues to narrow down Element Y.**\n*   **\"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"** This is a very strong clue.\n    *   Krypton (Kr) and Antimony (Sb) do not fit this well (only 2 stable binary fluorides each).\n    *   Americium (Am) fits perfectly (AmF₂, AmF₃, AmF₄, AmF₅, AmF₆).\n    *   Gold (Au) and Platinum (Pt) also fit if less stable or polymeric species are included.\n*   **\"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\"** This points to an extremely powerful oxidizing agent. The higher fluorides of Kr, Pt, Au, and the actinides (like Am) are known for this property. SbF₅ is a strong Lewis acid but does not oxidize Xe metal. This clue makes Sb a poor candidate.\n*   **\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"** This describes a comproportionation reaction where the reactants Y(0) and A4 (Y in a higher oxidation state) are in a 1:1 molar ratio. The reaction is `Y + YFₙ -> Product`. A balanced reaction with a 1:1 reactant ratio is `Y + YFₙ -> 2YFₙ/₂`. This requires n to be an even number.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the clues to find the most consistent path.**\nLet's evaluate the strongest remaining candidates (Kr, Au, Am, Pt).\n\n*   **Americium (Am) Path:** Fits mass % and \"five compounds\" perfectly. The reaction `Am + AmF₄ -> 2AmF₂` fits the 1:1 ratio. This would make A4 = AmF₄. However, the molecular weight of AmF₄ is ~319 g/mol, which does not match any of the options.\n*   **Krypton (Kr) Path:** The reaction `Kr + KrF₄ -> 2KrF₂` fits the 1:1 ratio. This makes A4 = KrF₄. The molecular weight of KrF₄ is ~159.8 g/mol, which fits option C (140-160). However, this path strongly contradicts the \"five compounds\" clue.\n*   **Gold (Au) Path:** The \"five compounds\" clue is plausible. The mass % for A2=AuF₅ (32.54%) is a reasonable fit. The reaction `Au + AuF₂ -> 2AuF` fits the 1:1 reactant ratio. This would make **A4 = AuF₂**. Let's check the molecular weight of AuF₂.\n    *   M(Au) ≈ 197.0 g/mol\n    *   M(F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol\n    *   MW(AuF₂) = 197.0 + 2 * 19.0 = **235.0 g/mol**.\n    *   This molecular weight falls squarely in the range **A) 220-240**.\n\n**Step 4: Final check of the Gold (Au) hypothesis.**\n*   **Y = Au**.\n*   **Five compounds:** Plausible (AuF, AuF₂, AuF₃, AuF₅, AuF₇-complex).\n*   **A2 = AuF₅:** Fits mass % reasonably well.\n*   **A1:** A higher fluoride (e.g., AuF₇ complex) that decomposes to A2 (AuF₅) and F₂. Fits.\n*   **A1/A3 oxidize Xe:** Higher gold fluorides are exceptionally strong oxidizers. Fits.\n*   **A4 = AuF₂:** MW is ~235 g/mol, which fits option A.\n*   **Reaction:** `Au + A4(AuF₂) -> A5` in a 1:1 ratio. The product A5 would be AuF (from 2AuF). Fits.\n*   **A5 decomposes in water:** AuF is unstable in water. Fits.\n\nThis path provides a consistent solution for all clues, assuming A2 and A4 are different compounds (A2=AuF₅ from mass %, A4=AuF₂ from reaction stoichiometry and MW options). This is the most complete and logical solution among the possibilities.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which may be misleading or contain errors, a common feature in chemistry olympiad problems. A careful, step-by-step analysis is required to find the most consistent solution.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2**\n\nThe most reliable starting point is the quantitative data. Substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ. The molar mass of element Y (Mᵧ) can be related to the number of fluorine atoms (n) using the formula for mass percentage (M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol):\n\nMᵧ ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nTesting integer values for n gives us potential candidates for element Y:\n*   n=2: Mᵧ ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for KrF₂ is ~31.2%, which is a reasonable match.\n*   n=3: Mᵧ ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for SbF₃ is ~31.9%, an excellent match.\n*   n=6: Mᵧ ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to Americium (Am, 243 g/mol) or Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for AmF₆ is ~31.9%, also an excellent match.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Comproportionation Reaction**\n\nClue 7, \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained,\" is the most chemically specific and restrictive clue. It strongly implies a comproportionation reaction where the element in its elemental state reacts with a higher-valent fluoride in a 1:1 ratio. The general form of this reaction is:\nY(0) + Y(+n)Fₙ → 2Y(+n/2)Fₙ/₂\n\nLet's test our best candidates against this clue:\n*   **Antimony (Sb):** The known comproportionation reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. This is not a 1:1 ratio of reactants. This hypothesis fails.\n*   **Americium (Am):** The reaction Am + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂ fits the 1:1 ratio perfectly. This would identify A4 as AmF₄. However, the molecular weight of AmF₄ is ~319 g/mol, which does not fall into any of the provided answer ranges.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** The reaction Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂ also fits the 1:1 ratio perfectly. This identifies **A4 as KrF₄**.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Krypton Hypothesis and Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nLet's assume Y is Krypton and see if the other clues fit, accepting that some descriptive details might be flawed.\n*   **Y = Krypton (Kr)**\n*   **A4 = Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)**\n*   The reaction is Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂. This means **A5 is KrF₂**.\n*   Clue 2 says A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. If we assume A2 is the same as A5 (KrF₂), then A1 must be KrF₄. This is consistent.\n*   Clues 4 & 5 state that A1 (KrF₄) and A3 oxidize xenon. This is a known property of powerful fluorinating agents like krypton fluorides.\n*   Clue 8 states that A5 (KrF₂) decomposes in water. This is also correct.\n*   The clues that do not fit perfectly are the \"five binary compounds\" (Krypton only has two well-established ones) and the \"bright-red\" color of A1 (KrF₄ is a white solid). These are likely inaccuracies in the problem statement.\n\nThe most consistent logical path that incorporates the key chemical reaction and leads to a valid answer is the Krypton hypothesis. The question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4.\n\n*   **A4** is identified as **Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)**.\n*   Calculate its molecular weight:\n    M(KrF₄) = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\n    M(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 × 19.00 g/mol\n    M(KrF₄) ≈ 159.80 g/mol\n\n**Step 4: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 159.80 g/mol falls within the range of **140-160**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which are contradictory or inaccurate, which is common in advanced chemistry problems. The key is to find the most consistent logical path.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of A2**\n\n*   The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96%.\n*   The formula for the molar mass of element Y (M_Y) based on the formula YFₙ is M_Y ≈ 40.45 × n.\n*   Testing integer values for n:\n    *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol).\n    *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol).\n    *   n=6: M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is close to Americium (Am, 243 g/mol).\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Candidates based on Chemical Clues**\n\nWe must evaluate these candidates (Kr, Sb, Am) against the other clues. The most definitive clue is the reaction stoichiometry.\n\n*   **Clue:** \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n*   This describes a comproportionation reaction: Y(0) + A4(YFₙ) → A5. The 1:1 molar ratio of reactants is a very strict constraint.\n\nLet's test the candidates:\n*   **Antimony (Sb):** The known comproportionation is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. The reactant ratio is 2:3, not 1:1. This hypothesis fails.\n*   **Americium (Am):** The reaction Am + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂ has a 1:1 reactant ratio. This is a very strong fit. It would identify A4 as AmF₄. The molecular weight of AmF₄ is ~319 g/mol, which does not fit any of the provided options. This suggests the options are incorrect for this path, or this is not the intended element.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** The reaction Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂ is a known comproportionation. The molar ratio of the reactants, element Y (Kr) and compound A4 (KrF₄), is exactly 1:1. This is a perfect fit for the reaction clue.\n\n**Step 3: Final Identification based on the Krypton Hypothesis**\n\nThe Krypton hypothesis provides the only path that satisfies the unique 1:1 reaction stoichiometry and leads to a molecular weight within the given options. While there are inconsistencies (KrF₄ is not red, and Kr doesn't have five well-established binary fluorides), these are likely deliberate inaccuracies in the problem statement to make it more challenging. The reaction stoichiometry is a much stronger and less ambiguous clue.\n\n1.  **Element Y** is **Krypton (Kr)**.\n2.  **A2** is **KrF₂**. (Calculated ɷF is 31.2%, a reasonable match for 31.96%).\n3.  **A1** decomposes to A2+F₂, so **A1 is KrF₄**.\n4.  The reaction **Y + A4 → A5** is **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂**.\n5.  This uniquely identifies **A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\n*   Substance A4 is KrF₄.\n*   Molar Mass of Kr ≈ 83.80 g/mol.\n*   Molar Mass of F ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n*   Molecular Weight of KrF₄ = 83.80 + (4 × 19.00) = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.80 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Molecular Weight to the Given Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 159.80 g/mol falls within the range:\nA) 140-160\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which appear to be contradictory or contain errors, a common feature in advanced chemistry problems. The most robust method to solve this is to prioritize the quantitative clues (mass percentage, reaction stoichiometry) and use the qualitative clues to select the most plausible candidate.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of A2**\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ.\nThe molar mass of Y, M(Y), can be related to the number of fluorine atoms, n, by the formula:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nLet's test integer values for n:\n*   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (e.g., Ca, Ar) - Unlikely chemistry.\n*   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Br, Se, Kr) - Plausible.\n*   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol (e.g., Sb) - Plausible.\n*   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (e.g., Dy) - Unlikely chemistry.\n*   n = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol (e.g., Au, Pt, Bi) - Plausible.\n*   n = 6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (e.g., Pu, Am) - Plausible.\n\nThe strongest candidates based on their known fluoride chemistry (forming multiple binary compounds, high reactivity) are Krypton (Kr), Antimony (Sb), Gold (Au), Platinum (Pt), and the actinides like Americium (Am).\n\n**Step 2: Use the Reaction Stoichiometry to Identify A4**\n\nThe most specific and unusual clue is the reaction: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThis describes a reaction: **Y + A4 → A5** where the reactants are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\nThis is a perfect description of a comproportionation reaction where an element in its elemental state (Y) reacts with a higher-valent compound of the same element (A4) to form a compound of intermediate valence (A5). The most common form of this reaction is:\n**Y + YF₂ₙ → 2YFₙ**\n\nThis reaction has a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants (Y and YF₂ₙ). This provides a direct link between the compounds.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis**\n\nLet's test this hypothesis, as it provides the most self-consistent solution that matches the given options.\n1.  **Identify Y and A2:** If Y = Krypton (Kr, M ≈ 83.8 g/mol), then for n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is a reasonable fit. So, let's assume **A2 = KrF₂**. The theoretical ɷF in KrF₂ is ~31.2%, which is acceptably close to the given 31.96%.\n2.  **Identify A1:** A1 decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and F₂. This means **A1 = KrF₄**. The fact that A1 is unstable at room temperature (293 K) and oxidizes xenon fits the known properties of KrF₄. The \"bright-red\" color is likely an error in the problem statement, as KrF₄ is a white solid.\n3.  **Apply the Comproportionation Reaction:** The reaction is Y + A4 → A5. Using our model `Y + YF₂ₙ → 2YFₙ`, and knowing the krypton fluorides are KrF₂ and KrF₄, the only possible reaction is:\n    **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂**\n4.  **Identify A4 and A5:** Comparing this to `Y + A4 → A5`, we can identify:\n    *   **Y = Kr**\n    *   **A4 = KrF₄**\n    *   **A5 = KrF₂** (The product is two molecules of KrF₂)\n5.  **Final Check of Clues:** This assignment is consistent. A2 and A5 are the same substance (KrF₂). A1 and A4 are the same substance (KrF₄). The clue about A5 decomposing in water is also true for KrF₂. The main inconsistencies are the \"five compounds\" and \"bright-red\" color, which must be assumed to be errors.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nWe have identified A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n*   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF₄) = 83.80 + 4 × 19.00 = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.80 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 159.80 g/mol falls within the range of **140-160**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem is a chemical puzzle that requires careful deduction, prioritizing the most reliable clues while acknowledging potential inaccuracies in the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Quantitative Clue to Identify Element Y**\n\nThe most reliable piece of information is the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in compound A2, given as 31.96%.\nLet the formula of A2 be YFₙ. The molar mass of Y, M(Y), can be related to the number of fluorine atoms, n, using the formula for mass percentage (M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol):\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nTesting integer values for n:\n*   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (e.g., Ca, Ar)\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Br, Se, Kr)\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (e.g., Sb)\n\nThe problem describes compounds that can oxidize xenon (A1, A3), which is a hallmark of extremely powerful oxidizing agents, most famously the fluorides of noble gases like Krypton. Let's test the Krypton (Kr, M ≈ 83.8 g/mol) hypothesis.\nIf Y = Kr and n=2, then A2 = KrF₂.\nThe theoretical ɷF in KrF₂ is (2 × 19.00) / (83.8 + 38.0) ≈ 31.2%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96% and is the most plausible fit given the chemical context.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Compounds using the Reaction Clues**\n\nWith Y = Krypton (Kr) and A2 = KrF₂, we can decipher the other compounds:\n*   **A1:** The decomposition `A1 → A2 + F₂` becomes `A1 → KrF₂ + F₂`. This implies **A1 = KrF₄**. The description of A1 as \"bright-red\" is likely an inaccuracy, as KrF₄ is a white solid, but its extreme reactivity and instability fit the other clues.\n*   **A4 and A5:** This is the key step. The reaction is `Y + A4 → A5` with a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants. Substituting our identified element Y:\n    `Kr + A4 → A5`\n    This strongly suggests a comproportionation reaction, where an element in different oxidation states reacts to form a product in an intermediate state. The most elegant interpretation is:\n    `Kr(0) + KrF₄(+4) → 2KrF₂(+2)`\n    This reaction perfectly matches the 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants (Y and A4).\n    This identifies **A4 as KrF₄** and A5 as KrF₂.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Determine the Range**\n\nWe have identified substance A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n*   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n\nMolecular Weight of A4 (KrF₄) = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\nMW(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 + 4 × 19.00\nMW(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 + 76.00\nMW(KrF₄) ≈ 159.80 g/mol\n\n**Step 4: Match the Result to the Given Options**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.80 g/mol. We compare this to the given ranges:\nA) 110-130\nB) 140-160\nC) 220-240\nD) 160-180\n\nThe value 159.80 g/mol falls squarely within the range **140-160**.\n\nThis line of reasoning, primarily followed by candidate answers 1 and 5, provides the most coherent and chemically sound solution, successfully integrating all the major clues despite minor descriptive inaccuracies in the problem statement.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which are contradictory, a common feature in advanced chemistry problems designed to test deductive reasoning. A step-by-step analysis is required to find the most plausible path to the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2**\n\nThe most crucial quantitative clue is that substance A2 contains 31.96% fluorine (F) by mass. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of F is ~19.0 g/mol.\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F)).\nRearranging to solve for the molar mass of Y gives: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n.\n\nWe can test integer values for 'n' to find candidate elements for Y:\n*   **n=2:** M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for KrF₂ is ~31.2%. This is a reasonable fit.\n*   **n=3:** M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is extremely close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for SbF₃ is ~31.9%. This is an excellent fit.\n*   **n=5:** M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol. This is close to Gold (Au, 197.0 g/mol) and Platinum (Pt, 195.1 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for AuF₅ is ~32.5%. This is also a reasonable fit.\n*   **n=6:** M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is extremely close to Americium (Am, 243 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for AmF₆ is ~31.93%. This is an excellent fit.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Candidates Against Other Clues**\n\nWe must use the other clues to eliminate candidates. The most discriminating clues are the existence of five binary fluorides, the \"bright-red\" color of A1, the ability to oxidize xenon, and the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry.\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb):** While the mass percentage is a great fit, this path fails on multiple counts. Antimony only forms two stable binary fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅), not five. SbF₅ (which would be A1) is a colorless liquid, not a bright-red solid. The 1:1 reaction stoichiometry is not observed in its comproportionation reactions.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** This path has a reasonable mass % fit and explains the decomposition of A1 (KrF₄ → KrF₂). However, it fails on key points: only two binary fluorides are well-known, not five, and KrF₄ is a white solid, not red.\n*   **Americium (Am):** This path is almost perfect. It fits the mass percentage, the existence of five fluorides, and all reaction chemistry. However, the calculated molecular weight for A4 (AmF₄, MW ≈ 319 g/mol) does not fall into any of the provided options, suggesting this is not the intended answer for this multiple-choice question.\n*   **Gold (Au):** This path is very strong.\n    *   **Five binary compounds:** Gold is known to form several fluorides (AuF, AuF₃, AuF₅) and related species, making \"five\" plausible in a puzzle context.\n    *   **Color and Oxidation:** A1 is \"bright-red\" and oxidizes xenon. Gold(V) fluoride (AuF₅) is a red solid and an extremely powerful oxidizing agent. This fits well. If A2 is AuF₅, then A1 is a higher, unstable fluoride that decomposes to it.\n    *   **Mass Percentage:** The mass % of F in AuF₅ (~32.5%) is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **1:1 Reaction:** The clue is `Y + A4 -> A5` in a 1:1 molar ratio. This can be interpreted as a comproportionation reaction. Let's test the gold fluorides as A4 to see if any fit the options. The known fluorides are AuF, AuF₃, and AuF₅. A hypothetical AuF₂ is also sometimes discussed.\n        *   MW(AuF) ≈ 216 g/mol\n        *   **MW(AuF₂) ≈ 235 g/mol**\n        *   MW(AuF₃) ≈ 254 g/mol\n        *   MW(AuF₅) ≈ 292 g/mol\n    *   The molecular weight of AuF₂ (~235 g/mol) falls squarely in the range **D) 220-240**.\n    *   If we assume **A4 is AuF₂**, the reaction `Au + AuF₂ → 2AuF` has a 1:1 reactant ratio and produces A5 = AuF. This is a chemically sound comproportionation. The final clue, that A5 (AuF) decomposes in water, is also correct.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe hypothesis that Y is Gold (Au) provides the most consistent solution that aligns with the chemical properties described and leads to one of the provided numerical answers.\n\n*   **Element Y:** Gold (Au)\n*   **A1:** A higher, unstable fluoride of gold (e.g., AuF₇ complex).\n*   **A2:** AuF₅ (fits mass % and is the decomposition product of A1).\n*   **A3:** AuF₅ (powerful oxidant formed from fluorinating gold).\n*   **A4:** AuF₂ (based on its molecular weight fitting an option and its role in a plausible 1:1 reaction).\n*   **A5:** AuF (product of the 1:1 reaction, decomposes in water).\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (AuF₂) is calculated as:\nMW(AuF₂) = MW(Au) + 2 × MW(F) ≈ 197.0 + 2 × 19.0 = **235.0 g/mol**.\n\nThis value falls within the range of 220-240 g/mol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which appear contradictory. A careful, step-by-step analysis is required to find the most logical solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of A2**\n\nThe most crucial quantitative clue is that substance A2 contains 31.96% fluorine (F) by mass. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine is ~19.00 g/mol.\n\nThe formula for the mass percentage of fluorine is:\nɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\nRearranging to solve for the molar mass of Y, M(Y), gives the relationship:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe can test integer values for 'n' to find plausible elements:\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8) or Bromine (Br, 79.9).\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Antimony (Sb, 121.8).\n*   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol. This is reasonably close to Platinum (Pt, 195.1) or Gold (Au, 197.0).\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Americium (Am, 243) or Plutonium (Pu, 244).\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Candidates using Other Clues**\n\nWe must use the other clues to narrow down the possibilities. The clues about \"five binary compounds\" and the ability to \"oxidize xenon\" are particularly restrictive.\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb) and Krypton (Kr)** are poor candidates because they are not known to form five distinct binary fluorides, which contradicts a key premise of the problem.\n*   **Americium (Am)** is an excellent candidate. It forms five binary fluorides (AmF₂ to AmF₆), its higher fluorides are powerful oxidizers, and its chemistry fits the unique 1:1 reaction clue perfectly. However, this path leads to a molecular weight for A4 (~319 g/mol) that does not match any of the options, suggesting a flaw in the problem's options.\n*   **Platinum (Pt) and Gold (Au)** remain strong candidates. Both form multiple binary fluorides (fulfilling the \"five compounds\" clue) and their higher fluorides (like PtF₆ and AuF₅) are famously powerful oxidizing agents capable of reacting with xenon.\n\n**Step 3: Follow the Gold (Au) Hypothesis**\n\nThe Gold hypothesis provides the most consistent explanation that leads to one of the provided answers.\n\n1.  **Element Y is Gold (Au).**\n2.  **Five binary compounds**: Gold's known or theoretical binary fluorides (AuF, AuF₂, AuF₃, AuF₅, AuF₇-complex) fit this clue.\n3.  **A2 (ɷF=31.96%)**: If A2 is AuF₅, its fluorine percentage is ~32.5%. This is a reasonable match for a puzzle of this type.\n4.  **A1**: A higher, unstable fluoride like the AuF₇ complex would decompose to A2 (AuF₅), be highly reactive (oxidize xenon), and could be colored. This fits the description.\n5.  **A3**: This would also be AuF₅, a powerful oxidizing agent formed from fluorinating gold.\n6.  **A4 and the 1:1 Reaction**: The reaction is Y + A4 → A5 in a 1:1 molar ratio. If we hypothesize that **A4 is AuF₂**, the reaction becomes **Au + AuF₂ → 2AuF**. This reaction has a 1:1 reactant ratio and produces A5 = AuF. Gold(I) fluoride (AuF) is known to be unstable and would decompose in water, fitting the final clue.\n7.  **Molecular Weight of A4**: The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4. We have identified A4 as Gold(II) fluoride, AuF₂.\n    *   Molar Mass of Au ≈ 197.0 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of F ≈ 19.0 g/mol\n    *   MW(AuF₂) = 197.0 + (2 × 19.0) = 197.0 + 38.0 = **235.0 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 4: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 (AuF₂) is 235.0 g/mol. This value falls squarely within the range:\n\nA) 220-240\n\nThis pathway provides a coherent explanation for all the clues in the problem while leading to one of the given options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which are intentionally misleading or contain factual inaccuracies, which is common in advanced chemistry olympiad questions. A careful, step-by-step analysis is required to find the most consistent solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element Y**\n\nThe most reliable piece of information is the quantitative data: substance A2 contains 31.96% fluorine by mass (ɷF). Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ.\n\n*   The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F)), where M(F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol.\n*   Rearranging to solve for the molar mass of element Y, M(Y), gives the relation: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n.\n*   We test small integer values for n:\n    *   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This atomic mass is very close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol). The chemistry of a noble gas fits the clue that its compounds can oxidize xenon. Let's check the theoretical mass percentage for KrF₂: ɷF = (2 * 19) / (83.8 + 38) ≈ 31.2%. This is a reasonable match to the given 31.96%.\n    *   If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol). The theoretical mass percentage for SbF₃ is ≈ 31.9%. While the number is a better fit, the chemistry is not. Antimony fluorides are not known to oxidize xenon under normal conditions, which contradicts a key clue.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible candidate for **element Y is Krypton (Kr)**, and **A2 is Krypton difluoride (KrF₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Other Substances based on Y = Kr**\n\n*   **A1**: This substance decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine (F₂). This implies the reaction is A1 → KrF₂ + F₂. By conservation of mass, **A1 must be Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)**. KrF₄ is known to be highly unstable and decomposes at room temperature (293 K), fitting the description. The \"bright-red\" color is a known inaccuracy in this problem statement; KrF₄ is a white solid.\n*   **A3**: This is another krypton fluoride that oxidizes xenon. This could be KrF₂ or KrF₄.\n*   **A4 and A5**: This is the crucial step. A5 is obtained by adding Y (Kr) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. This describes the reaction:\n    Kr + A4 → A5 (Reactant ratio is 1:1)\n\n    This is a classic comproportionation reaction, where an element in different oxidation states reacts to form a product in an intermediate state. The most logical reaction involving known krypton fluorides is:\n    Kr(0) + KrF₄(+4) → 2KrF₂(+2)\n\n    This reaction perfectly matches the 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants (one mole of Kr reacts with one mole of KrF₄). This allows us to definitively identify the substances:\n    *   **A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).**\n    *   **A5 is Krypton difluoride (KrF₂).**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nThe question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4. We have identified A4 as KrF₄.\n\n*   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol.\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF₄) = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\n*   MW(KrF₄) = 83.80 + 4 × 19.00 = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.80 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 4: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.80 g/mol. We compare this value to the given options:\n\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 140-160\nD) 110-130\n\nThe value 159.80 g/mol falls within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis is a complex chemistry puzzle with several clues, some of which are potentially misleading or contain errors, a common feature in chemistry olympiad-style problems. A careful step-by-step analysis is required, prioritizing the most reliable chemical and quantitative information.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2**\n\nThe most reliable piece of information is usually quantitative. We are given that substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (formula YFₙ) and has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n\n*   The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n*   Using M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol, we can solve for M(Y): M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n.\n\nLet's test integer values for n:\n*   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (e.g., Ca, Ar - chemistry doesn't fit).\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Br, Kr).\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol (e.g., Sb).\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (e.g., Am, Pu).\n\nThe best numerical matches are for Antimony (SbF₃, ɷF=31.88%) and Americium (AmF₆, ɷF=31.93%). However, we must consider all clues.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Stoichiometry**\n\nThe most unique and restrictive clue is the reaction: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\nThis describes a comproportionation reaction where the element in its elemental state (Y) reacts with a higher fluoride of the same element (A4) to produce a fluoride with an intermediate oxidation state (A5). The 1:1 molar ratio of reactants is a critical constraint.\n\nLet's test the most plausible candidate elements against this clue:\n*   **Antimony (Sb):** The known comproportionation is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. The reactant ratio is 2:3, not 1:1. This hypothesis fails.\n*   **Americium (Am):** The reaction `Am + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂` has a 1:1 reactant ratio. This is a strong fit. However, the molecular weight of A4 (AmF₄) would be ~319 g/mol, which is not among the options.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** The reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂` is a known comproportionation with a 1:1 reactant ratio. This is a perfect fit for the description.\n\n**Step 3: Build a Consistent Hypothesis around Krypton**\n\nThe perfect fit for the 1:1 reaction makes Krypton the most likely intended element, despite some inconsistencies in other clues.\n\n*   **Element Y = Krypton (Kr)**.\n*   **A2 = KrF₂**. The theoretical ɷF is ~31.2%, which is acceptably close to 31.96% for this type of problem.\n*   **A1 → A2 + F₂**: This implies the reaction is `KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂`. Thus, **A1 = KrF₄**. The description of A1 as \"bright-red\" and unstable at 293 K fits the high reactivity of KrF₄, even if the color is inaccurate (it's a white solid). Its ability to oxidize xenon is also correct.\n*   **Y + A4 → A5 (1:1 ratio)**: As established, this is the reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂`.\n*   From this reaction, we can identify the reactants and product:\n    *   Y = Kr\n    *   **A4 = KrF₄**\n    *   A5 = KrF₂\n*   **A5 decomposes in water**: KrF₂ does indeed decompose in water (`2KrF₂ + 2H₂O → 2Kr + O₂ + 4HF`), which fits the final clue.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nWe have confidently identified substance A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n\n*   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF₄) = 83.80 + (4 × 19.00) = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.80 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 159.80 g/mol falls within the range given in option A.\n\n*   **A) 140-160**\n*   B) 110-130\n*   C) 160-180\n*   D) 220-240\n\nThe Krypton hypothesis is the only one that provides a consistent explanation for the most complex and specific chemical reaction described in the problem, leading to a definitive answer among the options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which are contradictory or potentially erroneous. A careful step-by-step analysis is required to find the most plausible solution by prioritizing the most reliable information.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of A2**\n\nThe most reliable clue is the quantitative data: substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ.\n\n*   The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M_F) / (M_Y + n × M_F)\n*   Using M_F ≈ 19.0 g/mol, we can solve for the molar mass of Y (M_Y):\n    M_Y ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test integer values for 'n':\n*   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol).\n*   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol).\n*   n=6: M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to Americium (Am, 243 g/mol) or Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol).\n\nThe description of compounds that can oxidize xenon strongly suggests a noble gas or a very high-oxidation-state metal fluoride. Krypton is a strong candidate. Let's check the theoretical mass percentage for KrF₂:\nɷF(KrF₂) = (2 × 19.0) / (83.8 + 38.0) ≈ 31.2%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Stoichiometry**\n\nThe most unique and restrictive clue is the reaction: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\n*   This describes a reaction where the reactants are Y and A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   This strongly suggests a comproportionation reaction, where an element in its zero oxidation state reacts with a compound of the same element in a higher oxidation state.\n*   If we assume Y is Krypton (Kr), the reaction is: Kr + A4 → A5.\n*   For this to be a comproportionation, A4 must be a higher fluoride of krypton. The only other known binary fluoride is KrF₄.\n*   Let's test the reaction: **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂**\n*   This reaction has a **perfect 1:1 molar ratio** of the reactants (Kr and KrF₄). This is a very strong confirmation of this chemical pathway.\n\n**Step 3: Identify all Substances and Verify Clues**\n\nBased on the Krypton hypothesis, which uniquely satisfies the 1:1 reaction clue:\n*   **Element Y:** Krypton (Kr).\n*   **A2:** KrF₂ (from the mass percentage and the reaction product).\n*   **A1:** The problem states A1 decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine. This identifies **A1 as KrF₄**.\n*   **A4:** The reaction is Kr + A4 → A5. We identified this as Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂. Therefore, **A4 is KrF₄**.\n*   **A5:** The product of the reaction is KrF₂. So, **A5 is KrF₂**.\n\nLet's check the remaining clues with this assignment:\n*   \"Five binary compounds\": This is a known inaccuracy in this famous problem. Krypton only forms two well-established binary fluorides. We must assume this clue is an error.\n*   \"A1 is bright-red\": KrF₄ is a white solid. This is also likely an error in the problem statement.\n*   \"A1 and A3 oxidize xenon\": KrF₄ and KrF₂ are extremely powerful oxidizing agents and would react with xenon. This is consistent.\n*   \"A4 is in a hot colorless concentrated solution\": KrF₄ is a colorless solid, and its solution in a suitable inert solvent (like anhydrous HF) would be colorless. This is plausible.\n*   \"A5 decomposes in water\": A5 is KrF₂. It reacts with water (2KrF₂ + 2H₂O → 2Kr + O₂ + 4HF). This fits the description.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nThe question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4. We have confidently identified A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n\n*   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF₄) = 83.80 + 4 × 19.00 = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.80 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Molecular Weight to the Given Ranges**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 159.80 g/mol falls within the range:\nA) 140-160\n\nThis solution is the most coherent, as it correctly interprets the most specific and unusual chemical clue (the 1:1 comproportionation reaction), while only needing to dismiss the less reliable qualitative descriptors which are likely errors in the problem statement.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which are potentially misleading. A careful, step-by-step analysis is required to find the most consistent solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the unknown element Y.**\nThe most crucial quantitative clue is that substance A2 contains 31.96% fluorine by mass (ɷF). We can establish a relationship between the molar mass of element Y (M(Y)) and the number of fluorine atoms (n) in the compound A2 (formula YFₙ).\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F)).\nUsing M(F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol and ɷF = 0.3196, we can solve for M(Y):\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test integer values for n:\n*   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (e.g., Ca, Ar). The chemistry described (oxidizing xenon) does not fit.\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol). Noble gases are known to form highly oxidizing fluorides. This is a strong candidate.\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol). While the mass percentage for SbF₃ is a near-perfect match (31.88%), its chemistry does not fully align with all the clues.\n*   n=4 or higher: Leads to other elements, but the Krypton hypothesis proves to be the most consistent.\n\nLet's proceed with **Y = Krypton (Kr)**.\n*   If Y=Kr, then A2 must be KrF₂. The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in KrF₂ is (2 * 19.0) / (83.8 + 38.0) ≈ 31.2%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the other compounds based on Y=Kr.**\n*   **A2 = KrF₂** (Krypton difluoride).\n*   **A1**: A bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (room temperature) into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine. The reaction is A1 → KrF₂ + F₂. This identifies **A1 as KrF₄** (Krypton tetrafluoride). KrF₄ is known to be highly unstable and decomposes at room temperature. It is also a powerful oxidizing agent capable of reacting with xenon. The \"bright-red\" color is a known inaccuracy or red herring in this classic problem; KrF₄ is a white solid.\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorinating Kr and also oxidizes xenon. This could be KrF₂ or KrF₄.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the key reaction to identify A4.**\nThis is the most decisive clue: \"By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\nThis describes a comproportionation reaction where Krypton in its elemental state (Kr, oxidation state 0) reacts with a Krypton compound of a higher oxidation state (A4) to form a product of an intermediate state (A5).\n\nThe reaction is: **Kr + A4 → A5** (with a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants).\n\nThe only known reaction that perfectly fits this description is:\n**Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂**\n\nLet's map this to the problem's variables:\n*   Y = Kr\n*   A4 = KrF₄\n*   A5 = KrF₂\n\nThis interpretation is chemically sound and elegantly satisfies the 1:1 ratio constraint.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of A4 and find the correct range.**\nBased on the analysis, substance A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n\n*   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF₄) = 83.80 + (4 × 19.00) = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.80 g/mol**.\n\nNow, we compare this value to the given ranges:\nA) 220-240\nB) 160-180\nC) 110-130\nD) 140-160\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 159.80 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "This is a complex chemical puzzle where the most reliable path to the solution involves prioritizing the quantitative and stoichiometric clues over the qualitative descriptions, which may contain inaccuracies.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. We can establish a relationship between the molar mass of Y, M(Y), and the number of fluorine atoms, n, using the mass percentage formula (M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol):\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\n    Testing small integer values for n gives us potential candidates for Y:\n    *   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol). The chemistry of a noble gas fits the clue that its compounds can oxidize xenon. The theoretical mass percentage for KrF₂ is ~31.2%, which is a reasonable match for the given 31.96%.\n    *   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol). However, antimony fluorides do not typically oxidize xenon, which contradicts a key clue.\n\n    Based on the combination of mass percentage and chemical reactivity (oxidizing xenon), **Krypton (Kr)** is the most plausible candidate for element Y.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1:1 Molar Ratio Reaction.**\n    This is the most specific and restrictive clue in the problem: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    This describes the reaction: **Y + A4 → A5** (with a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants).\n\n    This is a classic comproportionation reaction, where an element in its elemental state (oxidation state 0) reacts with a compound of the same element in a higher oxidation state. For Krypton, the only known reaction that perfectly fits this 1:1 stoichiometry is:\n    **Kr(0) + KrF₄(+4) → 2KrF₂(+2)**\n\n3.  **Identify A4 and Verify the Hypothesis.**\n    By mapping the known reaction to the problem's variables, we can make definitive identifications:\n    *   Y = Kr\n    *   **A4 = KrF₄** (Krypton tetrafluoride)\n    *   A5 = KrF₂ (Krypton difluoride)\n\n    Let's check this against the other clues:\n    *   **A1**: Decomposes into A2 and F₂. If A2 is KrF₂, then A1 must be KrF₄. This is consistent.\n    *   **Inconsistencies**: The clues that Krypton has \"five binary compounds\" and that A1 (KrF₄) is \"bright-red\" are known inaccuracies in this classic problem. KrF₄ is a white solid, and only two binary fluorides are well-established. In chemical puzzles, specific stoichiometric clues are far more reliable than qualitative descriptions.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    The question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4.

To find the most likely answer, we must evaluate the different hypotheses presented by the agents and identify the one that provides the most coherent explanation.\n\n### Analysis of Hypotheses\n\n1.  **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis (Answers 1, 3, 4, 5, 11):**\n    *   **Pros:** Krypton's chemistry involves highly reactive, unstable fluorides that can oxidize xenon. The mass percentage of fluorine in KrF₂ (~31.2%) is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **Cons:** Krypton only has two well-established binary fluorides (KrF₂ and KrF₄), which contradicts the \"five binary compounds\" clue. Also, KrF₄ is a white solid, not \"bright-red\". This hypothesis requires ignoring several key clues.\n\n2.  **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis (Answers 2, 6, 8, 12, 13):**\n    *   **Pros:** The mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ (31.89%) is an excellent match for the given 31.96%.\n    *   **Cons:** Antimony only has two common binary fluorides (SbF₃ and SbF₅), contradicting the \"five compounds\" clue. The comproportionation reaction `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃` does not have the 1:1 molar ratio described. This hypothesis fails on major structural clues.\n\n3.  **Americium (Am) Hypothesis (Answer 7):**\n    *   **Pros:** This hypothesis is chemically very strong. Americium is known to form five binary fluorides. The mass percentage of fluorine in AmF₆ (31.93%) is an almost perfect match. The reaction chemistry, including the 1:1 comproportionation, can be explained consistently.\n    *   **Cons:** The derived molecular weight for A4 (AmF₄) is ~319 g/mol, which does not fall into any of the provided answer ranges. This suggests the options are flawed, but we must choose from them.\n\n4.  **Gold (Au) Hypothesis (Answer 10):**\n    *   **Pros:** This hypothesis provides the best balance of satisfying all clues while leading to one of the given options.\n        *   **\"Five binary compounds\":** Gold is known to form multiple fluorides (AuF, AuF₂, AuF₃, AuF₅, and a complex sometimes denoted AuF₇), making this plausible.\n        *   **\"Oxidizes xenon\":** Higher gold fluorides like AuF₅ are extremely powerful oxidizing agents.\n        *   **\"Bright-red substance\":** AuF₅ is a red solid.\n        *   **Mass Percentage:** The fluorine percentage in AuF₅ (~32.5%) is a reasonable match for A2 (31.96%).\n        *   **1:1 Reaction:** The comproportionation reaction `Au + AuF₂ → 2AuF` has a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants (Y and A4). This identifies **A4 as AuF₂**.\n        *   **Molecular Weight:** The molecular weight of A4 (AuF₂) is calculated as 197.0 (Au) + 2 * 19.0 (F) = **235.0 g/mol**. This value fits perfectly within the **220-240** range.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the problem is flawed, the Gold (Au) hypothesis provides the most comprehensive and consistent explanation. It satisfies the difficult qualitative clues (five compounds, color, reactivity) and the quantitative reaction stoichiometry, while leading directly to one of the numerical answer choices. The slight discrepancy in the mass percentage is a minor issue compared to the major contradictions in the other hypotheses.\n\nTherefore, the most logical conclusion is that A4 is AuF₂, and its molecular weight falls in the 220-240 range.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle that requires careful, step-by-step deduction. Many of the clues are qualitative and can be misleading, so it is crucial to ground the analysis in the quantitative data provided.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2**\n\n*   The problem states that substance A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n*   The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F)), where M(Y) is the molar mass of Y, M(F) is the molar mass of F (≈19.00 g/mol), and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n*   Rearranging the formula to solve for M(Y) gives the relationship: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n.\n*   We test small integer values for n:\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.5 g/mol (e.g., Ca, Ar)\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Br, Se, Kr)\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol (e.g., Sb)\n*   The clues about compounds oxidizing xenon under normal conditions strongly point to a noble gas or a highly electronegative element. Krypton (Kr, M=83.8 g/mol) is an excellent candidate. If Y is Kr and n=2, the theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in KrF₂ is (2 × 19.00) / (83.8 + 38.0) ≈ 31.2%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96% and is the most plausible fit given the chemical context.\n*   Therefore, we can tentatively identify **Y as Krypton (Kr)** and **A2 as Krypton difluoride (KrF₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Other Compounds based on the Krypton Hypothesis**\n\n*   **A1:** A1 decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine (F₂). This implies A1 is a higher fluoride of krypton. The reaction is A1 → KrF₂ + F₂. This identifies **A1 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)**. The description of A1 as \"bright-red\" and decomposing at room temperature (293 K) fits the profile of a highly unstable, reactive compound like KrF₄ (though KrF₄ is typically described as a white solid, such discrepancies are common in puzzle-like problems).\n*   **A3:** A3 is formed by fluorinating Y (Kr) and also oxidizes xenon. This describes KrF₂, which is formed from Kr + F₂ and is a powerful oxidizing agent. So, A3 is also KrF₂.\n*   **A4 and A5:** This is the crucial step. The reaction is described as adding Y (Kr) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio to obtain A5.\n    *   Reaction: **Kr + A4 → A5** (1:1 molar ratio of reactants)\n    *   This is a classic comproportionation reaction, where an element in its zero oxidation state (Kr) reacts with a compound of the same element in a higher oxidation state (A4) to form a product with an intermediate oxidation state (A5).\n    *   The only known reaction that fits this description perfectly is: **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂**\n*   This reaction allows us to definitively identify the remaining compounds:\n    *   The reactants are Y (Kr) and **A4 (KrF₄)**.\n    *   The product is **A5 (KrF₂)**. Note that A5 is the same substance as A2 and A3.\n*   The final clue, that A5 (KrF₂) decomposes in water, is also consistent, as krypton difluoride reacts with water to produce krypton, oxygen, and hydrofluoric acid.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Determine the Range**\n\n*   The question asks for the molecular weight range of substance **A4**.\n*   Our analysis has identified **A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)**.\n*   We calculate its molecular weight:\n    *   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of KrF₄ = 83.80 + (4 × 19.00) = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.80 g/mol**.\n\n*   Now, we match this value to the given ranges:\n    *   A) 160-180\n    *   B) 110-130\n    *   C) 220-240\n    *   D) 140-160\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 159.80 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which are potentially misleading or contain inaccuracies, as is common in chemistry olympiad problems. A careful, step-by-step analysis is required to find the most consistent solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of A2\n\nThe most reliable starting point is the quantitative data. Substance A2 is a binary fluoride (YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n\n*   The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n*   Using M(F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol, we can solve for the molar mass of element Y, M(Y):\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test small integer values for 'n':\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for KrF₂ is ~31.2%, which is a reasonable match.\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for SbF₃ is ~31.9%, an almost perfect match.\n*   **n=6**: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Americium (Am, 243 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for AmF₆ is ~31.9%.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Candidates using Other Clues\n\nWe must now use the other clues to determine which candidate (Kr, Sb, or Am) is correct. The most specific and unusual clue is the 1:1 molar reaction.\n\n*   **Clue:** \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n*   **Interpretation:** This describes a comproportionation reaction where the element in its 0 oxidation state (Y) reacts with a compound of the same element in a higher oxidation state (A4) to form a product with an intermediate oxidation state (A5). The key is the **1:1 reactant ratio**.\n\nLet's test our candidates against this clue:\n*   **Antimony (Sb):** The relevant reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. The reactant ratio is 2:3, not 1:1. This hypothesis fails.\n*   **Americium (Am):** The reaction Am + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂ has a 1:1 reactant ratio. This is a perfect fit. This would make A4 = AmF₄. However, the molecular weight of AmF₄ is ~319 g/mol, which is not among the options. This hypothesis, while chemically sound, leads to a dead end.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** The reaction **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂** is a known comproportionation with a **1:1 reactant ratio**. This is a perfect fit for the clue.\n\n### Step 3: Final Identification and Calculation\n\nThe Krypton hypothesis provides the most consistent explanation for the specific reaction stoichiometry, even if it contradicts the qualitative clues about color and the number of compounds (which are likely red herrings).\n\n1.  **Element Y** is **Krypton (Kr)**.\n2.  The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` is `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂`.\n3.  This unambiguously identifies substance **A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)**.\n4.  The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4. We calculate the molecular weight of KrF₄:\n    *   M(KrF₄) = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\n    *   M(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 × 19.00 g/mol\n    *   M(KrF₄) ≈ 159.80 g/mol\n\n5.  Finally, we match this molecular weight to the given ranges:\n    *   **A) 140-160**\n    *   B) 220-240\n    *   C) 110-130\n    *   D) 160-180\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 159.80 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem is a chemical puzzle that requires careful, step-by-step deduction. There are several clues that appear contradictory, which is common in advanced chemistry problems. The key is to identify the most reliable clues and build a consistent hypothesis.\n\nHere is a detailed analysis:\n\n**1. Identifying Element Y**\n\n*   The most quantitative clue is that substance A2 contains 31.96% fluorine (F) by mass. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ.\n*   The molar mass of Y, M(Y), can be related to the number of fluorine atoms, n, using the mass percentage formula:\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n*   Testing integer values for n:\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol).\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol).\n*   Let's check the theoretical mass percentages:\n    *   For KrF₂: %F = (2 * 19.0) / (83.8 + 38.0) ≈ 31.2%. This is a reasonable match.\n    *   For SbF₃: %F = (3 * 19.0) / (121.8 + 57.0) ≈ 31.9%. This is an excellent match.\n*   However, other clues must be considered. The ability of A1 and A3 to oxidize xenon strongly points towards a noble gas compound (like Krypton) or a very high oxidation state metal fluoride (like Pt or Au). Antimony fluorides are not typically strong enough to oxidize xenon under normal conditions. Therefore, **Krypton (Kr) is the most likely candidate for Y**.\n\n**2. Identifying the Compounds based on Y = Krypton**\n\n*   **A2**: Based on the mass percentage, **A2 is KrF₂** (Krypton difluoride).\n*   **A1**: A1 decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine (F₂). This means A1 must be a higher fluoride. The reaction is A1 → KrF₂ + F₂. This identifies **A1 as KrF₄** (Krypton tetrafluoride). The description of A1 as \"bright-red\" and unstable at room temperature (293 K) points to a highly reactive species, consistent with KrF₄, even if the color is a known inaccuracy in this problem.\n*   **The 1:1 Molar Ratio Reaction**: This is the most definitive clue. \"By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to... A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This perfectly describes a comproportionation reaction where the reactants are in a 1:1 ratio. Let's test this:\n    `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂`\n*   This reaction fits the description exactly:\n    *   Reactant 1 is Y (Kr).\n    *   Reactant 2 is A4 (KrF₄).\n    *   The molar ratio of reactants is 1:1.\n    *   The product is A5 (KrF₂).\n*   This allows us to confidently identify **A4 as KrF₄** and **A5 as KrF₂**.\n*   **Final Clues**: The description of A4 as a \"colorless concentrated solution\" is plausible for KrF₄ dissolved in an inert solvent. The final clue that A5 (KrF₂) decomposes in water is also correct.\n\n**3. Calculating the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\n*   The question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4.\n*   We have identified A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n*   Let's calculate its molecular weight:\n    *   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of KrF₄ = 83.80 + (4 × 19.00) = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.80 g/mol**.\n\n**4. Selecting the Correct Range**\n\n*   The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.80 g/mol.\n*   We compare this value to the given options:\n    *   A) 160-180\n    *   B) 220-240\n    *   C) 140-160\n    *   D) 110-130\n*   The value 159.80 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which may be misleading or contain inaccuracies, a common feature in chemistry olympiad questions. A careful, step-by-step analysis is required to find the most plausible solution.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the quantitative clue of mass percentage.**\nSubstance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\nThe molar mass of Y, M(Y), can be related to n (the number of fluorine atoms) by the formula:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\nTesting integer values for n gives us potential candidates for Y:\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. Candidates: Br (79.9), Kr (83.8).\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. Candidate: Sb (121.8).\n*   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol. Candidates: Au (197.0), Pt (195.1).\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. Candidate: Am (243).\n\nLet's calculate the theoretical mass percentages for the most likely compounds:\n*   KrF₂: 31.2%\n*   SbF₃: 31.88%\n*   AuF₅: 32.54%\n*   PtF₅: 32.75%\n*   AmF₆: 31.93%\n\nThe best numerical fits are Americium (Am) and Antimony (Sb). However, we must consider all clues.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the qualitative clues to narrow down Element Y.**\n*   **\"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"** This is a very strong clue.\n    *   Krypton (Kr) and Antimony (Sb) do not fit this well (only 2 stable binary fluorides each).\n    *   Americium (Am) fits perfectly (AmF₂, AmF₃, AmF₄, AmF₅, AmF₆).\n    *   Gold (Au) and Platinum (Pt) also fit if less stable or polymeric species are included.\n*   **\"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\"** This points to an extremely powerful oxidizing agent. The higher fluorides of Kr, Pt, Au, and the actinides (like Am) are known for this property. SbF₅ is a strong Lewis acid but does not oxidize Xe metal. This clue makes Sb a poor candidate.\n*   **\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"** This describes a comproportionation reaction where the reactants Y(0) and A4 (Y in a higher oxidation state) are in a 1:1 molar ratio. The reaction is `Y + YFₙ -> Product`. A balanced reaction with a 1:1 reactant ratio is `Y + YFₙ -> 2YFₙ/₂`. This requires n to be an even number.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the clues to find the most consistent path.**\nLet's evaluate the strongest remaining candidates (Kr, Au, Am, Pt).\n\n*   **Americium (Am) Path:** Fits mass % and \"five compounds\" perfectly. The reaction `Am + AmF₄ -> 2AmF₂` fits the 1:1 ratio. This would make A4 = AmF₄. However, the molecular weight of AmF₄ is ~319 g/mol, which does not match any of the options.\n*   **Krypton (Kr) Path:** The reaction `Kr + KrF₄ -> 2KrF₂` fits the 1:1 ratio. This makes A4 = KrF₄. The molecular weight of KrF₄ is ~159.8 g/mol, which fits option C (140-160). However, this path strongly contradicts the \"five compounds\" clue.\n*   **Gold (Au) Path:** The \"five compounds\" clue is plausible. The mass % for A2=AuF₅ (32.54%) is a reasonable fit. The reaction `Au + AuF₂ -> 2AuF` fits the 1:1 reactant ratio. This would make **A4 = AuF₂**. Let's check the molecular weight of AuF₂.\n    *   M(Au) ≈ 197.0 g/mol\n    *   M(F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol\n    *   MW(AuF₂) = 197.0 + 2 * 19.0 = **235.0 g/mol**.\n    *   This molecular weight falls squarely in the range **A) 220-240**.\n\n**Step 4: Final check of the Gold (Au) hypothesis.**\n*   **Y = Au**.\n*   **Five compounds:** Plausible (AuF, AuF₂, AuF₃, AuF₅, AuF₇-complex).\n*   **A2 = AuF₅:** Fits mass % reasonably well.\n*   **A1:** A higher fluoride (e.g., AuF₇ complex) that decomposes to A2 (AuF₅) and F₂. Fits.\n*   **A1/A3 oxidize Xe:** Higher gold fluorides are exceptionally strong oxidizers. Fits.\n*   **A4 = AuF₂:** MW is ~235 g/mol, which fits option A.\n*   **Reaction:** `Au + A4(AuF₂) -> A5` in a 1:1 ratio. The product A5 would be AuF (from 2AuF). Fits.\n*   **A5 decomposes in water:** AuF is unstable in water. Fits.\n\nThis path provides a consistent solution for all clues, assuming A2 and A4 are different compounds (A2=AuF₅ from mass %, A4=AuF₂ from reaction stoichiometry and MW options). This is the most complete and logical solution among the possibilities.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which may be misleading or contain errors, a common feature in chemistry olympiad problems. A careful, step-by-step analysis is required to find the most consistent solution.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2**\n\nThe most reliable starting point is the quantitative data. Substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ. The molar mass of element Y (Mᵧ) can be related to the number of fluorine atoms (n) using the formula for mass percentage (M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol):\n\nMᵧ ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nTesting integer values for n gives us potential candidates for element Y:\n*   n=2: Mᵧ ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for KrF₂ is ~31.2%, which is a reasonable match.\n*   n=3: Mᵧ ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for SbF₃ is ~31.9%, an excellent match.\n*   n=6: Mᵧ ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to Americium (Am, 243 g/mol) or Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for AmF₆ is ~31.9%, also an excellent match.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Comproportionation Reaction**\n\nClue 7, \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained,\" is the most chemically specific and restrictive clue. It strongly implies a comproportionation reaction where the element in its elemental state reacts with a higher-valent fluoride in a 1:1 ratio. The general form of this reaction is:\nY(0) + Y(+n)Fₙ → 2Y(+n/2)Fₙ/₂\n\nLet's test our best candidates against this clue:\n*   **Antimony (Sb):** The known comproportionation reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. This is not a 1:1 ratio of reactants. This hypothesis fails.\n*   **Americium (Am):** The reaction Am + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂ fits the 1:1 ratio perfectly. This would identify A4 as AmF₄. However, the molecular weight of AmF₄ is ~319 g/mol, which does not fall into any of the provided answer ranges.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** The reaction Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂ also fits the 1:1 ratio perfectly. This identifies **A4 as KrF₄**.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Krypton Hypothesis and Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nLet's assume Y is Krypton and see if the other clues fit, accepting that some descriptive details might be flawed.\n*   **Y = Krypton (Kr)**\n*   **A4 = Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)**\n*   The reaction is Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂. This means **A5 is KrF₂**.\n*   Clue 2 says A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. If we assume A2 is the same as A5 (KrF₂), then A1 must be KrF₄. This is consistent.\n*   Clues 4 & 5 state that A1 (KrF₄) and A3 oxidize xenon. This is a known property of powerful fluorinating agents like krypton fluorides.\n*   Clue 8 states that A5 (KrF₂) decomposes in water. This is also correct.\n*   The clues that do not fit perfectly are the \"five binary compounds\" (Krypton only has two well-established ones) and the \"bright-red\" color of A1 (KrF₄ is a white solid). These are likely inaccuracies in the problem statement.\n\nThe most consistent logical path that incorporates the key chemical reaction and leads to a valid answer is the Krypton hypothesis. The question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4.\n\n*   **A4** is identified as **Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)**.\n*   Calculate its molecular weight:\n    M(KrF₄) = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\n    M(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 × 19.00 g/mol\n    M(KrF₄) ≈ 159.80 g/mol\n\n**Step 4: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 159.80 g/mol falls within the range of **140-160**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which are contradictory or inaccurate, which is common in advanced chemistry problems. The key is to find the most consistent logical path.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of A2**\n\n*   The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96%.\n*   The formula for the molar mass of element Y (M_Y) based on the formula YFₙ is M_Y ≈ 40.45 × n.\n*   Testing integer values for n:\n    *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol).\n    *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol).\n    *   n=6: M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is close to Americium (Am, 243 g/mol).\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Candidates based on Chemical Clues**\n\nWe must evaluate these candidates (Kr, Sb, Am) against the other clues. The most definitive clue is the reaction stoichiometry.\n\n*   **Clue:** \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n*   This describes a comproportionation reaction: Y(0) + A4(YFₙ) → A5. The 1:1 molar ratio of reactants is a very strict constraint.\n\nLet's test the candidates:\n*   **Antimony (Sb):** The known comproportionation is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. The reactant ratio is 2:3, not 1:1. This hypothesis fails.\n*   **Americium (Am):** The reaction Am + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂ has a 1:1 reactant ratio. This is a very strong fit. It would identify A4 as AmF₄. The molecular weight of AmF₄ is ~319 g/mol, which does not fit any of the provided options. This suggests the options are incorrect for this path, or this is not the intended element.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** The reaction Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂ is a known comproportionation. The molar ratio of the reactants, element Y (Kr) and compound A4 (KrF₄), is exactly 1:1. This is a perfect fit for the reaction clue.\n\n**Step 3: Final Identification based on the Krypton Hypothesis**\n\nThe Krypton hypothesis provides the only path that satisfies the unique 1:1 reaction stoichiometry and leads to a molecular weight within the given options. While there are inconsistencies (KrF₄ is not red, and Kr doesn't have five well-established binary fluorides), these are likely deliberate inaccuracies in the problem statement to make it more challenging. The reaction stoichiometry is a much stronger and less ambiguous clue.\n\n1.  **Element Y** is **Krypton (Kr)**.\n2.  **A2** is **KrF₂**. (Calculated ɷF is 31.2%, a reasonable match for 31.96%).\n3.  **A1** decomposes to A2+F₂, so **A1 is KrF₄**.\n4.  The reaction **Y + A4 → A5** is **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂**.\n5.  This uniquely identifies **A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\n*   Substance A4 is KrF₄.\n*   Molar Mass of Kr ≈ 83.80 g/mol.\n*   Molar Mass of F ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n*   Molecular Weight of KrF₄ = 83.80 + (4 × 19.00) = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.80 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Molecular Weight to the Given Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 159.80 g/mol falls within the range:\nA) 140-160\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which appear to be contradictory or contain errors, a common feature in advanced chemistry problems. The most robust method to solve this is to prioritize the quantitative clues (mass percentage, reaction stoichiometry) and use the qualitative clues to select the most plausible candidate.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of A2**\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ.\nThe molar mass of Y, M(Y), can be related to the number of fluorine atoms, n, by the formula:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nLet's test integer values for n:\n*   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (e.g., Ca, Ar) - Unlikely chemistry.\n*   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Br, Se, Kr) - Plausible.\n*   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol (e.g., Sb) - Plausible.\n*   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (e.g., Dy) - Unlikely chemistry.\n*   n = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol (e.g., Au, Pt, Bi) - Plausible.\n*   n = 6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (e.g., Pu, Am) - Plausible.\n\nThe strongest candidates based on their known fluoride chemistry (forming multiple binary compounds, high reactivity) are Krypton (Kr), Antimony (Sb), Gold (Au), Platinum (Pt), and the actinides like Americium (Am).\n\n**Step 2: Use the Reaction Stoichiometry to Identify A4**\n\nThe most specific and unusual clue is the reaction: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThis describes a reaction: **Y + A4 → A5** where the reactants are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\nThis is a perfect description of a comproportionation reaction where an element in its elemental state (Y) reacts with a higher-valent compound of the same element (A4) to form a compound of intermediate valence (A5). The most common form of this reaction is:\n**Y + YF₂ₙ → 2YFₙ**\n\nThis reaction has a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants (Y and YF₂ₙ). This provides a direct link between the compounds.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis**\n\nLet's test this hypothesis, as it provides the most self-consistent solution that matches the given options.\n1.  **Identify Y and A2:** If Y = Krypton (Kr, M ≈ 83.8 g/mol), then for n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is a reasonable fit. So, let's assume **A2 = KrF₂**. The theoretical ɷF in KrF₂ is ~31.2%, which is acceptably close to the given 31.96%.\n2.  **Identify A1:** A1 decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and F₂. This means **A1 = KrF₄**. The fact that A1 is unstable at room temperature (293 K) and oxidizes xenon fits the known properties of KrF₄. The \"bright-red\" color is likely an error in the problem statement, as KrF₄ is a white solid.\n3.  **Apply the Comproportionation Reaction:** The reaction is Y + A4 → A5. Using our model `Y + YF₂ₙ → 2YFₙ`, and knowing the krypton fluorides are KrF₂ and KrF₄, the only possible reaction is:\n    **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂**\n4.  **Identify A4 and A5:** Comparing this to `Y + A4 → A5`, we can identify:\n    *   **Y = Kr**\n    *   **A4 = KrF₄**\n    *   **A5 = KrF₂** (The product is two molecules of KrF₂)\n5.  **Final Check of Clues:** This assignment is consistent. A2 and A5 are the same substance (KrF₂). A1 and A4 are the same substance (KrF₄). The clue about A5 decomposing in water is also true for KrF₂. The main inconsistencies are the \"five compounds\" and \"bright-red\" color, which must be assumed to be errors.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nWe have identified A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n*   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF₄) = 83.80 + 4 × 19.00 = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.80 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 159.80 g/mol falls within the range of **140-160**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem is a chemical puzzle that requires careful deduction, prioritizing the most reliable clues while acknowledging potential inaccuracies in the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Quantitative Clue to Identify Element Y**\n\nThe most reliable piece of information is the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in compound A2, given as 31.96%.\nLet the formula of A2 be YFₙ. The molar mass of Y, M(Y), can be related to the number of fluorine atoms, n, using the formula for mass percentage (M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol):\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nTesting integer values for n:\n*   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (e.g., Ca, Ar)\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Br, Se, Kr)\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (e.g., Sb)\n\nThe problem describes compounds that can oxidize xenon (A1, A3), which is a hallmark of extremely powerful oxidizing agents, most famously the fluorides of noble gases like Krypton. Let's test the Krypton (Kr, M ≈ 83.8 g/mol) hypothesis.\nIf Y = Kr and n=2, then A2 = KrF₂.\nThe theoretical ɷF in KrF₂ is (2 × 19.00) / (83.8 + 38.0) ≈ 31.2%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96% and is the most plausible fit given the chemical context.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Compounds using the Reaction Clues**\n\nWith Y = Krypton (Kr) and A2 = KrF₂, we can decipher the other compounds:\n*   **A1:** The decomposition `A1 → A2 + F₂` becomes `A1 → KrF₂ + F₂`. This implies **A1 = KrF₄**. The description of A1 as \"bright-red\" is likely an inaccuracy, as KrF₄ is a white solid, but its extreme reactivity and instability fit the other clues.\n*   **A4 and A5:** This is the key step. The reaction is `Y + A4 → A5` with a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants. Substituting our identified element Y:\n    `Kr + A4 → A5`\n    This strongly suggests a comproportionation reaction, where an element in different oxidation states reacts to form a product in an intermediate state. The most elegant interpretation is:\n    `Kr(0) + KrF₄(+4) → 2KrF₂(+2)`\n    This reaction perfectly matches the 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants (Y and A4).\n    This identifies **A4 as KrF₄** and A5 as KrF₂.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Determine the Range**\n\nWe have identified substance A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n*   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n\nMolecular Weight of A4 (KrF₄) = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\nMW(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 + 4 × 19.00\nMW(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 + 76.00\nMW(KrF₄) ≈ 159.80 g/mol\n\n**Step 4: Match the Result to the Given Options**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.80 g/mol. We compare this to the given ranges:\nA) 110-130\nB) 140-160\nC) 220-240\nD) 160-180\n\nThe value 159.80 g/mol falls squarely within the range **140-160**.\n\nThis line of reasoning, primarily followed by candidate answers 1 and 5, provides the most coherent and chemically sound solution, successfully integrating all the major clues despite minor descriptive inaccuracies in the problem statement.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which are contradictory, a common feature in advanced chemistry problems designed to test deductive reasoning. A step-by-step analysis is required to find the most plausible path to the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2**\n\nThe most crucial quantitative clue is that substance A2 contains 31.96% fluorine (F) by mass. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of F is ~19.0 g/mol.\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F)).\nRearranging to solve for the molar mass of Y gives: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n.\n\nWe can test integer values for 'n' to find candidate elements for Y:\n*   **n=2:** M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for KrF₂ is ~31.2%. This is a reasonable fit.\n*   **n=3:** M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is extremely close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for SbF₃ is ~31.9%. This is an excellent fit.\n*   **n=5:** M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol. This is close to Gold (Au, 197.0 g/mol) and Platinum (Pt, 195.1 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for AuF₅ is ~32.5%. This is also a reasonable fit.\n*   **n=6:** M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is extremely close to Americium (Am, 243 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for AmF₆ is ~31.93%. This is an excellent fit.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Candidates Against Other Clues**\n\nWe must use the other clues to eliminate candidates. The most discriminating clues are the existence of five binary fluorides, the \"bright-red\" color of A1, the ability to oxidize xenon, and the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry.\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb):** While the mass percentage is a great fit, this path fails on multiple counts. Antimony only forms two stable binary fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅), not five. SbF₅ (which would be A1) is a colorless liquid, not a bright-red solid. The 1:1 reaction stoichiometry is not observed in its comproportionation reactions.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** This path has a reasonable mass % fit and explains the decomposition of A1 (KrF₄ → KrF₂). However, it fails on key points: only two binary fluorides are well-known, not five, and KrF₄ is a white solid, not red.\n*   **Americium (Am):** This path is almost perfect. It fits the mass percentage, the existence of five fluorides, and all reaction chemistry. However, the calculated molecular weight for A4 (AmF₄, MW ≈ 319 g/mol) does not fall into any of the provided options, suggesting this is not the intended answer for this multiple-choice question.\n*   **Gold (Au):** This path is very strong.\n    *   **Five binary compounds:** Gold is known to form several fluorides (AuF, AuF₃, AuF₅) and related species, making \"five\" plausible in a puzzle context.\n    *   **Color and Oxidation:** A1 is \"bright-red\" and oxidizes xenon. Gold(V) fluoride (AuF₅) is a red solid and an extremely powerful oxidizing agent. This fits well. If A2 is AuF₅, then A1 is a higher, unstable fluoride that decomposes to it.\n    *   **Mass Percentage:** The mass % of F in AuF₅ (~32.5%) is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **1:1 Reaction:** The clue is `Y + A4 -> A5` in a 1:1 molar ratio. This can be interpreted as a comproportionation reaction. Let's test the gold fluorides as A4 to see if any fit the options. The known fluorides are AuF, AuF₃, and AuF₅. A hypothetical AuF₂ is also sometimes discussed.\n        *   MW(AuF) ≈ 216 g/mol\n        *   **MW(AuF₂) ≈ 235 g/mol**\n        *   MW(AuF₃) ≈ 254 g/mol\n        *   MW(AuF₅) ≈ 292 g/mol\n    *   The molecular weight of AuF₂ (~235 g/mol) falls squarely in the range **D) 220-240**.\n    *   If we assume **A4 is AuF₂**, the reaction `Au + AuF₂ → 2AuF` has a 1:1 reactant ratio and produces A5 = AuF. This is a chemically sound comproportionation. The final clue, that A5 (AuF) decomposes in water, is also correct.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe hypothesis that Y is Gold (Au) provides the most consistent solution that aligns with the chemical properties described and leads to one of the provided numerical answers.\n\n*   **Element Y:** Gold (Au)\n*   **A1:** A higher, unstable fluoride of gold (e.g., AuF₇ complex).\n*   **A2:** AuF₅ (fits mass % and is the decomposition product of A1).\n*   **A3:** AuF₅ (powerful oxidant formed from fluorinating gold).\n*   **A4:** AuF₂ (based on its molecular weight fitting an option and its role in a plausible 1:1 reaction).\n*   **A5:** AuF (product of the 1:1 reaction, decomposes in water).\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (AuF₂) is calculated as:\nMW(AuF₂) = MW(Au) + 2 × MW(F) ≈ 197.0 + 2 × 19.0 = **235.0 g/mol**.\n\nThis value falls within the range of 220-240 g/mol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which appear contradictory. A careful, step-by-step analysis is required to find the most logical solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of A2**\n\nThe most crucial quantitative clue is that substance A2 contains 31.96% fluorine (F) by mass. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine is ~19.00 g/mol.\n\nThe formula for the mass percentage of fluorine is:\nɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\nRearranging to solve for the molar mass of Y, M(Y), gives the relationship:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe can test integer values for 'n' to find plausible elements:\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8) or Bromine (Br, 79.9).\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Antimony (Sb, 121.8).\n*   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol. This is reasonably close to Platinum (Pt, 195.1) or Gold (Au, 197.0).\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Americium (Am, 243) or Plutonium (Pu, 244).\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Candidates using Other Clues**\n\nWe must use the other clues to narrow down the possibilities. The clues about \"five binary compounds\" and the ability to \"oxidize xenon\" are particularly restrictive.\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb) and Krypton (Kr)** are poor candidates because they are not known to form five distinct binary fluorides, which contradicts a key premise of the problem.\n*   **Americium (Am)** is an excellent candidate. It forms five binary fluorides (AmF₂ to AmF₆), its higher fluorides are powerful oxidizers, and its chemistry fits the unique 1:1 reaction clue perfectly. However, this path leads to a molecular weight for A4 (~319 g/mol) that does not match any of the options, suggesting a flaw in the problem's options.\n*   **Platinum (Pt) and Gold (Au)** remain strong candidates. Both form multiple binary fluorides (fulfilling the \"five compounds\" clue) and their higher fluorides (like PtF₆ and AuF₅) are famously powerful oxidizing agents capable of reacting with xenon.\n\n**Step 3: Follow the Gold (Au) Hypothesis**\n\nThe Gold hypothesis provides the most consistent explanation that leads to one of the provided answers.\n\n1.  **Element Y is Gold (Au).**\n2.  **Five binary compounds**: Gold's known or theoretical binary fluorides (AuF, AuF₂, AuF₃, AuF₅, AuF₇-complex) fit this clue.\n3.  **A2 (ɷF=31.96%)**: If A2 is AuF₅, its fluorine percentage is ~32.5%. This is a reasonable match for a puzzle of this type.\n4.  **A1**: A higher, unstable fluoride like the AuF₇ complex would decompose to A2 (AuF₅), be highly reactive (oxidize xenon), and could be colored. This fits the description.\n5.  **A3**: This would also be AuF₅, a powerful oxidizing agent formed from fluorinating gold.\n6.  **A4 and the 1:1 Reaction**: The reaction is Y + A4 → A5 in a 1:1 molar ratio. If we hypothesize that **A4 is AuF₂**, the reaction becomes **Au + AuF₂ → 2AuF**. This reaction has a 1:1 reactant ratio and produces A5 = AuF. Gold(I) fluoride (AuF) is known to be unstable and would decompose in water, fitting the final clue.\n7.  **Molecular Weight of A4**: The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4. We have identified A4 as Gold(II) fluoride, AuF₂.\n    *   Molar Mass of Au ≈ 197.0 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of F ≈ 19.0 g/mol\n    *   MW(AuF₂) = 197.0 + (2 × 19.0) = 197.0 + 38.0 = **235.0 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 4: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 (AuF₂) is 235.0 g/mol. This value falls squarely within the range:\n\nA) 220-240\n\nThis pathway provides a coherent explanation for all the clues in the problem while leading to one of the given options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which are intentionally misleading or contain factual inaccuracies, which is common in advanced chemistry olympiad questions. A careful, step-by-step analysis is required to find the most consistent solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element Y**\n\nThe most reliable piece of information is the quantitative data: substance A2 contains 31.96% fluorine by mass (ɷF). Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ.\n\n*   The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F)), where M(F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol.\n*   Rearranging to solve for the molar mass of element Y, M(Y), gives the relation: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n.\n*   We test small integer values for n:\n    *   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This atomic mass is very close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol). The chemistry of a noble gas fits the clue that its compounds can oxidize xenon. Let's check the theoretical mass percentage for KrF₂: ɷF = (2 * 19) / (83.8 + 38) ≈ 31.2%. This is a reasonable match to the given 31.96%.\n    *   If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol). The theoretical mass percentage for SbF₃ is ≈ 31.9%. While the number is a better fit, the chemistry is not. Antimony fluorides are not known to oxidize xenon under normal conditions, which contradicts a key clue.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible candidate for **element Y is Krypton (Kr)**, and **A2 is Krypton difluoride (KrF₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Other Substances based on Y = Kr**\n\n*   **A1**: This substance decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine (F₂). This implies the reaction is A1 → KrF₂ + F₂. By conservation of mass, **A1 must be Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)**. KrF₄ is known to be highly unstable and decomposes at room temperature (293 K), fitting the description. The \"bright-red\" color is a known inaccuracy in this problem statement; KrF₄ is a white solid.\n*   **A3**: This is another krypton fluoride that oxidizes xenon. This could be KrF₂ or KrF₄.\n*   **A4 and A5**: This is the crucial step. A5 is obtained by adding Y (Kr) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. This describes the reaction:\n    Kr + A4 → A5 (Reactant ratio is 1:1)\n\n    This is a classic comproportionation reaction, where an element in different oxidation states reacts to form a product in an intermediate state. The most logical reaction involving known krypton fluorides is:\n    Kr(0) + KrF₄(+4) → 2KrF₂(+2)\n\n    This reaction perfectly matches the 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants (one mole of Kr reacts with one mole of KrF₄). This allows us to definitively identify the substances:\n    *   **A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).**\n    *   **A5 is Krypton difluoride (KrF₂).**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nThe question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4. We have identified A4 as KrF₄.\n\n*   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol.\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF₄) = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\n*   MW(KrF₄) = 83.80 + 4 × 19.00 = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.80 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 4: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.80 g/mol. We compare this value to the given options:\n\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 140-160\nD) 110-130\n\nThe value 159.80 g/mol falls within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis is a complex chemistry puzzle with several clues, some of which are potentially misleading or contain errors, a common feature in chemistry olympiad-style problems. A careful step-by-step analysis is required, prioritizing the most reliable chemical and quantitative information.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2**\n\nThe most reliable piece of information is usually quantitative. We are given that substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (formula YFₙ) and has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n\n*   The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n*   Using M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol, we can solve for M(Y): M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n.\n\nLet's test integer values for n:\n*   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (e.g., Ca, Ar - chemistry doesn't fit).\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Br, Kr).\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol (e.g., Sb).\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (e.g., Am, Pu).\n\nThe best numerical matches are for Antimony (SbF₃, ɷF=31.88%) and Americium (AmF₆, ɷF=31.93%). However, we must consider all clues.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Stoichiometry**\n\nThe most unique and restrictive clue is the reaction: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\nThis describes a comproportionation reaction where the element in its elemental state (Y) reacts with a higher fluoride of the same element (A4) to produce a fluoride with an intermediate oxidation state (A5). The 1:1 molar ratio of reactants is a critical constraint.\n\nLet's test the most plausible candidate elements against this clue:\n*   **Antimony (Sb):** The known comproportionation is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. The reactant ratio is 2:3, not 1:1. This hypothesis fails.\n*   **Americium (Am):** The reaction `Am + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂` has a 1:1 reactant ratio. This is a strong fit. However, the molecular weight of A4 (AmF₄) would be ~319 g/mol, which is not among the options.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** The reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂` is a known comproportionation with a 1:1 reactant ratio. This is a perfect fit for the description.\n\n**Step 3: Build a Consistent Hypothesis around Krypton**\n\nThe perfect fit for the 1:1 reaction makes Krypton the most likely intended element, despite some inconsistencies in other clues.\n\n*   **Element Y = Krypton (Kr)**.\n*   **A2 = KrF₂**. The theoretical ɷF is ~31.2%, which is acceptably close to 31.96% for this type of problem.\n*   **A1 → A2 + F₂**: This implies the reaction is `KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂`. Thus, **A1 = KrF₄**. The description of A1 as \"bright-red\" and unstable at 293 K fits the high reactivity of KrF₄, even if the color is inaccurate (it's a white solid). Its ability to oxidize xenon is also correct.\n*   **Y + A4 → A5 (1:1 ratio)**: As established, this is the reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂`.\n*   From this reaction, we can identify the reactants and product:\n    *   Y = Kr\n    *   **A4 = KrF₄**\n    *   A5 = KrF₂\n*   **A5 decomposes in water**: KrF₂ does indeed decompose in water (`2KrF₂ + 2H₂O → 2Kr + O₂ + 4HF`), which fits the final clue.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nWe have confidently identified substance A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n\n*   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF₄) = 83.80 + (4 × 19.00) = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.80 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 159.80 g/mol falls within the range given in option A.\n\n*   **A) 140-160**\n*   B) 110-130\n*   C) 160-180\n*   D) 220-240\n\nThe Krypton hypothesis is the only one that provides a consistent explanation for the most complex and specific chemical reaction described in the problem, leading to a definitive answer among the options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which are contradictory or potentially erroneous. A careful step-by-step analysis is required to find the most plausible solution by prioritizing the most reliable information.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of A2**\n\nThe most reliable clue is the quantitative data: substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ.\n\n*   The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M_F) / (M_Y + n × M_F)\n*   Using M_F ≈ 19.0 g/mol, we can solve for the molar mass of Y (M_Y):\n    M_Y ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test integer values for 'n':\n*   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol).\n*   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol).\n*   n=6: M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to Americium (Am, 243 g/mol) or Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol).\n\nThe description of compounds that can oxidize xenon strongly suggests a noble gas or a very high-oxidation-state metal fluoride. Krypton is a strong candidate. Let's check the theoretical mass percentage for KrF₂:\nɷF(KrF₂) = (2 × 19.0) / (83.8 + 38.0) ≈ 31.2%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Stoichiometry**\n\nThe most unique and restrictive clue is the reaction: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\n*   This describes a reaction where the reactants are Y and A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   This strongly suggests a comproportionation reaction, where an element in its zero oxidation state reacts with a compound of the same element in a higher oxidation state.\n*   If we assume Y is Krypton (Kr), the reaction is: Kr + A4 → A5.\n*   For this to be a comproportionation, A4 must be a higher fluoride of krypton. The only other known binary fluoride is KrF₄.\n*   Let's test the reaction: **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂**\n*   This reaction has a **perfect 1:1 molar ratio** of the reactants (Kr and KrF₄). This is a very strong confirmation of this chemical pathway.\n\n**Step 3: Identify all Substances and Verify Clues**\n\nBased on the Krypton hypothesis, which uniquely satisfies the 1:1 reaction clue:\n*   **Element Y:** Krypton (Kr).\n*   **A2:** KrF₂ (from the mass percentage and the reaction product).\n*   **A1:** The problem states A1 decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine. This identifies **A1 as KrF₄**.\n*   **A4:** The reaction is Kr + A4 → A5. We identified this as Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂. Therefore, **A4 is KrF₄**.\n*   **A5:** The product of the reaction is KrF₂. So, **A5 is KrF₂**.\n\nLet's check the remaining clues with this assignment:\n*   \"Five binary compounds\": This is a known inaccuracy in this famous problem. Krypton only forms two well-established binary fluorides. We must assume this clue is an error.\n*   \"A1 is bright-red\": KrF₄ is a white solid. This is also likely an error in the problem statement.\n*   \"A1 and A3 oxidize xenon\": KrF₄ and KrF₂ are extremely powerful oxidizing agents and would react with xenon. This is consistent.\n*   \"A4 is in a hot colorless concentrated solution\": KrF₄ is a colorless solid, and its solution in a suitable inert solvent (like anhydrous HF) would be colorless. This is plausible.\n*   \"A5 decomposes in water\": A5 is KrF₂. It reacts with water (2KrF₂ + 2H₂O → 2Kr + O₂ + 4HF). This fits the description.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nThe question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4. We have confidently identified A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n\n*   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF₄) = 83.80 + 4 × 19.00 = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.80 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Molecular Weight to the Given Ranges**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 159.80 g/mol falls within the range:\nA) 140-160\n\nThis solution is the most coherent, as it correctly interprets the most specific and unusual chemical clue (the 1:1 comproportionation reaction), while only needing to dismiss the less reliable qualitative descriptors which are likely errors in the problem statement.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which are potentially misleading. A careful, step-by-step analysis is required to find the most consistent solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the unknown element Y.**\nThe most crucial quantitative clue is that substance A2 contains 31.96% fluorine by mass (ɷF). We can establish a relationship between the molar mass of element Y (M(Y)) and the number of fluorine atoms (n) in the compound A2 (formula YFₙ).\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F)).\nUsing M(F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol and ɷF = 0.3196, we can solve for M(Y):\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test integer values for n:\n*   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (e.g., Ca, Ar). The chemistry described (oxidizing xenon) does not fit.\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol). Noble gases are known to form highly oxidizing fluorides. This is a strong candidate.\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol). While the mass percentage for SbF₃ is a near-perfect match (31.88%), its chemistry does not fully align with all the clues.\n*   n=4 or higher: Leads to other elements, but the Krypton hypothesis proves to be the most consistent.\n\nLet's proceed with **Y = Krypton (Kr)**.\n*   If Y=Kr, then A2 must be KrF₂. The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in KrF₂ is (2 * 19.0) / (83.8 + 38.0) ≈ 31.2%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the other compounds based on Y=Kr.**\n*   **A2 = KrF₂** (Krypton difluoride).\n*   **A1**: A bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (room temperature) into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine. The reaction is A1 → KrF₂ + F₂. This identifies **A1 as KrF₄** (Krypton tetrafluoride). KrF₄ is known to be highly unstable and decomposes at room temperature. It is also a powerful oxidizing agent capable of reacting with xenon. The \"bright-red\" color is a known inaccuracy or red herring in this classic problem; KrF₄ is a white solid.\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorinating Kr and also oxidizes xenon. This could be KrF₂ or KrF₄.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the key reaction to identify A4.**\nThis is the most decisive clue: \"By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\nThis describes a comproportionation reaction where Krypton in its elemental state (Kr, oxidation state 0) reacts with a Krypton compound of a higher oxidation state (A4) to form a product of an intermediate state (A5).\n\nThe reaction is: **Kr + A4 → A5** (with a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants).\n\nThe only known reaction that perfectly fits this description is:\n**Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂**\n\nLet's map this to the problem's variables:\n*   Y = Kr\n*   A4 = KrF₄\n*   A5 = KrF₂\n\nThis interpretation is chemically sound and elegantly satisfies the 1:1 ratio constraint.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of A4 and find the correct range.**\nBased on the analysis, substance A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n\n*   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF₄) = 83.80 + (4 × 19.00) = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.80 g/mol**.\n\nNow, we compare this value to the given ranges:\nA) 220-240\nB) 160-180\nC) 110-130\nD) 140-160\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 159.80 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
