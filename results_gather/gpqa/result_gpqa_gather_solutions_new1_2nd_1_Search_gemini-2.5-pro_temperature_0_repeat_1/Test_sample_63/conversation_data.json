  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\nA) 13\nB) 19\nC) 15\nD) 17\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nBased on the provided analyses, a clear and consistent solution emerges, despite some discrepancies in the final letter choices of the candidate answers.\n\n**Summary of Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Product Identification and Quantification:** All detailed analyses correctly identified the products and their molar amounts from the experimental data.\n    *   Mass increase in Tube №1 (H₂O absorber) = 3.60 g → **0.20 mol H₂O**.\n    *   Mass increase in Tube №3 (O₂ absorber) = 0.80 g → **0.025 mol O₂**.\n    *   Remaining gas C (2.24 L at STP) → **0.10 mol N₂**.\n    *   The lack of mass change in Tube №2 confirms no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced.\n\n2.  **Hypothesis Formulation:** The products (N₂, O₂, H₂O) strongly suggest the decomposition of two ammonium salts containing nitrogen and oxygen. The consensus hypothesis across all analyses is that the salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n3.  **Constraint Application and Verification:** This hypothesis was tested against the problem's constraints.\n    *   **Decomposition Reactions:**\n        *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n    *   **Stoichiometry:** Assuming an equimolar mixture of `n` moles of each salt, the total products would be `2n` moles of N₂, `n/2` moles of O₂, and `4n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   **Solving for `n`:** Using the experimental data, `n/2 = 0.025` mol O₂, which gives `n = 0.05` mol. This value is consistent with the amounts of N₂ (`2n = 0.10` mol) and H₂O (`4n = 0.20` mol).\n    *   **Mass Verification:** The total mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ (64.04 g/mol) and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ (80.04 g/mol) is (0.05 * 64.04) + (0.05 * 80.04) = 3.202 + 4.002 = 7.204 g, which matches the initial 7.20 g.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** The question asks for the total number of atoms in the formula units of salts A and B.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemical reasoning across all detailed candidate answers is sound and consistently leads to the conclusion that the total number of atoms is 17. The discrepancies in the final letter choices appear to be transcription errors. The correct numerical answer is 17, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Molar Quantities**\n\nThe problem provides data from a series of analytical tests on the gaseous products of a decomposition reaction.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since the weight did not change, no acidic gases were produced. This indicates the absence of elements like carbon in the original salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar Mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After the other gases were removed, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n*   **Identify Gas C:** We can use the law of conservation of mass. The initial mass (7.20 g) must equal the total mass of the products.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂)\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Deduce the Identity of Salts A and B**\n\nThe decomposition products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This means the original salts must contain the elements Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N). Since they are salts, a logical hypothesis is that they are ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. The two most common candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis by examining their decomposition reactions:\n*   **Reaction 1:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Reaction 2:** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThis set of reactions produces all the observed products.\n\n**3. Verify the Hypothesis with Stoichiometry**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume it contains `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O are produced.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio, which is 1:1:0.5:2 per mole): `n` moles of N₂, `0.5n` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O are produced.\n\nNow, let's sum the total moles of each product:\n*   **Total N₂ produced:** `n` (from NH₄NO₂) + `n` (from NH₄NO₃) = `2n`\n*   **Total H₂O produced:** `2n` (from NH₄NO₂) + `2n` (from NH₄NO₃) = `4n`\n*   **Total O₂ produced:** `0.5n` (from NH₄NO₃)\n\nWe can solve for `n` using our experimental results:\n*   From O₂: `0.5n` = 0.025 mol  => `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   From N₂: `2n` = 0.10 mol  => `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   From H₂O: `4n` = 0.20 mol => `n` = 0.05 mol.\n\nThe value `n = 0.05` is consistent across all products, confirming the identity of the salts and their molar amounts.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes the decomposition of a salt mixture into gases, which are then analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since the weight did not change, no acidic gases were produced. This rules out salts containing carbonate or other anions that would produce acidic gases upon decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining Gas):** After the other components were removed, 2.24 liters of gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n*   **Identify Gas C:** We can verify the identity of Gas C by checking the law of conservation of mass. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n    *   Mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A gas that is inert in this context and has a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Deduce the Identity of Salts A and B**\n\nThe decomposition products are N₂, H₂O, and O₂. This means the original salts must contain the elements Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. A logical hypothesis is that they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. The two most common candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. The problem states the mixture is equimolar, so let's assume it contains 'n' moles of each salt. We need to consider the decomposition reactions that would produce the observed gases:\n\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n    *(Note: This specific decomposition of ammonium nitrate is required to produce the observed O₂ gas.)*\n\nNow, let's calculate the total moles of each product from 'n' moles of each salt:\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂: produces `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃: produces `n` moles of N₂, `0.5n` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal moles of products:\n*   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n*   Total O₂ = 0.5n\n\nWe can now solve for 'n' using our experimental values:\n*   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Let's verify this 'n' value with the other products:\n    *   Total N₂ = 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (This matches our calculation.)\n    *   Total H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (This also matches.)\n\nThe consistent value of n = 0.05 mol confirms that the salts are indeed ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total Atoms:**\n    *   Total = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**\n\nThe total number of atoms is 17.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

Deduce the Identity of Salts A and B**\n\nThe products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This indicates the original salts contained Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen. Since they are salts, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. The most common candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. The decomposition reactions that yield the observed products are:\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate):** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume there are 'n' moles of each salt.\n\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: `n` moles of N₂, `0.5n` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O. (Note: the reaction is scaled to 1 mole of NH₄NO₃ for easier calculation).\n\n**Total moles of products:**\n*   Total N₂ = `n` + `n` = `2n`\n*   Total H₂O = `2n` + `2n` = `4n`\n*   Total O₂ = `0.5n`\n\nNow, we use the experimental quantities to solve for 'n':\n*   From O₂: `0.5n` = 0.025 mol → **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Let's verify this with the other products:\n    *   Total N₂ = `2n` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (This matches the experiment).\n    *   Total H₂O = `4n` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (This also matches the experiment).\n\nThe hypothesis is correct.

We need to find the decomposition reactions that produce the observed gases.\n\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** The decomposition of NH₄NO₃ is temperature-dependent. While at lower temperatures it produces N₂O, the presence of O₂ and N₂ as products points to a different reaction pathway: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g).\n\n**Step 3: Verify the stoichiometry.**\n\nLet's calculate the total moles of each product from a mixture of 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂ and 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂: produces `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio, which is 1:1:0.5:2 per mole): produces `n` moles of N₂, `0.5n` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal moles of products:\n*   Total N₂ = `n` + `n` = `2n`\n*   Total H₂O = `2n` + `2n` = `4n`\n*   Total O₂ = `0.5n`\n\nNow, we use our experimental values to solve for 'n':\n*   From O₂: `0.5n` = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Check with N₂: `2n` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol.

Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe products are N₂, H₂O, and O₂. This indicates the original salts contained the elements Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. Since the initial substances are salts, a logical hypothesis is that they are ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. The two most common candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis by examining their decomposition reactions:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n**3. Stoichiometric Verification**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume the mixture contains 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂ and 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n*   **Total O₂ produced:** Only NH₄NO₃ produces oxygen. According to the balanced equation, 2 moles of NH₄NO₃ produce 1 mole of O₂. Therefore, 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃ produce (n/2) moles of O₂.\n    *   n/2 = 0.025 mol  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Verify with other products:** Now we check if n = 0.05 mol is consistent with the amounts of N₂ and H₂O produced.\n    *   **Total N₂:** n (from NH₄NO₂) + n (from NH₄NO₃) = 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. This matches the experimental result.\n    *   **Total H₂O:** 2n (from NH₄NO₂) + 2n (from NH₄NO₃) = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. This also matches the experimental result.\n\nThe calculations are consistent, confirming the salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculation of Total Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\n*   Total Atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem provides data from passing the gaseous decomposition products through a series of analytical tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since the weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the absence of elements like carbon in the original salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Verify Mass Conservation and Identify Gas C**\n\nThe total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Now, we can calculate the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A common gas that is inert in this context and has a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition produced 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n**3. Deduce the Identity of Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) show that the original salts must contain Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen. Since they are salts, a logical assumption is that they are ammonium salts (containing the NH₄⁺ cation) of nitrogen-based oxyanions. The two most common candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. We need to find decomposition reactions that produce the observed products.\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** While it often decomposes to N₂O and H₂O, the presence of O₂ and N₂ as products points to the alternative decomposition: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n**4. Verify the Stoichiometry**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume it contains `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂: Produces `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio, which is 1:1:0.5:2 per mole of salt): Produces `n` moles of N₂, `0.5n` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal moles of products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = `n` + `n` = `2n`\n*   Total O₂ = `0.5n`\n*   Total H₂O = `2n` + `2n` = `4n`\n\nNow, we match this with our experimental results:\n*   From O₂: `0.5n` = 0.025 mol  => `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   Let's check if `n = 0.05` works for the other products:\n    *   Total N₂ = `2n` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (This matches our result).\n    *   Total H₂O = `4n` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (This also matches).\n\nThe hypothesis is correct. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrite and 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrate.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate solutions.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Problem and Gaseous Products**\n\nThe core of the problem is to identify two salts, A and B, by analyzing their thermal decomposition products. The analysis proceeds as follows:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (H₂O absorption):** A mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to 3.60 g of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Tube №2 (Acidic gas absorption):** No mass change indicates no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced.\n*   **Tube №3 (O₂ absorption):** A mass increase of 0.80 g corresponds to 0.80 g of O₂.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas):** 2.24 L at STP corresponds to:\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n*   **Identity of Gas C:** By conservation of mass, the mass of Gas C is the initial mass minus the mass of the other products: 7.20 g - 3.60 g (H₂O) - 0.80 g (O₂) = 2.80 g. The molar mass of Gas C is therefore 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol. This confirms Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n\nThis initial analysis is performed correctly and consistently across almost all candidate answers (e.g., Answers 2, 3, 5, 10, 11, 12, 15).\n\n**2. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (N₂, H₂O, O₂) indicate the original salts contain Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. The most plausible candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. The candidates are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nThe decomposition reactions that fit the products are:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n**3. Stoichiometric Verification**\n\nLet's assume the equimolar mixture contains `n` moles of each salt.\n*   Total O₂ produced = `0.5n` (only from NH₄NO₃). From the data, `0.5n` = 0.025 mol, which means **`n` = 0.05 mol**.\n*   Let's check this with the other products:\n    *   Total N₂ produced = `n` (from NH₄NO₂) + `n` (from NH₄NO₃) = `2n` = 2 * 0.05 = **0.10 mol**. This matches the data.\n    *   Total H₂O produced = `2n` (from NH₄NO₂) + `2n` (from NH₄NO₃) = `4n` = 4 * 0.05 = **0.20 mol**. This also matches the data.\n\nThe identification of the salts as 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ is correct and confirmed by the stoichiometry. This reasoning is also consistent across nearly all candidate answers.\n\n**4. Final Calculation of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which implies the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total Atoms = 8 + 9 = 17**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe detailed chemical analysis, performed consistently by the vast majority of the agents, robustly leads to the conclusion that the total number of atoms is 17.\n\nWhile many agents selected an incorrect final letter (A, B, or D), their detailed reasoning overwhelmingly supports the answer 17. Agent 5 is the only one that is correct in both its reasoning and its final selection. The most logical conclusion is to trust the consensus of the detailed analysis rather than the erroneous final selections.\n\nThe correct number of atoms is 17, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify Products\n\nThe problem describes the decomposition of a salt mixture into gases, which are then identified by passing them through a series of analytical tubes.\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent. Its mass increased by 3.60 g, which is the mass of the water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   **Moles of H₂O** = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. The weight did not change, indicating **no acidic gases were produced**. This rules out salts containing carbonate, sulfite, etc.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar Mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   **Moles of O₂** = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n4.  **Gas C:** The remaining gas has a volume of 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   **Moles of Gas C** = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   To identify Gas C, we can use the law of conservation of mass. The initial mass (7.20 g) must equal the total mass of the products.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is **nitrogen (N₂)**.\n\nIn summary, the decomposition produced **0.20 mol H₂O**, **0.025 mol O₂**, and **0.10 mol N₂**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Salts A and B\n\nThe products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) show that the original salts must contain the elements H, O, and N. A common class of salts that decompose into these gases are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. Let's test the hypothesis that the salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\nThe relevant decomposition reactions are:\n*   **NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O**\n*   **2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O** (This pathway produces O₂, matching the experimental result).\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Hypothesis with Stoichiometry\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume it contains 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂ and 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n*   **Total O₂ produced:** Only NH₄NO₃ produces O₂. From the reaction `2NH₄NO₃ → O₂`, the molar ratio is 2:1. So, `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ produce `n/2` moles of O₂.\n    *   `n/2` = 0.025 mol  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**.\n*   This means the mixture contained **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃** and **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂**.\n\nLet's check if this is consistent with the other products:\n*   **Total N₂ produced:**\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: 0.05 mol N₂\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (ratio 2:2 or 1:1): 0.05 mol N₂\n    *   Total N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = **0.10 mol**. (Matches experiment)\n*   **Total H₂O produced:**\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ (ratio 1:2): 0.10 mol H₂O\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (ratio 2:4 or 1:2): 0.10 mol H₂O\n    *   Total H₂O = 0.10 + 0.10 = **0.20 mol**. (Matches experiment)\n\nThe hypothesis is fully consistent with the product quantities.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**\n\n**Total Atoms = 8 + 9 = 17**\n\nThis corresponds to option D. A review of the candidate answers shows that while many perform the correct chemical analysis to arrive at 17, they often select the wrong letter. The correct calculation leads to 17.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Identification and Quantification of Gaseous Products**\n\nThe first step is to use the experimental data to identify the gases produced during the decomposition and calculate their molar quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** The weight did not change, indicating that no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced. This rules out salts containing carbonate or other anions that would produce acidic gases upon decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** This tube reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining Gas):** The remaining volume is 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n*   **Identity of Gas C:** We can determine the identity of Gas C by using the law of conservation of mass. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂)\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Summary of Products:** The decomposition yielded 0.20 mol of H₂O, 0.025 mol of O₂, and 0.10 mol of N₂.\n\n### **2. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (N₂, H₂O, O₂) indicate the original salts must contain Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. Since they are salts, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. The most common candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nWe must check if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these two salts matches the product quantities.\n\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate:** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n    *   *Careful Point:* While ammonium nitrate typically decomposes to N₂O and H₂O at 200°C, the problem's evidence (production of O₂) forces the conclusion that this specific decomposition pathway occurred.\n\nLet's assume the equimolar mixture contains `n` moles of each salt.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O are produced.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃: `n` moles of N₂, `0.5n` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O are produced (based on the 1:1:0.5:2 molar ratio per mole of NH₄NO₃).\n\n**Total moles of products in terms of `n`:**\n*   Total N₂ = `n` + `n` = `2n`\n*   Total H₂O = `2n` + `2n` = `4n`\n*   Total O₂ = `0.5n`\n\nNow, we solve for `n` using the experimental values:\n*   From O₂: `0.5n` = 0.025 mol  => **`n` = 0.05 mol**\n*   Checking with N₂: `2n` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (This matches the experimental value).\n*   Checking with H₂O: `4n` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (This also matches).\n\nThe value `n` = 0.05 mol is consistent, confirming the salts are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃.\n\n### **3. Final Calculation: Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total Atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1.

Determine the Identity of Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nThe total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g) due to the law of conservation of mass.\n*   Mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n*   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n*   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n\nNow, we can calculate the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that is inert in this context is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition products are 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n**3. Deduce the Identities of Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) indicate the original salts contain the elements Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen.

Identify Salts A and B from the Products**\n\nThe decomposition produced 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂. The original salts must therefore contain the elements H, O, and N. Given they are salts, they are likely ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. The most plausible candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's examine their decomposition reactions that fit the products:\n*   **Reaction for Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Reaction for Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n**3.

Identify Gaseous Products and Calculate Moles**\n\nThe problem provides data from passing the gaseous decomposition products through a series of analytical tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O absorbed = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tests for acidic gases (like CO₂).\n    *   The weight did not change, meaning **no acidic gases were produced**.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase is the mass of the oxygen gas.\n    *   Mass of O₂ reacted = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** This is the gas left after H₂O and O₂ are removed.\n    *   Volume = 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Verify Mass Conservation and Identify Gas C**\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that the initial mass of the salts must equal the total mass of the products.\n*   Initial mass = 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n*   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C: Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition products are: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n**3. Deduce the Identity of Salts A and B**\n\nThe products contain the elements H, O, and N. The salts must be composed of these elements. A common cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺), and the anions are likely nitrogen-oxygen compounds. The two most plausible salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's check their decomposition reactions:\n*   **NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O**\n*   **2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O** (This reaction produces O₂, matching the experimental findings).\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume it contains `n` moles of each salt.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂: produces `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃: produces `n` moles of N₂, `0.5n` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal moles of products in terms of `n`:\n*   Total N₂ = `n` + `n` = `2n`\n*   Total O₂ = `0.5n`\n*   Total H₂O = `2n` + `2n` = `4n`\n\nNow, we use our calculated moles to solve for `n`:\n*   From O₂: `0.5n` = 0.025 mol  =>  **`n` = 0.05 mol**.\n\nLet's verify this value of `n` with the other products:\n*   Check N₂: `2n` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (This matches the experimental value).\n*   Check H₂O: `4n` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (This also matches).\n\nThe hypothesis is correct. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrite and 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrate.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most perform the correct chemical analysis leading to the number 17, they often conclude with the wrong letter.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the correct solution path.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Molar Quantities**\n\nThe problem provides data from a series of analytical tests on the gaseous decomposition products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution detects acidic gases like CO₂. The weight did not change, which is a crucial piece of negative evidence: no acidic gases were formed. This rules out salts containing anions like carbonate or sulfite.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen gas that reacted.\n    *   Molar Mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining Gas):** After the other components were removed, 2.24 L of gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Molar Volume at STP = 22.4 L/mol\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**\n    *   To confirm the identity of Gas C, we can use the law of conservation of mass. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n        *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g (total) - 3.60 g (H₂O) - 0.80 g (O₂) = 2.80 g\n        *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that is inert in this context is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Deduce the Identity of Salts A and B**\n\nThe products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. The original salts must therefore contain Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen. Since they are salts, a logical hypothesis is that they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. The two most common candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. The mixture is equimolar, so let's assume it contains `n` moles of each salt.\n\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ produce `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate:** The reaction that produces O₂ is 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g).\n    *   This means 1 mole of NH₄NO₃ produces 1 mole of N₂, 0.5 moles of O₂, and 2 moles of H₂O.\n    *   `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ produce `n` moles of N₂, `0.5n` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\n**3. Verify the Hypothesis with Stoichiometry**\n\nLet's sum the total moles of each product from the decomposition of `n` moles of each salt:\n*   Total Moles O₂ = `0.5n` (only from NH₄NO₃)\n*   Total Moles N₂ = `n` (from NH₄NO₂) + `n` (from NH₄NO₃) = `2n`\n*   Total Moles H₂O = `2n` (from NH₄NO₂) + `2n` (from NH₄NO₃) = `4n`\n\nNow, we use our experimental values to solve for `n`:\n*   From O₂: `0.5n` = 0.025 mol  => **`n` = 0.05 mol**\n\nLet's check if this value of `n` is consistent with the other products:\n*   Check N₂: `2n` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. This matches the experimental value.\n*   Check H₂O: `4n` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. This also matches the experimental value.\n\nThe hypothesis is confirmed. The mixture consists of 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrite and 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrate.\n\n**4.

It confirms that no acidic gases were produced, ruling out salts containing anions like carbonate (CO₃²⁻) or sulfite (SO₃²⁻).\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with and removes oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar Mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining Gas):** After the other components were removed, 2.24 liters of gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n*   **Identify Gas C:** We can use the law of conservation of mass to confirm the identity of Gas C.

This value is consistent with the amounts of N₂ (`2n = 0.10` mol) and H₂O (`4n = 0.20` mol).\n    *   **Mass Verification:** The total mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ (64.04 g/mol) and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ (80.04 g/mol) is (0.05 * 64.04) + (0.05 * 80.04) = 3.202 + 4.002 = 7.204 g, which matches the initial 7.20 g.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** The question asks for the total number of atoms in the formula units of salts A and B.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemical reasoning across all detailed candidate answers is sound and consistently leads to the conclusion that the total number of atoms is 17. The discrepancies in the final letter choices appear to be transcription errors. The correct numerical answer is 17, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

Calculation of Total Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\n*   Total Atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem provides data from passing the gaseous decomposition products through a series of analytical tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since the weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the absence of elements like carbon in the original salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Verify Mass Conservation and Identify Gas C**\n\nThe total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Now, we can calculate the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A common gas that is inert in this context and has a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition produced 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n**3. Deduce the Identity of Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) show that the original salts must contain Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen. Since they are salts, a logical assumption is that they are ammonium salts (containing the NH₄⁺ cation) of nitrogen-based oxyanions. The two most common candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. We need to find decomposition reactions that produce the observed products.\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** While it often decomposes to N₂O and H₂O, the presence of O₂ and N₂ as products points to the alternative decomposition: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n**4. Verify the Stoichiometry**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume it contains `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂: Produces `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio, which is 1:1:0.5:2 per mole of salt): Produces `n` moles of N₂, `0.5n` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal moles of products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = `n` + `n` = `2n`\n*   Total O₂ = `0.5n`\n*   Total H₂O = `2n` + `2n` = `4n`\n\nNow, we match this with our experimental results:\n*   From O₂: `0.5n` = 0.025 mol  => `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   Let's check if `n = 0.05` works for the other products:\n    *   Total N₂ = `2n` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (This matches our result).\n    *   Total H₂O = `4n` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (This also matches).\n\nThe hypothesis is correct. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrite and 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrate.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate solutions.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Problem and Gaseous Products**\n\nThe core of the problem is to identify two salts, A and B, by analyzing their thermal decomposition products. The analysis proceeds as follows:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (H₂O absorption):** A mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to 3.60 g of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Tube №2 (Acidic gas absorption):** No mass change indicates no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced.\n*   **Tube №3 (O₂ absorption):** A mass increase of 0.80 g corresponds to 0.80 g of O₂.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas):** 2.24 L at STP corresponds to:\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n*   **Identity of Gas C:** By conservation of mass, the mass of Gas C is the initial mass minus the mass of the other products: 7.20 g - 3.60 g (H₂O) - 0.80 g (O₂) = 2.80 g. The molar mass of Gas C is therefore 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol. This confirms Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n\nThis initial analysis is performed correctly and consistently across almost all candidate answers (e.g., Answers 2, 3, 5, 10, 11, 12, 15).\n\n**2. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (N₂, H₂O, O₂) indicate the original salts contain Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. The most plausible candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. The candidates are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nThe decomposition reactions that fit the products are:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n**3. Stoichiometric Verification**\n\nLet's assume the equimolar mixture contains `n` moles of each salt.\n*   Total O₂ produced = `0.5n` (only from NH₄NO₃). From the data, `0.5n` = 0.025 mol, which means **`n` = 0.05 mol**.\n*   Let's check this with the other products:\n    *   Total N₂ produced = `n` (from NH₄NO₂) + `n` (from NH₄NO₃) = `2n` = 2 * 0.05 = **0.10 mol**. This matches the data.\n    *   Total H₂O produced = `2n` (from NH₄NO₂) + `2n` (from NH₄NO₃) = `4n` = 4 * 0.05 = **0.20 mol**. This also matches the data.\n\nThe identification of the salts as 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ is correct and confirmed by the stoichiometry. This reasoning is also consistent across nearly all candidate answers.\n\n**4. Final Calculation of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which implies the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total Atoms = 8 + 9 = 17**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe detailed chemical analysis, performed consistently by the vast majority of the agents, robustly leads to the conclusion that the total number of atoms is 17.\n\nWhile many agents selected an incorrect final letter (A, B, or D), their detailed reasoning overwhelmingly supports the answer 17. Agent 5 is the only one that is correct in both its reasoning and its final selection. The most logical conclusion is to trust the consensus of the detailed analysis rather than the erroneous final selections.\n\nThe correct number of atoms is 17, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify Products\n\nThe problem describes the decomposition of a salt mixture into gases, which are then identified by passing them through a series of analytical tubes.\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent. Its mass increased by 3.60 g, which is the mass of the water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   **Moles of H₂O** = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. The weight did not change, indicating **no acidic gases were produced**. This rules out salts containing carbonate, sulfite, etc.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar Mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   **Moles of O₂** = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n4.  **Gas C:** The remaining gas has a volume of 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   **Moles of Gas C** = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   To identify Gas C, we can use the law of conservation of mass. The initial mass (7.20 g) must equal the total mass of the products.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is **nitrogen (N₂)**.\n\nIn summary, the decomposition produced **0.20 mol H₂O**, **0.025 mol O₂**, and **0.10 mol N₂**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Salts A and B\n\nThe products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) show that the original salts must contain the elements H, O, and N. A common class of salts that decompose into these gases are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. Let's test the hypothesis that the salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\nThe relevant decomposition reactions are:\n*   **NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O**\n*   **2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O** (This pathway produces O₂, matching the experimental result).\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Hypothesis with Stoichiometry\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume it contains 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂ and 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n*   **Total O₂ produced:** Only NH₄NO₃ produces O₂. From the reaction `2NH₄NO₃ → O₂`, the molar ratio is 2:1. So, `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ produce `n/2` moles of O₂.\n    *   `n/2` = 0.025 mol  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**.\n*   This means the mixture contained **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃** and **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂**.\n\nLet's check if this is consistent with the other products:\n*   **Total N₂ produced:**\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: 0.05 mol N₂\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (ratio 2:2 or 1:1): 0.05 mol N₂\n    *   Total N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = **0.10 mol**. (Matches experiment)\n*   **Total H₂O produced:**\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ (ratio 1:2): 0.10 mol H₂O\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (ratio 2:4 or 1:2): 0.10 mol H₂O\n    *   Total H₂O = 0.10 + 0.10 = **0.20 mol**. (Matches experiment)\n\nThe hypothesis is fully consistent with the product quantities.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**\n\n**Total Atoms = 8 + 9 = 17**\n\nThis corresponds to option D. A review of the candidate answers shows that while many perform the correct chemical analysis to arrive at 17, they often select the wrong letter. The correct calculation leads to 17.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Identification and Quantification of Gaseous Products**\n\nThe first step is to use the experimental data to identify the gases produced during the decomposition and calculate their molar quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** The weight did not change, indicating that no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced. This rules out salts containing carbonate or other anions that would produce acidic gases upon decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** This tube reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining Gas):** The remaining volume is 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n*   **Identity of Gas C:** We can determine the identity of Gas C by using the law of conservation of mass. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂)\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Summary of Products:** The decomposition yielded 0.20 mol of H₂O, 0.025 mol of O₂, and 0.10 mol of N₂.\n\n### **2. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (N₂, H₂O, O₂) indicate the original salts must contain Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. Since they are salts, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. The most common candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nWe must check if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these two salts matches the product quantities.\n\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate:** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n    *   *Careful Point:* While ammonium nitrate typically decomposes to N₂O and H₂O at 200°C, the problem's evidence (production of O₂) forces the conclusion that this specific decomposition pathway occurred.\n\nLet's assume the equimolar mixture contains `n` moles of each salt.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O are produced.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃: `n` moles of N₂, `0.5n` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O are produced (based on the 1:1:0.5:2 molar ratio per mole of NH₄NO₃).\n\n**Total moles of products in terms of `n`:**\n*   Total N₂ = `n` + `n` = `2n`\n*   Total H₂O = `2n` + `2n` = `4n`\n*   Total O₂ = `0.5n`\n\nNow, we solve for `n` using the experimental values:\n*   From O₂: `0.5n` = 0.025 mol  => **`n` = 0.05 mol**\n*   Checking with N₂: `2n` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (This matches the experimental value).\n*   Checking with H₂O: `4n` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (This also matches).\n\nThe value `n` = 0.05 mol is consistent, confirming the salts are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃.\n\n### **3. Final Calculation: Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total Atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1.

Determine the Identity of Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nThe total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g) due to the law of conservation of mass.\n*   Mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n*   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n*   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n\nNow, we can calculate the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that is inert in this context is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition products are 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n**3. Deduce the Identities of Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) indicate the original salts contain the elements Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen.

Identify Salts A and B from the Products**\n\nThe decomposition produced 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂. The original salts must therefore contain the elements H, O, and N. Given they are salts, they are likely ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. The most plausible candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's examine their decomposition reactions that fit the products:\n*   **Reaction for Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Reaction for Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n**3. Verify the Hypothesis with Stoichiometry**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume it contains `x` moles of Salt A and `x` moles of Salt B.\n\n*   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₂, the products are: `x` mol N₂ and `2x` mol H₂O.\n*   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₃, the products are: `x` mol N₂, `0.5x` mol O₂, and `2x` mol H₂O.\n\nThe total moles of each product would be:\n*   Total N₂ = `x` + `x` = `2x`\n*   Total H₂O = `2x` + `2x` = `4x`\n*   Total O₂ = `0.5x`\n\nNow, we use our experimental values to solve for `x`:\n*   From O₂: `0.5x` = 0.025 mol  =>  **x = 0.05 mol**\n*   Let's check this value with the other products:\n    *   Total N₂ = `2x` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (This matches the experimental value).\n    *   Total H₂O = `4x` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (This also matches).\n\nThe calculations are consistent, confirming the mixture contained 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrite and 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrate.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\n*   Total Atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify Gaseous Products and Calculate Moles**\n\nThe problem provides data from passing the gaseous decomposition products through a series of analytical tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O absorbed = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tests for acidic gases (like CO₂).\n    *   The weight did not change, meaning **no acidic gases were produced**.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase is the mass of the oxygen gas.\n    *   Mass of O₂ reacted = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** This is the gas left after H₂O and O₂ are removed.\n    *   Volume = 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Verify Mass Conservation and Identify Gas C**\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that the initial mass of the salts must equal the total mass of the products.\n*   Initial mass = 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n*   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C: Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition products are: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n**3. Deduce the Identity of Salts A and B**\n\nThe products contain the elements H, O, and N. The salts must be composed of these elements. A common cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺), and the anions are likely nitrogen-oxygen compounds. The two most plausible salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's check their decomposition reactions:\n*   **NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O**\n*   **2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O** (This reaction produces O₂, matching the experimental findings).\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume it contains `n` moles of each salt.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂: produces `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃: produces `n` moles of N₂, `0.5n` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal moles of products in terms of `n`:\n*   Total N₂ = `n` + `n` = `2n`\n*   Total O₂ = `0.5n`\n*   Total H₂O = `2n` + `2n` = `4n`\n\nNow, we use our calculated moles to solve for `n`:\n*   From O₂: `0.5n` = 0.025 mol  =>  **`n` = 0.05 mol**.\n\nLet's verify this value of `n` with the other products:\n*   Check N₂: `2n` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (This matches the experimental value).\n*   Check H₂O: `4n` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (This also matches).\n\nThe hypothesis is correct. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrite and 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrate.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most perform the correct chemical analysis leading to the number 17, they often conclude with the wrong letter. Answer 5 correctly performs the analysis and concludes with the correct option.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nAn analysis of the provided answers and the original problem reveals a consistent and verifiable line of reasoning, despite some final conclusions being mismatched with their own logic. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the correct solution path.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Molar Quantities**\n\nThe problem provides data from a series of analytical tests on the gaseous decomposition products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution detects acidic gases like CO₂. The weight did not change, which is a crucial piece of negative evidence: no acidic gases were formed. This rules out salts containing anions like carbonate or sulfite.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen gas that reacted.\n    *   Molar Mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining Gas):** After the other components were removed, 2.24 L of gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Molar Volume at STP = 22.4 L/mol\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**\n    *   To confirm the identity of Gas C, we can use the law of conservation of mass. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n        *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g (total) - 3.60 g (H₂O) - 0.80 g (O₂) = 2.80 g\n        *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that is inert in this context is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Deduce the Identity of Salts A and B**\n\nThe products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. The original salts must therefore contain Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen. Since they are salts, a logical hypothesis is that they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. The two most common candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. The mixture is equimolar, so let's assume it contains `n` moles of each salt.\n\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ produce `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate:** The reaction that produces O₂ is 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g).\n    *   This means 1 mole of NH₄NO₃ produces 1 mole of N₂, 0.5 moles of O₂, and 2 moles of H₂O.\n    *   `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ produce `n` moles of N₂, `0.5n` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\n**3. Verify the Hypothesis with Stoichiometry**\n\nLet's sum the total moles of each product from the decomposition of `n` moles of each salt:\n*   Total Moles O₂ = `0.5n` (only from NH₄NO₃)\n*   Total Moles N₂ = `n` (from NH₄NO₂) + `n` (from NH₄NO₃) = `2n`\n*   Total Moles H₂O = `2n` (from NH₄NO₂) + `2n` (from NH₄NO₃) = `4n`\n\nNow, we use our experimental values to solve for `n`:\n*   From O₂: `0.5n` = 0.025 mol  => **`n` = 0.05 mol**\n\nLet's check if this value of `n` is consistent with the other products:\n*   Check N₂: `2n` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. This matches the experimental value.\n*   Check H₂O: `4n` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. This also matches the experimental value.\n\nThe hypothesis is confirmed. The mixture consists of 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrite and 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrate.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify Gaseous Products and Quantities:** The first step is to accurately determine the identity and molar amount of each gaseous product formed from the decomposition.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater. The fact that its weight did not change is a crucial negative result, proving that no acidic gases (like CO₂ or SO₂) were produced. This rules out salts containing carbonate or sulfite anions.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen gas that reacted.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Gas C:** This is the remaining gas after all reactions. Its volume is 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n2.  **Verify with Mass Conservation and Identify Gas C:** The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n    *   Mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now, we can find the molar mass of Gas C: Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A gas that is inert in this context and has a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n3.  **Deduce the Identity of the Salts:** The products are N₂, H₂O, and O₂. The original salts must therefore contain the elements N, H, and O. Since they are salts, a logical hypothesis is that they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. The two most common candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). We must check if their decomposition reactions match the products.\n    *   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   **Ammonium Nitrate:** While it often decomposes to N₂O and H₂O, the presence of O₂ in the products points to a different decomposition pathway: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g). This reaction is known to occur and fits the observed products.\n\n4.  **Verify with Stoichiometry:** The problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume there are 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂ and 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃.\n    *   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂: produces **n** moles of N₂ and **2n** moles of H₂O.\n    *   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the second reaction): produces **n** moles of N₂, **0.5n** moles of O₂, and **2n** moles of H₂O.\n    *   **Total moles produced:**\n        *   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n        *   Total O₂ = 0.5n\n        *   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n    *   **Solve for 'n' using the experimental data:**\n        *   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**.\n        *   Check with N₂: 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. This matches the experiment.\n        *   Check with H₂O: 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. This also matches the experiment.\n    *   The consistent value of n = 0.05 mol confirms the identity of the salts and their quantities.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:** The question asks for the total number of atoms in the formula units of salts A and B.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total Atoms** = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
