Rounding to three significant figures (consistent with the input data), the result is **6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M**.\n\nWe now compare this definitive result to the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M**\n*   B) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n*   C) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n*   D) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value is an exact match for option A.

The candidate answers provided show a strong consensus on the calculation methodology but confusion in matching the result to the correct lettered option, likely due to seeing differently ordered lists of answers.\n\n### Analysis of the Chemical System and Calculation Steps\n\n1.  **Calculate Initial Molar Concentrations of Buffer Components:**\n    The first step is to find the molar concentrations of the weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻) that form the buffer.\n    *   **Volume:** 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n    *   **Moles of H₂PO₄⁻** from 1.00 g KH₂PO₄ (Mw = 136.09 g/mol):\n        Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n        [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ **0.03674 M**\n    *   **Moles of HPO₄²⁻** from 1.00 g Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol):\n        Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n        [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ **0.02809 M**\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O) as given. This calculation is performed correctly by all candidate answers.\n\n2.  **Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]**:\n    The [H⁺] is controlled by the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ buffer equilibrium, which is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (governed by Ka₂).\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   Equilibrium constant expression: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻] = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n        [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ **8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This step establishes the fixed [H⁺] of the solution that will, in turn, control the final equilibrium. This calculation is also performed correctly and consistently by all agents.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]**:\n    The concentration of PO₄³⁻ is determined by the third dissociation step (governed by Ka₃), using the [H⁺] established by the buffer.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   Equilibrium constant expression: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻] = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   Plugging in the known values:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M) ≈ **6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Since Ka₃ is extremely small, we can assume the equilibrium concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] is equal to its initial concentration. The calculation yields the final answer.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculation robustly yields a concentration of approximately **6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M** for the orthophosphate ion. This numerical result is consistently achieved by all candidate answers that show their derivation.\n\nNow, we compare this value to the options provided in the question:\nA) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated result directly matches option D.
