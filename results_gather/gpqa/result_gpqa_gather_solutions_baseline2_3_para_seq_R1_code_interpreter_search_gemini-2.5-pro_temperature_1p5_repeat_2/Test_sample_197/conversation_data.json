Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, among all cobalt-containing species. This is equivalent to finding the mole fraction of this species, denoted `α₂`, and multiplying by 100.\n\n**2. Formulate the Governing Equation**\nThe mole fraction of a specific complex `[MLₙ]` (where M is the metal, L is the ligand, and n is the number of ligands) is determined by the free ligand concentration `[L]` and the overall stability constants `β`. The general formula is:\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\nThe sum in the denominator runs over all possible complexes (from `i`=1 to the maximum, `N`). The '1' term represents the free metal ion `M`, for which `β₀` is defined as 1.\n\nFor the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate `α₂`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Perform the Calculation**\nWe are given the following values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, we calculate all the terms in the denominator:\n*   Term for free Co²⁺: **1**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × 0.1² = **0.4**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × 0.1³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × 0.1⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nNow, we sum the denominator:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nFinally, we calculate the mole fraction `α₂` and convert it to a percentage:\n*   `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n*   Percentage = `α₂` × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Total vs. Free Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total metal ion concentration (0.01 M), it is a valid and standard assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` with its total concentration, 0.1 M.\n2.  **Irrelevance of Total Metal Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not needed to calculate the *relative percentage* of a species. It would be required to find the absolute concentration, but not the fraction.\n3.  **Completeness of the Denominator**: It is crucial to include the term for the free ion (`1`) and the terms for *all* possible complexes (`[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`) in the denominator to correctly represent the total amount of cobalt species.\n4.  **Matching Result to Options**: After performing the calculation and arriving at the numerical answer (~16.9%), it is essential to match this value correctly to the given multiple-choice options. A review of the candidate answers shows that they all successfully performed the calculation, but the inconsistent final letters (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`) are due to the options being listed in a different order for each of them.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a result of approximately 16.9%. Matching this result to the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) 16.9%**\n*   B) 25.6%\n*   C) 42.3%\n*   D) 38.1%\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe analysis and calculation are now complete and have been computationally verified.\n\n**1. Problem Breakdown:** The task is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, in a solution with known stability constants and ligand concentration.\n\n**2. Formula and Calculation:** The mole fraction `α₂` is calculated using the standard formula:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n*   **Inputs:**\n    *   β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   **Numerator:** `40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n*   **Denominator:** `1 + (9*0.1) + (40*0.1²) + (63*0.1³) + (16*0.1⁴) = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n*   **Result:** `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**3. Computational Verification:** The Python code executed confirms the calculation:\n`The calculated percentage is: 16.916180326482287%`\n\n**4.

This matches option B in the provided list.\n\nA) 38.1%\nB) 16.9%\nC) 25.6%\nD) 42.3%\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n### **Analysis and Final Decision**\n\n1.  **Verification of Calculation**: The Python code executed in the previous step provides a precise calculation of the percentage.\n    ```\n    Code output: The calculated percentage is: 16.916180326482287%\n    ```\n    This confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is approximately **16.9%**.\n\n2.  **Consensus Analysis**: As noted in the initial analysis, all 15 candidate agents correctly identified the required formula and performed the calculation to arrive at the same numerical result of ~16.9%. This shows an extremely high degree of confidence in the underlying chemical principles and the mathematical steps.\n\n3.  **Error Identification**: The discrepancies among the candidate answers are not in the calculation itself but in matching the result to the multiple-choice options. The options (A, B, C, D) were presented differently in the context of different answers, leading to incorrect letter selections.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion**: The calculation is robustly confirmed to be ~16.9%. We must match this result with the options as they are presented in the original question:\n    *   A) 42.3%\n    *   B) 25.6%\n    *   C) 38.1%\n    *   **D) 16.9%**\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% directly corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of a specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This is known as the mole fraction (`α₂`) expressed as a percentage.\n\n**2. Identify the Chemical Principles and Formula**\nIn a solution where a metal ion (`Co²⁺`) and a ligand (`SCN⁻`) are present, a series of complexation equilibria will be established. The distribution of the different species (`Co²⁺`, `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, etc.) depends on the free ligand concentration and the overall stability constants (βn) for each complex.\n\nThe mole fraction of the n-th complex, `αₙ`, is given by the formula:\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\nwhere `[L]` is the free ligand concentration, and the sum `Σ` in the denominator runs over all possible complexes (from i=1 to 4). The `1` in the denominator represents the free `Co²⁺` ion, for which β₀ is defined as 1.\n\nFor this problem, we need to calculate `α₂`:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. Identify Careful Points and Assumptions**\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The total thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, while the total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M (or 0.01 M). Since the ligand is in 10-fold excess, the amount that binds to cobalt is small compared to the total. Therefore, it is a valid and standard assumption to approximate the free (equilibrium) ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` with the total concentration, i.e., `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n*   **Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed to calculate the *relative percentage* or mole fraction, as it cancels out during the derivation of the formula.\n*   **Denominator Term:** A common mistake is to forget the `1` in the denominator. This `1` represents the fraction of free metal ions `Co²⁺` and is essential for the calculation.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nUsing the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator term:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate each term in the denominator:\n*   Term for `Co²⁺`: 1\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × (0.1)¹ = 0.9\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n\nNow, sum the denominator terms:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nFinally, calculate the mole fraction `α₂`:\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**5. Convert to Percentage and Select the Answer**\nTo find the percentage, multiply the mole fraction by 100:\n*   Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 0.16916 × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nNow, compare this result to the options given in the main question:\nA) 25.6%\nB) 42.3%\nC) 38.1%\nD) 16.9%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the problem and a review of the candidate answers, here is a breakdown of the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of a specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This relative amount is known as the mole fraction, expressed as a percentage.\n\n**2. Identify the Chemical Principles and Formula**\nIn a solution containing a metal ion (`Co²⁺`) and a ligand (`SCN⁻`), a series of complexes form in equilibrium. The mole fraction (`αₙ`) of a specific complex with 'n' ligands (`[Co(SCN)ₙ]`) can be calculated using the following formula, which depends on the overall stability constants (`βᵢ`) and the free ligand concentration `[L]`:\n\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ[L]ⁱ))`\n\nFor our target complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, n=2. The formula becomes:\n\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. State and Justify Assumptions**\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The total concentration of the ligand thiocyanate is `[SCN⁻]total = 0.1 M`. The total concentration of the metal is `c(Co) = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M`. Since the ligand is in a 10-fold excess, the amount of ligand that gets bound in complexes is small compared to the total. Therefore, we can validly approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` at equilibrium as its total concentration, 0.1 M.\n*   **Total Cobalt Concentration:** The formula for the mole fraction calculates a relative percentage. The total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed for the calculation as it cancels out in the derivation of the formula.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nWe substitute the given values into the formula:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\n**Step-by-step calculation:**\n*   **Calculate the Numerator:** This is the term corresponding to the desired complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n    `Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n*   **Calculate the Denominator:** This is the sum of terms for all possible species.\n    *   Term for `Co²⁺` (free ion): `1`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × (0.1)¹ = 0.9`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n\n*   **Sum of the Denominator:**\n    `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n*   **Calculate the Mole Fraction (`α₂`) and Percentage:**\n    `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n    `Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916%`\n\n**5.

This is a standard problem in coordination chemistry involving complexation equilibria.\n\n### **Careful Points & Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** We need to find the percentage of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species relative to all other cobalt-containing species. This is calculated as the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]`, denoted by `α₂`, multiplied by 100.\n\n2.  **The Correct Formula:** The mole fraction of a complex with 'n' ligands, `[MLₙ]`, is given by the formula involving the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[L]`.\n    `αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ[L]ⁱ))`\n    For our specific case (`n=2`), the formula is:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n3.  **Check Key Assumptions:**\n    *   **Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. We are given the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total metal concentration (10⁻² M or 0.01 M), it is a valid and standard approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration. Thus, `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n    *   **Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed for the calculation of a *relative* percentage, as it cancels out in the mole fraction formula.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** We will substitute the given values into the formula:\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16\n\n    First, calculate the numerator:\n    *   **Numerator** = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    Next, calculate each term in the denominator.

The mole fraction represents the concentration of the species of interest divided by the total concentration of all cobalt species.\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Principle and Formula:** In a solution with a metal ion and a ligand, a series of complexes form in equilibrium. The distribution of these species is a function of the free ligand concentration and the overall stability constants (βn) for each complex. The mole fraction (`αₙ`) of a particular species `[MLₙ]` is calculated by the following formula:\n\n    αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n\n    For our specific problem, we want to find `α₂` for `[Co(SCN)₂]`. Thus, M = Co²⁺, L = SCN⁻, and n = 2.

Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is written as `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all species containing cobalt in the solution. This is equivalent to finding the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]` and expressing it as a percentage.\n\n**2. Identify the Core Principle and Formula**\nIn a solution where a metal ion (`M`) and a ligand (`L`) form a series of complexes, the distribution of species can be calculated using their overall stability constants (`βₙ`) and the free ligand concentration (`[L]`). The mole fraction (`αₙ`) of a specific complex `[MLₙ]` is given by:\n\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n\nFor this problem, we need to find `α₂` for `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. List Careful Points and Assumptions**\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* (unbound) ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* concentration (0.1 M). Because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), it is a standard and valid approximation to assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration. So, `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n*   **Total Metal Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation itself, as the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out. Its main purpose here is to justify the ligand concentration assumption above.\n*   **Stability Constants:** The provided `β` values are overall stability constants, which are the correct type to use in this formula.\n*   **Final Answer Format:** The question asks for a percentage, which is the calculated mole fraction `α₂` multiplied by 100.\n\n**4.

This requires calculating the mole fraction (`α₂`) of this species and then converting it to a percentage.\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Formula:** The distribution of species in a complexation equilibrium is described by mole fractions (`α`). The formula for the mole fraction of the n-th complex, `[MLₙ]`, is:\n    `αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ[L]ⁱ))`\n    where `β` represents the overall stability constants, `[L]` is the concentration of the free ligand, and the summation `Σ` in the denominator runs over all possible complexes (from i=1 to i=4 in this case). The `1` in the denominator represents the free metal ion, `Co²⁺` (where i=0 and β₀=1).\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to the Problem:** We are interested in the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex, so we need to calculate `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** We substitute the given values into the formula.\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n    First, calculate the numerator:\n    *   Numerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    Next, calculate each term of the denominator:\n    *   Term for `Co²⁺`: 1\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 × (0.1)¹ = 0.9\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    Now, calculate the mole fraction `α₂`:\n    *   `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    Finally, convert the mole fraction to a percentage:\n    *   Percentage = `α₂` × 100% ≈ 0.16916 × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n5.  **Match with Options:** The calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%.

    "This is a standard coordination chemistry problem that requires calculating the distribution of species in equilibrium. The goal is to find the percentage of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the relative percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex. This is determined by its mole fraction, denoted `α₂`, which is the concentration of `[Co(SCN)₂]` divided by the total concentration of all cobalt species (`c(Co)`). The result is then multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.\n\n**2. Identify the Correct Formula**\nThe mole fraction of a complex with 'n' ligands (`[MLₙ]`) in a solution with a free ligand concentration of `[L]` is calculated using the overall stability constants (`βₙ`). The formula is:\n\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n\nFor our specific case, we want to find α₂ for `[Co(SCN)₂]`, where M=Co, L=SCN, and n=2.

Address Careful Points and Assumptions**\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The formula uses the *free* (unbound) ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem gives the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total metal concentration (10⁻² M or 0.01 M), the ligand is in large excess. This makes it a standard and valid approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to its total concentration. Therefore, we use `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`. All candidate agents correctly identified and applied this key assumption.\n*   **Total Metal Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` = 10⁻² M is not required to calculate the *relative percentage* or mole fraction. It is mainly used to justify the ligand concentration assumption above.\n*   **Denominator Components:** It is crucial to include the '1' term for the free `Co²⁺` ion and terms for all possible complexes in the denominator to correctly normalize the fraction.\n\n**4.

Perform the Calculation**\nWe are given the following values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, we calculate all the terms in the denominator:\n*   Term for free Co²⁺: **1**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × 0.1² = **0.4**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × 0.1³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × 0.1⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nNow, we sum the denominator:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nFinally, we calculate the mole fraction `α₂` and convert it to a percentage:\n*   `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n*   Percentage = `α₂` × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Total vs. Free Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total metal ion concentration (0.01 M), it is a valid and standard assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` with its total concentration, 0.1 M.\n2.  **Irrelevance of Total Metal Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not needed to calculate the *relative percentage* of a species. It would be required to find the absolute concentration, but not the fraction.\n3.  **Completeness of the Denominator**: It is crucial to include the term for the free ion (`1`) and the terms for *all* possible complexes (`[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`) in the denominator to correctly represent the total amount of cobalt species.\n4.  **Matching Result to Options**: After performing the calculation and arriving at the numerical answer (~16.9%), it is essential to match this value correctly to the given multiple-choice options. A review of the candidate answers shows that they all successfully performed the calculation, but the inconsistent final letters (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`) are due to the options being listed in a different order for each of them.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a result of approximately 16.9%.

Formula and Calculation:** The mole fraction `α₂` is calculated using the standard formula:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n*   **Inputs:**\n    *   β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   **Numerator:** `40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n*   **Denominator:** `1 + (9*0.1) + (40*0.1²) + (63*0.1³) + (16*0.1⁴) = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n*   **Result:** `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**3.

Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of a specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This is known as the mole fraction (`α₂`) expressed as a percentage.\n\n**2. Identify the Chemical Principles and Formula**\nIn a solution where a metal ion (`Co²⁺`) and a ligand (`SCN⁻`) are present, a series of complexation equilibria will be established. The distribution of the different species (`Co²⁺`, `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, etc.) depends on the free ligand concentration and the overall stability constants (βn) for each complex.\n\nThe mole fraction of the n-th complex, `αₙ`, is given by the formula:\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\nwhere `[L]` is the free ligand concentration, and the sum `Σ` in the denominator runs over all possible complexes (from i=1 to 4). The `1` in the denominator represents the free `Co²⁺` ion, for which β₀ is defined as 1.\n\nFor this problem, we need to calculate `α₂`:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. Identify Careful Points and Assumptions**\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The total thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, while the total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M (or 0.01 M). Since the ligand is in 10-fold excess, the amount that binds to cobalt is small compared to the total. Therefore, it is a valid and standard assumption to approximate the free (equilibrium) ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` with the total concentration, i.e., `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n*   **Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed to calculate the *relative percentage* or mole fraction, as it cancels out during the derivation of the formula.\n*   **Denominator Term:** A common mistake is to forget the `1` in the denominator. This `1` represents the fraction of free metal ions `Co²⁺` and is essential for the calculation.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nUsing the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator term:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate each term in the denominator:\n*   Term for `Co²⁺`: 1\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × (0.1)¹ = 0.9\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n\nNow, sum the denominator terms:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nFinally, calculate the mole fraction `α₂`:\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**5. Convert to Percentage and Select the Answer**\nTo find the percentage, multiply the mole fraction by 100:\n*   Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 0.16916 × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nNow, compare this result to the options given in the main question:\nA) 25.6%\nB) 42.3%\nC) 38.1%\nD) 16.9%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the problem and a review of the candidate answers, here is a breakdown of the solution.\n\n**1.

The mole fraction (`αₙ`) of a specific complex with 'n' ligands (`[Co(SCN)ₙ]`) can be calculated using the following formula, which depends on the overall stability constants (`βᵢ`) and the free ligand concentration `[L]`:\n\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ[L]ⁱ))`\n\nFor our target complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, n=2. The formula becomes:\n\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. State and Justify Assumptions**\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The total concentration of the ligand thiocyanate is `[SCN⁻]total = 0.1 M`. The total concentration of the metal is `c(Co) = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M`. Since the ligand is in a 10-fold excess, the amount of ligand that gets bound in complexes is small compared to the total. Therefore, we can validly approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` at equilibrium as its total concentration, 0.1 M.\n*   **Total Cobalt Concentration:** The formula for the mole fraction calculates a relative percentage. The total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed for the calculation as it cancels out in the derivation of the formula.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nWe substitute the given values into the formula:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\n**Step-by-step calculation:**\n*   **Calculate the Numerator:** This is the term corresponding to the desired complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n    `Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n*   **Calculate the Denominator:** This is the sum of terms for all possible species.\n    *   Term for `Co²⁺` (free ion): `1`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × (0.1)¹ = 0.9`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n\n*   **Sum of the Denominator:**\n    `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n*   **Calculate the Mole Fraction (`α₂`) and Percentage:**\n    `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n    `Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916%`\n\n**5.

This is calculated as the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]`, denoted by `α₂`, multiplied by 100.\n\n2.  **The Correct Formula:** The mole fraction of a complex with 'n' ligands, `[MLₙ]`, is given by the formula involving the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[L]`.\n    `αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ[L]ⁱ))`\n    For our specific case (`n=2`), the formula is:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n3.  **Check Key Assumptions:**\n    *   **Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. We are given the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total metal concentration (10⁻² M or 0.01 M), it is a valid and standard approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration. Thus, `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n    *   **Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed for the calculation of a *relative* percentage, as it cancels out in the mole fraction formula.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** We will substitute the given values into the formula:\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16\n\n    First, calculate the numerator:\n    *   **Numerator** = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    Next, calculate each term in the denominator.

The mole fraction represents the concentration of the species of interest divided by the total concentration of all cobalt species.\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Principle and Formula:** In a solution with a metal ion and a ligand, a series of complexes form in equilibrium. The distribution of these species is a function of the free ligand concentration and the overall stability constants (βn) for each complex. The mole fraction (`αₙ`) of a particular species `[MLₙ]` is calculated by the following formula:\n\n    αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n\n    For our specific problem, we want to find `α₂` for `[Co(SCN)₂]`.

Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is written as `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all species containing cobalt in the solution. This is equivalent to finding the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]` and expressing it as a percentage.\n\n**2. Identify the Core Principle and Formula**\nIn a solution where a metal ion (`M`) and a ligand (`L`) form a series of complexes, the distribution of species can be calculated using their overall stability constants (`βₙ`) and the free ligand concentration (`[L]`). The mole fraction (`αₙ`) of a specific complex `[MLₙ]` is given by:\n\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n\nFor this problem, we need to find `α₂` for `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. List Careful Points and Assumptions**\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* (unbound) ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* concentration (0.1 M). Because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), it is a standard and valid approximation to assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration. So, `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n*   **Total Metal Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation itself, as the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out. Its main purpose here is to justify the ligand concentration assumption above.\n*   **Stability Constants:** The provided `β` values are overall stability constants, which are the correct type to use in this formula.\n*   **Final Answer Format:** The question asks for a percentage, which is the calculated mole fraction `α₂` multiplied by 100.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nUsing the given values:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\n**Calculate the Numerator:**\nNumerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n**Calculate the Denominator (the sum of terms for all species):**\n*   Term for `Co²⁺` (n=0, β₀=1): **1**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (n=1): `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 × (0.1)¹ = **0.9**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (n=2): `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (n=3): `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (n=4): `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nSum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n**Calculate the Mole Fraction and Percentage:**\n`α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\nPercentage = `α₂` × 100% ≈ 16.916%\n\n**5. Final Decision**\nThe calculated percentage is approximately **16.9%**. All candidate answers reached this same numerical conclusion, confirming the robustness of the calculation. The discrepancies in their final letter choice arose from processing different lists of options.

This suggests that the options may have been presented in a different order to different agents, leading to clerical errors in the final selection. However, the underlying scientific and mathematical reasoning is unanimously correct.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\nTo resolve the discrepancy and determine the definitive answer based on the problem statement provided, the calculation is performed below.\n\n**1.

State the Governing Formula**\nThe mole fraction (αₙ) of a complex `[MLₙ]` is given by:\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\nFor the target species, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need `α₂`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Identify and Use Given Values**\n*   Stability constants: `β₁=9`, `β₂=40`, `β₃=63`, `β₄=16`\n*   Thiocyanate concentration: `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n\n*   **Numerator Calculation**: This represents the term for the desired complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n    Numerator = `β₂ × [SCN⁻]²` = `40 × (0.1)²` = `40 × 0.01` = **0.4**\n\n*   **Denominator Calculation**: This represents the sum of terms for all possible cobalt species.\n    Denominator = `1` (for free Co²⁺) + `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` + `β₂[SCN⁻]²` + `β₃[SCN⁻]³` + `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴`\n    Denominator = `1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)`\n    Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n    Denominator = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation**:\n    `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = `0.4 / 2.3646` ≈ `0.16916`\n\n*   **Convert to Percentage**:\n    Percentage = `α₂ × 100%` ≈ `0.16916 × 100%` ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Conclusion and Final Answer\n\nThe calculation robustly and unambiguously yields a value of **16.9%**. According to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 42.3%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 25.6%\nD) 16.9%\n\nThe calculated result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers and a rigorous step-by-step evaluation of the problem, here is a detailed breakdown.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to calculate the percentage of one specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)₂]`, out of the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This requires calculating the mole fraction (`α₂`) of this species and then converting it to a percentage.\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Formula:** The distribution of species in a complexation equilibrium is described by mole fractions (`α`). The formula for the mole fraction of the n-th complex, `[MLₙ]`, is:\n    `αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ[L]ⁱ))`\n    where `β` represents the overall stability constants, `[L]` is the concentration of the free ligand, and the summation `Σ` in the denominator runs over all possible complexes (from i=1 to i=4 in this case). The `1` in the denominator represents the free metal ion, `Co²⁺` (where i=0 and β₀=1).\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to the Problem:** We are interested in the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex, so we need to calculate `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** We substitute the given values into the formula.\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n    First, calculate the numerator:\n    *   Numerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    Next, calculate each term of the denominator:\n    *   Term for `Co²⁺`: 1\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 × (0.1)¹ = 0.9\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    Now, calculate the mole fraction `α₂`:\n    *   `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    Finally, convert the mole fraction to a percentage:\n    *   Percentage = `α₂` × 100% ≈ 0.16916 × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n5.  **Match with Options:** The calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%. According to the options provided in the original question prompt, this corresponds to option A.\n    *   A) 16.9%\n    *   B) 25.6%\n    *   C) 38.1%\n    *   D) 42.3%\n\n**Careful Points to Note**\n\n*   **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration. However, since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), it is a valid and necessary approximation to assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the total ligand concentration.\n*   **Total Metal Ion Concentration**: The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not needed for this specific calculation. The question asks for a relative percentage (or mole fraction), and the term for the free metal ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out during the derivation of the mole fraction formula.\n*   **Consensus Analysis**: All 15 candidate answers correctly identified the method and performed the calculation, unanimously arriving at the numerical result of ~16.9%. The inconsistencies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) arose from being presented with differently ordered lists of the multiple-choice options.
