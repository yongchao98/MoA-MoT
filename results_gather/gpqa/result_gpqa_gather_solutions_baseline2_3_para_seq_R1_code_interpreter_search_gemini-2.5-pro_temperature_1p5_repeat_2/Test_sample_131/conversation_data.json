Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, let's establish a clear understanding of the information provided by the spectrum for the 1:1 molar mixture:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows **two signals**, both are **singlets**, and they have a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   This indicates the mixture contains two compounds with different aromatic proton environments.\n    *   Because the mixture is 1:1 and the signals have a 1:1 integration ratio, the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity is a critical clue, meaning the aromatic protons in question are not adjacent to any non-equivalent protons (i.e., they are isolated).\n\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows **three signals**, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   The fact that all alkyl signals are \"singlets\" is a major constraint. It means none of the alkyl protons are subject to spin-spin splitting from adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This is characteristic of methyl groups on a substituted benzene ring but rules out groups like ethyl (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio describes the relative number of protons contributing to the three distinct alkyl environments found in the mixture. Since there are 14 protons per molecule, the total number of protons is 28. Twelve of these are methyl protons, so the total in the alkyl region is 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to signals with relative integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **2. Analyze Each Candidate Compound Individually**\n\nThe next step is to predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound contains two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). Due to spin-spin coupling, the -CH₂- protons would appear as a **quartet** and the -CH₃ protons would appear as a **triplet**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This directly contradicts the experimental data stating that all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately ruled out**, which eliminates option D.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and isolated. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to the high symmetry. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent (but different from the first pair). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule is asymmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments and are isolated. They would produce **two distinct singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all in unique environments, which would be expected to produce four singlets (each 3H), or fewer due to accidental overlap.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which of the remaining 1:1 mixtures produces the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. This mixture would show a total of **three** aromatic signals. This **does not match** the observed two signals.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. This mixture would also show a total of **three** aromatic signals. This **does not match** the observed data.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n        *   A 1:1 mixture results in **two aromatic singlets**. Since each signal comes from 2 protons and the molar ratio is 1:1, their integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet of 12H.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides two singlets of 6H each.\n        *   The combined mixture will show a total of **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n        *   The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, precisely accounts for all the features of the observed ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination explains the two 1:1 aromatic singlets and the three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlaps.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a detailed, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nFirst, let's break down what the provided experimental data tells us about the 1:1 molar mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both components are isomers with the formula C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidate molecules fit this description.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   There are **three** distinct signals.\n    *   The multiplicity of all three signals is **singlet**. This is a crucial clue. The presence of only singlets indicates that the protons giving rise to these signals are not coupled to any non-equivalent adjacent protons. This immediately brings ethyl groups into question, as an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) would produce a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin splitting.\n    *   The integration ratio is **2:1:1**. Since this is a 1:1 mixture of C₁₀H₁₄ isomers, the total number of methyl protons is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio represents 4 parts (2+1+1). Therefore, the actual number of protons for each signal is (2/4)*24H = **12H**, (1/4)*24H = **6H**, and (1/4)*24H = **6H**.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   There are **two** distinct signals.\n    *   Both are **singlets**.\n    *   The integration ratio is **1:1**. In a 1:1 molar mixture, this means the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe will now analyze each candidate based on its molecular structure and symmetry to predict its individual NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule contains two ethyl groups. As established in Step 1, these groups would produce a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region. This contradicts the experimental data.\n    *   **Conclusion: 1,4-diethylbenzene can be definitively ruled out.** This eliminates option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. Equivalent protons do not split each other, resulting in **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent due to reflection across the plane. This results in **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (equivalent by reflection), the unique methyl at C2 (on the plane), and the unique methyl at C5 (on the plane). This results in **three singlets** with integrations of **6H, 3H, and 3H**, respectively (a 2:1:1 ratio for the pure compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in the remaining options (A, B, D) to see which one matches the experimental data.\n\n**Required Mixture Spectrum:**\n*   Aromatic: Two 1:1 singlets. (Since all three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce a 2H singlet, any 1:1 mixture of two of them will satisfy this).\n*   Alkyl: Three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's test the combinations:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from Durene: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Alkyl signals from Isodurene: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined spectrum: This mixture would produce **four** signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from Durene: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   Alkyl signals from Prehnitene: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Combined spectrum: The mixture gives a total of **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from Prehnitene: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Alkyl signals from Isodurene: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined spectrum: This would have up to five signals, or if the 6H signals overlap, it would be one 18H signal and two 3H signals (a ratio of 6:1:1). This does not match.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described ¹H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination directly accounts for both the aromatic and alkyl region signals without needing to assume any coincidental signal overlaps.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information**\n\nFirst, let's establish a clear set of requirements from the provided ¹H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula**: Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄.\n*   **Aromatic Region**: The spectrum shows **two signals**, both are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**. This means the mixture contains two compounds, each with a different aromatic proton environment. Since the mixture and signal ratio are both 1:1, the number of protons giving rise to each singlet must be the same.\n*   **Alkyl Region**: The spectrum shows **three signals**, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**. The \"singlet\" multiplicity is critical. The 2:1:1 ratio describes the relative number of protons in the three distinct alkyl environments found in the mixture. Since a 1:1 mixture of C₁₀H₁₄ isomers contains 24 alkyl protons (12 from each compound), a 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) means the signals must correspond to integrations of **12H**, **6H**, and **6H**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nNext, we must predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on their molecular structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The protons on the adjacent carbons will couple via spin-spin splitting, producing a characteristic **quartet** (for the CH₂) and **triplet** (for the CH₃) in the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This directly contradicts the experimental data, which states all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This immediately rules out **Option D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Signal**: The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals**: All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Signal**: The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are equivalent. In these simplified systems, adjacent equivalent protons appear as a single signal. This gives **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals**: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic Signal**: The protons at C4 and C6 are reflected by this plane, making them equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the single methyl at C2 (3H), and the single methyl at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H ratio, which is **2:1:1**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) satisfies the spectral requirements. The decision will primarily rest on the alkyl signals, as they are more distinctive.\n\n*   **Requirement:** Three alkyl singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Prehnitene provides: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene provides: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: This would produce at least four signals (up to three 6H signals and two 3H signals). This does not match the requirement of three signals with a 12H:6H:6H integration.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Durene provides: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene provides: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: This would produce four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the requirement of three signals with a 12H:6H:6H integration.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this creates two distinct signals, each integrating to 2H. This matches the **two singlets, 1:1 ratio** requirement.\n    *   **Alkyl Check:**\n        *   Durene provides **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   Prehnitene provides **two singlets (6H each)**.\n        *   Combined Result: The mixture has exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the requirement.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only option that directly and perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a systematic, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectral Data**\n\nWe must first translate the provided 1H NMR data into structural requirements for the two compounds in the 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula**: C10H14. All four candidate molecules fit this.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**: The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity is a crucial clue. It indicates that the protons giving rise to these signals are not split by adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately calls into question any compound containing an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), which would show a characteristic quartet and triplet.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**: The spectrum shows **two singlets** with a **1:1** integration ratio.\n    *   This implies the two compounds in the mixture have distinct aromatic proton environments.\n    *   Because the molar ratio of the compounds is 1:1 and the signal integration is 1:1, the number of protons contributing to each of the two aromatic singlets must be identical.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nNow, we will predict the spectrum of each individual compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n    *   This compound contains two ethyl groups. As explained in Step 1, the ethyl groups will produce a **quartet** and a **triplet** in the alkyl region due to proton-proton coupling.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This contradicts the data stating all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene is not present in the mixture. This definitively rules out **Option B**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent proton neighbors. This produces **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons**: All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. This produces **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are equivalent due to symmetry. Although adjacent, in a symmetric system, they appear as a **single singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons**: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**:\n    *   Regardless of its exact spectrum, a mixture containing this compound will not match the observed data (as shown in Step 3). For example, some analyses predict two 1H aromatic singlets. If this compound were present, it would lead to a total of three aromatic signals in a mixture with either Durene or Prehnitene, which contradicts the \"two signals\" observation.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives:\n1.  **Aromatic Spectrum**: Two singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n2.  **Alkyl Spectrum**: Three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. The total alkyl protons in a 1:1 mixture is 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24H means the signals must integrate to **12H**, **6H**, and **6H**.\n\nLet's test the remaining valid options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**: As noted above, this mixture would result in three aromatic signals, which does not match the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**: This mixture would also result in three aromatic signals, which does not match the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**:\n    *   **Aromatic Signals**: Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Prehnitene contributes another distinct 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture yields exactly **two singlets**. Since each arises from 2 protons, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals**: Durene contributes **one singlet of 12H**. Prehnitene contributes **two singlets of 6H each**. The combined mixture gives exactly **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** is the only one that directly and completely accounts for all features of the observed 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a systematic, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct mixture of compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Information from the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nFirst, we must fully understand the clues provided by the spectral data for the 1:1 molar mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula**: Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**: There are two signals.\n    *   **Multiplicity**: Both are singlets. This indicates the aromatic protons are not coupled to adjacent, non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **Integration Ratio**: 1:1. Since it's a 1:1 mixture of isomers, this means the number of protons giving rise to each signal is identical.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**: There are three signals.\n    *   **Multiplicity**: All are singlets. This is a crucial constraint. It rules out any alkyl groups that would show coupling, such as the ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) which produces a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Integration Ratio**: 2:1:1. This represents the relative number of protons in the three distinct alkyl environments found in the total mixture.\n\n### **2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Candidate**\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to accurately predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each potential compound based on its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n    *   This compound contains two ethyl groups. An ethyl group gives a **quartet** and a **triplet** in the alkyl region due to proton-proton coupling.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This contradicts the data stating all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene is **eliminated** as a possibility. Option B can be discarded.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. Equivalent adjacent protons in such a system appear as a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (the pair at C1/C4) and (the pair at C2/C3). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons (at C4 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which is **2:1:1**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe now compare the combined spectra of the pairs in the options against the experimental data. The deciding factor will be the alkyl region signals.\n\n*   **Data Requirement (Alkyl Region)**: Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. Since the mixture contains a total of 12 + 12 = 24 alkyl protons, a 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\nLet's test the viable pairs:\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Durene gives: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene gives: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined result: **Four** signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Prehnitene gives: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene gives: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined result: Up to **five** signals. This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Durene gives: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   Prehnitene gives: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined Result (Alkyl)**: The mixture contains exactly **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Combined Result (Aromatic)**: Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. The mixture shows two distinct singlets, and since both represent 2 protons, the integration ratio is 2H:2H or **1:1**. This also matches perfectly.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** is the only combination that precisely accounts for all features of the observed ¹H NMR spectrum (two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on a synthesis of the provided reasoning.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Experimental 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's consolidate the key information provided about the 1:1 molar mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidates match this.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds that have aromatic protons in different chemical environments.\n    *   Since it is a 1:1 mixture and the signal integrals are in a 1:1 ratio, the number of protons giving rise to each of the two signals must be identical.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   The most critical point is that all signals are **singlets**. This means there is no spin-spin splitting observed for any of the alkyl protons.\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio represents the relative number of protons contributing to the three distinct alkyl signals in the total mixture. Since there are 12 alkyl protons per molecule, the total in the 1:1 mixture is 24 protons. A 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) for 24 protons means the actual integration is **12H : 6H : 6H**.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nThe next step is to accurately predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each individual compound based on its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound contains two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The protons on the adjacent CH₂ and CH₃ carbons will couple, resulting in spin-spin splitting. The spectrum would show a **quartet** and a **triplet** in the alkyl region, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be definitively **ruled out**. Any option containing it, such as option **D**, is incorrect.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** The four methyl groups are all equivalent due to the molecule's high symmetry. They will produce **one alkyl singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. In a symmetric system, they appear as a **single aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent. This results in **two alkyl singlets (each 6H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to symmetry, resulting in **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This produces **three alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, which corresponds to a 2:1:1 ratio for this compound alone.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that matches the experimental data: **two 1:1 aromatic singlets** and **three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets** (integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H).\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene provides one 2H singlet. Prehnitene provides one 2H singlet. The 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets**, and since both represent 2 protons, their integration ratio is **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene provides **one singlet (12H)**. Prehnitene provides **two singlets (6H each)**. The combined mixture will show exactly **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (one 6H and two 3H singlets). This mixture would have at least four signals (three 6H and two 3H, potentially with overlap). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (one 6H and two 3H singlets). This mixture would have four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals without assuming an unlikely accidental overlap.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that directly and unambiguously accounts for all the features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination produces the correct number of signals and integration ratios in both the aromatic and alkyl regions without requiring any assumptions of coincidental signal overlap.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a synthesis of the provided solutions.\n\n### 1. Initial Analysis of the NMR Data\nThe problem provides key spectral information for a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nA critical point noted by all agents is that **all signals are singlets**. This has immediate implications for the candidate structures.\n\n### 2. Elimination of Unsuitable Candidates\nAll agents correctly identify that **1,4-diethylbenzene** can be immediately ruled out.\n*   **Careful Point:** The ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) in this molecule would produce characteristic splitting patterns (a quartet and a triplet) in the alkyl region due to proton-proton coupling.\n*   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the data that all alkyl signals are singlets. Any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene is incorrect. This eliminates **Option D**.\n\n### 3. Predicting the Spectra of the Remaining Compounds\nThe next step is to accurately predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for the three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (representing 2H).\n        *   Alkyl: One singlet (representing all 12H from the four equivalent methyl groups).\n    *   **Consensus:** All agents agree on this prediction.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry making the protons at C5/C6 equivalent, and the methyl groups at C1/C4 and C2/C3 equivalent in pairs.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (representing 2H).\n        *   Alkyl: Two singlets (each representing 6H).\n    *   **Consensus:** All agents agree on this prediction.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This compound has a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5. This makes the aromatic protons at C4/C6 equivalent and the methyl groups at C1/C3 equivalent.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (representing 2H).\n        *   Alkyl: Three singlets (one 6H for the C1/C3 pair, one 3H for C2, and one 3H for C5, giving a 2:1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Careful Point:** Several agents incorrectly state that this molecule is asymmetric and would produce two 1H aromatic singlets. This is a common error. However, the final correct answer is determined by the alkyl signals, which makes this error non-fatal to the final outcome.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Candidate Mixtures\nThe deciding factor is which 1:1 mixture produces the observed pattern of three alkyl singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. Since the mixture is 1:1 and contains a total of 24 alkyl protons (12 from each isomer), a 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (one 6H singlet, two 3H singlets).\n    *   **Result:** The combination would have up to five signals, which does not match the observed three.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (one 6H singlet, two 3H singlets).\n    *   **Result:** The combination would have four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which does not match the observed three.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene contributes **one singlet of 12H**. Prehnitene contributes **two singlets of 6H each**.\n    *   **Result:** The combined spectrum has exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aromatic check:** Durene gives one 2H singlet and Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture gives the required two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, correctly produces the observed ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination explains the two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and, most decisively, the three alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information**\n\nFirst, let's establish a clear set of requirements from the provided 1H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄ isomers. All four candidates fit this.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum shows two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Implication:** A 1:1 molar mixture giving two signals in a 1:1 ratio means each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and those signals arise from an equal number of protons (likely 2 protons each, as all candidates have at least 2 aromatic protons).\n*   **Alkyl Region:** The spectrum shows three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Key Constraint:** The signals are all singlets. This rules out any structure that would exhibit spin-spin coupling in the alkyl region, like an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Integration:** In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound A) + 12 (from compound B) = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons corresponds to three signals with absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nThe core of the problem is accurately predicting the spectrum for each isomer based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has two ethyl groups. As established above, this would produce a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **immediately ruled out**. Any option containing it, such as option B in the prompt (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene), is incorrect.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C-3 and C-6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one alkyl singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C-5 and C-6) are chemically equivalent. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as **one aromatic singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C-1/C-4 and the pair at C-2/C-3. This results in **two alkyl singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C-2 and C-5.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at C-4 and C-6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C-1/C-3 (6H), the unique one at C-2 (3H), and the unique one at C-5 (3H). This results in **three alkyl singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H integration, which simplifies to a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture fits the spectral data (two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H signals).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene provides one 2H singlet. Prehnitene provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this correctly produces **two aromatic singlets** with a **1:1 ratio** (2H:2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene provides **one 12H singlet**. Prehnitene provides **two 6H singlets**. The combination results in exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pair is a perfect match for all the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Conclusion:** Ruled out because of 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (one 6H, two 3H singlets). The mixture would have at least three 6H signals and two 3H signals. It would not contain the required 12H signal.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Does not match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (one 6H, two 3H singlets). This mixture would show four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Does not match the three observed signals.\n\nThe only pair that precisely accounts for all the features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of the provided ¹H NMR spectral data and a comparison with the predicted spectra for the candidate compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nThe key information about the 1:1 molar mixture is:\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidates match this.\n2.  **Aromatic Region:** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds, each contributing a distinct aromatic signal.\n    *   Because the molar ratio of the compounds and the signal integration ratio are both 1:1, the number of protons giving rise to each aromatic signal must be the same.\n3.  **Alkyl Region:** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The fact that all alkyl signals are **singlets** is a crucial constraint. It indicates the absence of adjacent, non-equivalent protons, which would cause signal splitting (e.g., quartets, triplets).\n    *   The total number of alkyl protons in the mixture (from two tetramethylbenzene molecules) is 12 + 12 = 24.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons corresponds to signals integrating to **12H, 6H, and 6H** respectively (2x + 1x + 1x = 24 → 4x = 24 → x = 6).\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Spectra for the Individual Compounds**\n\nWe must predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule has two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The protons within an ethyl group show coupling, leading to a **quartet** and a **triplet** in the alkyl region. This contradicts the \"all singlets\" data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be definitively **eliminated**. This rules out **Option A**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** The four methyl groups are equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3), producing **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups (C1/C3, C2, C5), producing **three singlets (one 6H and two 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nNow, we must find which pair of the remaining three compounds (all tetramethylbenzenes) gives the required signals for the mixture. The deciding factor is the alkyl region, as the aromatic data (two 2H singlets) would be produced by a mixture of any two of these isomers. We are looking for a combination that produces three alkyl singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   The combination gives too many signals. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Durene contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   The combination would have four signals. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) contributes **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) contributes **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   The combined spectrum for a 1:1 mixture gives exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly explains all features of the observed ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the 1H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, let's understand what the provided experimental data tells us about the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both components are C10H14 isomers. All candidate molecules fit this criterion.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds with different aromatic proton environments.\n    *   Since it's a 1:1 mixture and the signals also have a 1:1 ratio, the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity means the aromatic protons in question have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity rules out any groups that would show complex spin-spin splitting, such as ethyl groups.\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio describes the relative number of protons contributing to each of the three distinct alkyl signals in the mixture. Given a 1:1 molar mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) for 24 protons corresponds to integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n### **2. Prediction of the Individual Spectra of the Candidate Compounds**\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to correctly predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule contains two ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). Protons on adjacent carbons in an ethyl group split each other, producing a characteristic quartet and a triplet. This contradicts the experimental data that all alkyl signals are singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** 1,4-diethylbenzene can be definitively ruled out. This eliminates **Option D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and isolated from other protons. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's high symmetry. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. In these simplified systems, adjacent equivalent protons appear as a single signal. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent to each other, and the pair at C2/C3 are equivalent to each other. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule also possesses a plane of symmetry (passing through carbons 2 and 5).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent and isolated, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **2:1:1 (6H:3H:3H)**.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds (the three tetramethylbenzene isomers) produces the observed spectrum. The deciding factor is the combination of the alkyl signals. We need a combination that gives **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,4-: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined: This mixture would produce at least four signals (or three if the 6H signals accidentally overlap, giving one 12H signal and two 3H signals, for a ratio of 4:1:1). This does not match the 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,4,5-: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined: This mixture would produce four distinct signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,4,5-: **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,4-: **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Combined:** The mixture will show exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   **Ratio:** 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for the alkyl region data.\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Both compounds give one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this correctly produces two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces a spectrum matching all the data is the mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information**\n\nFirst, let's establish the key features of the 1H NMR spectrum provided for the 1:1 molar mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidates fit this.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**. This indicates two different types of aromatic protons are present in the mixture. Because it is a 1:1 mixture and the signals have a 1:1 ratio, the number of protons giving rise to each signal must be the same.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** There are **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**. The \"singlet\" multiplicity is a crucial clue, as it rules out any alkyl groups that would be split by adjacent protons (like ethyl groups).\n\n### **2. Analyze Each Candidate Compound's Predicted Spectrum**\n\nTo determine the correct mixture, we must first predict the individual spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The protons on the adjacent CH₂ and CH₃ carbons will couple, resulting in spin-spin splitting. This would produce a **quartet** and a **triplet** in the alkyl region, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be definitively **ruled out**. Option **C**, which contains 1,4-diethylbenzene, is incorrect.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C-3 and C-6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C-5 and C-6) are chemically equivalent. Because equivalent protons do not split each other, they will appear as **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C-1/C-4 are equivalent, and the pair at C-2/C-3 are also equivalent but different from the first pair. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C-2 and C-5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C-4 and C-6) are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C-1/C-3 are equivalent (6H), the single methyl at C-2 is unique (3H), and the single methyl at C-5 is unique (3H). This produces **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives:\n*   Two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n*   Three alkyl singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's test the remaining options based on our predictions for the pure compounds.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Check:** Each of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) produces **one 2H aromatic singlet**. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of these compounds will produce the required two singlets with a 1:1 ratio. The deciding factor must be the alkyl region.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region Check:** We need a combination of alkyl signals that results in exactly **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 ratio**. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 24 (12 from each compound). A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons corresponds to signals with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:** Durene contributes one 12H singlet. Isodurene contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). This combination would have four signals. **Incorrect.**\n    *   **B) 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:** Prehnitene contributes two 6H singlets. Isodurene contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). This would give a complex mixture of signals including 3H peaks. **Incorrect.**\n    *   **D) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n        *   Combined, the mixture has exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed 1:1, perfectly reproduces the experimental NMR data is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination gives two 1:1 aromatic singlets and, critically, three alkyl singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by synthesizing the provided reasoning from the agents and performing a rigorous check.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's establish the key requirements from the experimental data for the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄ for both components.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum shows **two signals**, both of which are **singlets**, and they have an equal integration ratio of **1:1**.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** The spectrum shows **three signals**, all of which are **singlets**, with a relative integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n\nThe most crucial constraints are:\n1.  All alkyl signals are singlets, ruling out any structures with proton-proton splitting in their alkyl chains (like ethyl groups).\n2.  The final mixture must produce exactly the number of signals and integration ratios specified.\n\n### **2. Prediction of 1H NMR Spectra for Individual Compounds**\n\nThe next step is to analyze each candidate compound's structure and symmetry to predict its individual NMR spectrum. This is a common point of focus in the provided answers.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). As correctly identified by a majority of the agents, the protons within an ethyl group split each other, producing a characteristic quartet and a triplet. This contradicts the \"all singlets\" constraint.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **1,4-diethylbenzene is not present in the mixture.** This immediately eliminates option **D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are equivalent due to symmetry. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets with a 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1) ratio**.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test the remaining combinations (A, B, C) to see which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n**Aromatic Region Requirement:** Two singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\nA 1:1 mixture of any two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers will fulfill this requirement, as each one contributes a single 2H singlet, leading to two distinct 2H signals in the mixture (a 1:1 ratio). Therefore, the alkyl region is the deciding factor.\n\n**Alkyl Region Requirement:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio.\nIn a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from the first compound) + 12 (from the second compound) = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24 protons means the signals must have absolute integrations of **12H**, **6H**, and **6H**. We must find the pair whose individual signals combine to produce this result.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined result: Up to 5 signals. Even with accidental overlap of the 6H signals, the combination would be one 12H signal and two 3H signals. This does not match the required 12H, 6H, 6H integration.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Durene contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined result: Four distinct signals. This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   Durene contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Combined result: The mixture gives exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for the alkyl region data. As established earlier, it also matches the aromatic region data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the exact NMR spectrum described is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination provides a direct and unambiguous explanation for all the spectral features.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct mixture of compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information**\n\nFirst, let's carefully interpret the data from the ¹H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 molar mixture:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   \"Two signals\" implies we are observing protons from two different chemical environments, which makes sense for a mixture of two compounds.\n    *   Since it is a 1:1 mixture and the signals have a 1:1 ratio, the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second.\n    *   \"Singlets\" indicates that the protons giving rise to these signals are not adjacent to any non-equivalent protons.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   \"All singlets\" is a critical constraint. It means we have alkyl groups (likely methyls) that are not subject to splitting from adjacent protons. This immediately brings ethyl groups, which produce quartets and triplets, into question.\n    *   The \"2:1:1 ratio\" describes the relative population of protons in the three distinct alkyl environments. In a 1:1 mixture of C₁₀H₁₄ isomers, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio (total of 4 parts) means the absolute integrations are (2/4)*24 = **12H**, (1/4)*24 = **6H**, and (1/4)*24 = **6H**.\n\n### **2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to predict the spectrum for each individual compound to understand how it would contribute to the mixture. The key factor is molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has two ethyl groups. An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) shows splitting: a **quartet** for the -CH₂- and a **triplet** for the -CH₃-. This contradicts the \"all singlets\" data.\n    *   **Conclusion: 1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated.** This immediately rules out **Option D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Very high, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).*\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).*\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry passes through the C2 and C5 atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (equivalent, 6H), the one at C2 (unique, 3H), and the one at C5 (unique, 3H). This produces **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)** in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).*\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Target Spectrum:**\n    *   Aromatic: Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Alkyl: Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio (integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H).\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl Signals: Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: This mixture would produce four alkyl singlets (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl Signals: Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: This mixture would produce at least four signals (or more if none overlap). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture gives **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene gives **one 12H singlet**. Prehnitene gives **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Combined: This mixture produces exactly **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only combination that precisely matches all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This pair produces the correct number of signals and integration ratios in both the aromatic and alkyl regions without needing to assume any coincidental signal overlaps.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a systematic analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information**\n\nFirst, let's understand the requirements imposed by the 1H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, this means the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second signal.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** There are three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity is a crucial clue. It indicates there are no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to cause splitting.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture of C10H14 isomers, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24.\n    *   A 2:1:1 integration ratio for 24 total protons means the three signals must correspond to absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. (Let the ratio be 2x:1x:1x. Then 2x + x + x = 24 -> 4x = 24 -> x = 6).\n\n### **2. Analyze Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nNext, we predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). Protons within an ethyl group split each other, producing a characteristic **quartet** and **triplet** in the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This directly contradicts the experimental data, which states all alkyl signals are **singlets**. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene can be definitively **ruled out**. This eliminates option **A**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and isolated. They will produce **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one alkyl singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the two protons at positions 5 and 6 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** These two equivalent protons appear as a **single aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two alkyl singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of chemically distinct methyl groups: C1/C3 are equivalent (6H), C2 is unique (3H), and C5 is unique (3H). This produces **three alkyl singlets** with a **2:1:1 ratio (6H:3H:3H)** by itself.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining candidates matches the experimental data. The alkyl region is the most informative. We need to obtain three signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out.\n*   **Option B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. Isodurene gives one 6H and two 3H singlets. This combination would result in at least four signals (or fewer if there is accidental overlap), which does not directly match the three required signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives one 6H and two 3H singlets. This combination would result in four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which does not match the observed three signals.\n*   **Option D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB (Durene) provides **one singlet of 12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB (Prehnitene) provides **two singlets of 6H each**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture produces exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Both Durene and Prehnitene produce one 2H aromatic singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this will result in two distinct 2H singlets, which corresponds to the observed 1:1 ratio. This also matches.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture directly and perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided ¹H NMR data and a comparison with the predicted spectra for each potential compound and mixture.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data\nThe spectrum of the 1:1 molar mixture gives us the following key information:\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidates match this.\n2.  **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds, each with a distinct aromatic proton environment compared to the other.\n    *   Because the molar ratio and the signal integration ratio are both 1:1, the number of protons contributing to each of the two aromatic singlets must be equal.\n3.  **Alkyl Region:** There are three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity is a critical clue. It means there is no spin-spin coupling for these alkyl protons. This is typical for methyl groups on a benzene ring but rules out other groups like ethyl, which would show splitting (quartets/triplets).\n    *   The total number of alkyl protons in a 1:1 mixture of two tetramethylbenzene isomers is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio (total of 4 parts) of 24 protons corresponds to signals integrating to **12H** (2/4 of 24), **6H** (1/4 of 24), and **6H** (1/4 of 24). This specific integration pattern is what we must find in the combined spectrum.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the Spectra of the Individual Compounds\n\nWe must predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each candidate molecule based on its symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The protons on the -CH₂- and -CH₃ groups are adjacent and would split each other, producing a quartet and a triplet. Since the problem states all alkyl signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene is immediately ruled out**. This eliminates option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons (at C3, C6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons (at C5, C6) are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons (at C4, C6) are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (equivalent by symmetry), the one at C2 (unique), and the one at C5 (unique). This produces **three singlets** with integrations of **6H, 3H, and 3H**, respectively (a 2:1:1 ratio for the pure compound).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture produces the required spectrum. The deciding factor is the alkyl region, which must have three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined Alkyl Spectrum:** This combination produces exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum Check:** Both compounds give one 2H singlet. A mixture gives two 2H singlets, which is a 1:1 ratio. This also matches perfectly.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl combination: Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. Isodurene gives one 6H and two 3H singlets. This would result in up to five signals, with no 12H signal. This does not match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl combination: Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives one 6H and two 3H singlets. This mixture would have four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only combination that precisely matches all features of the experimental ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer by synthesizing the reasoning from the provided agent answers and conducting a rigorous check.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectral Information\n\nFirst, we must establish a clear set of requirements from the provided ¹H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula**: Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄ isomers. All four candidates fit this description.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**:\n    *   **Three signals**: The mixture contains three distinct chemical environments for alkyl protons.\n    *   **All signals are singlets**: This is a critical constraint. It means that none of the alkyl protons are subject to spin-spin splitting from adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately rules out structures with coupled protons, such as ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Integration ratio of 2:1:1**: Since it is a 1:1 mixture of isomers each containing 12 alkyl protons (4 x CH₃), the total number of alkyl protons in the sample is 24. A 2:1:1 ratio represents a total of 4 parts (2+1+1). Therefore, the absolute number of protons for each signal is:\n        *   (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    The mixture's alkyl spectrum must contain three singlets with integrations corresponding to 12 protons, 6 protons, and 6 protons.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**:\n    *   **Two signals**: The two compounds in the mixture have different chemical environments for their aromatic protons.\n    *   **Both signals are singlets**: The aromatic protons in each compound are \"isolated\" and not split by neighbors.\n    *   **Integration ratio of 1:1**: As the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, this means that the number of protons contributing to each of the two aromatic signals is identical.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound\n\nWe must predict the spectrum of each individual compound to understand its contribution to the mixture.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule contains two ethyl groups. Due to proton-proton coupling, these groups would produce a characteristic **quartet** and a **triplet** in the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This directly contradicts the experimental data stating that all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be definitively eliminated**. This immediately rules out **Option C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: High (two perpendicular planes of symmetry).\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This produces **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Mixtures\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that matches the required spectrum: two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets (corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H). The alkyl region is the most decisive.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl Signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Alkyl Signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: **Four** total signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl Signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Alkyl Signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: At least four signals (or more), and does not produce the 12H:6H:6H pattern. This does not match.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Check**: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this creates **two distinct singlets**, each representing 2 protons, which matches the **1:1 ratio** requirement.\n    *   **Alkyl Check**:\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides: **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides: **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Combined Result**: The mixture has exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches all experimental data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis overwhelmingly confirms that the only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, precisely accounts for all the features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination explains the two 1:1 aromatic singlets and, critically, the three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, let's establish a clear understanding of the information provided by the spectrum for the 1:1 molar mixture:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows **two signals**, both are **singlets**, and they have a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   This indicates the mixture contains two compounds with different aromatic proton environments.\n    *   Because the mixture is 1:1 and the signals have a 1:1 integration ratio, the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity is a critical clue, meaning the aromatic protons in question are not adjacent to any non-equivalent protons (i.e., they are isolated).\n\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows **three signals**, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   The fact that all alkyl signals are \"singlets\" is a major constraint. It means none of the alkyl protons are subject to spin-spin splitting from adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This is characteristic of methyl groups on a substituted benzene ring but rules out groups like ethyl (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio describes the relative number of protons contributing to the three distinct alkyl environments found in the mixture. Since there are 14 protons per molecule, the total number of protons is 28. Twelve of these are methyl protons, so the total in the alkyl region is 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to signals with relative integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **2. Analyze Each Candidate Compound Individually**\n\nThe next step is to predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound contains two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). Due to spin-spin coupling, the -CH₂- protons would appear as a **quartet** and the -CH₃ protons would appear as a **triplet**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This directly contradicts the experimental data stating that all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately ruled out**, which eliminates option D.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and isolated. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to the high symmetry. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent (but different from the first pair). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule is asymmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments and are isolated. They would produce **two distinct singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all in unique environments, which would be expected to produce four singlets (each 3H), or fewer due to accidental overlap.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which of the remaining 1:1 mixtures produces the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. This mixture would show a total of **three** aromatic signals. This **does not match** the observed two signals.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. This mixture would also show a total of **three** aromatic signals. This **does not match** the observed data.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n        *   A 1:1 mixture results in **two aromatic singlets**. Since each signal comes from 2 protons and the molar ratio is 1:1, their integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet of 12H.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides two singlets of 6H each.\n        *   The combined mixture will show a total of **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n        *   The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, precisely accounts for all the features of the observed ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination explains the two 1:1 aromatic singlets and the three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlaps.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a detailed, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nFirst, let's break down what the provided experimental data tells us about the 1:1 molar mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both components are isomers with the formula C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidate molecules fit this description.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   There are **three** distinct signals.\n    *   The multiplicity of all three signals is **singlet**. This is a crucial clue. The presence of only singlets indicates that the protons giving rise to these signals are not coupled to any non-equivalent adjacent protons. This immediately brings ethyl groups into question, as an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) would produce a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin splitting.\n    *   The integration ratio is **2:1:1**. Since this is a 1:1 mixture of C₁₀H₁₄ isomers, the total number of methyl protons is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio represents 4 parts (2+1+1). Therefore, the actual number of protons for each signal is (2/4)*24H = **12H**, (1/4)*24H = **6H**, and (1/4)*24H = **6H**.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   There are **two** distinct signals.\n    *   Both are **singlets**.\n    *   The integration ratio is **1:1**. In a 1:1 molar mixture, this means the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe will now analyze each candidate based on its molecular structure and symmetry to predict its individual NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule contains two ethyl groups. As established in Step 1, these groups would produce a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region. This contradicts the experimental data.\n    *   **Conclusion: 1,4-diethylbenzene can be definitively ruled out.** This eliminates option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. Equivalent protons do not split each other, resulting in **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent due to reflection across the plane. This results in **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (equivalent by reflection), the unique methyl at C2 (on the plane), and the unique methyl at C5 (on the plane). This results in **three singlets** with integrations of **6H, 3H, and 3H**, respectively (a 2:1:1 ratio for the pure compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in the remaining options (A, B, D) to see which one matches the experimental data.\n\n**Required Mixture Spectrum:**\n*   Aromatic: Two 1:1 singlets. (Since all three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce a 2H singlet, any 1:1 mixture of two of them will satisfy this).\n*   Alkyl: Three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's test the combinations:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from Durene: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Alkyl signals from Isodurene: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined spectrum: This mixture would produce **four** signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from Durene: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   Alkyl signals from Prehnitene: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Combined spectrum: The mixture gives a total of **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from Prehnitene: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Alkyl signals from Isodurene: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined spectrum: This would have up to five signals, or if the 6H signals overlap, it would be one 18H signal and two 3H signals (a ratio of 6:1:1). This does not match.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described ¹H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination directly accounts for both the aromatic and alkyl region signals without needing to assume any coincidental signal overlaps.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information**\n\nFirst, let's establish a clear set of requirements from the provided ¹H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula**: Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄.\n*   **Aromatic Region**: The spectrum shows **two signals**, both are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**. This means the mixture contains two compounds, each with a different aromatic proton environment. Since the mixture and signal ratio are both 1:1, the number of protons giving rise to each singlet must be the same.\n*   **Alkyl Region**: The spectrum shows **three signals**, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**. The \"singlet\" multiplicity is critical. The 2:1:1 ratio describes the relative number of protons in the three distinct alkyl environments found in the mixture. Since a 1:1 mixture of C₁₀H₁₄ isomers contains 24 alkyl protons (12 from each compound), a 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) means the signals must correspond to integrations of **12H**, **6H**, and **6H**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nNext, we must predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on their molecular structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The protons on the adjacent carbons will couple via spin-spin splitting, producing a characteristic **quartet** (for the CH₂) and **triplet** (for the CH₃) in the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This directly contradicts the experimental data, which states all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This immediately rules out **Option D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Signal**: The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals**: All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Signal**: The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are equivalent. In these simplified systems, adjacent equivalent protons appear as a single signal. This gives **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals**: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic Signal**: The protons at C4 and C6 are reflected by this plane, making them equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the single methyl at C2 (3H), and the single methyl at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H ratio, which is **2:1:1**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) satisfies the spectral requirements. The decision will primarily rest on the alkyl signals, as they are more distinctive.\n\n*   **Requirement:** Three alkyl singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Prehnitene provides: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene provides: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: This would produce at least four signals (up to three 6H signals and two 3H signals). This does not match the requirement of three signals with a 12H:6H:6H integration.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Durene provides: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene provides: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: This would produce four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the requirement of three signals with a 12H:6H:6H integration.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this creates two distinct signals, each integrating to 2H. This matches the **two singlets, 1:1 ratio** requirement.\n    *   **Alkyl Check:**\n        *   Durene provides **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   Prehnitene provides **two singlets (6H each)**.\n        *   Combined Result: The mixture has exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the requirement.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only option that directly and perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a systematic, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectral Data**\n\nWe must first translate the provided 1H NMR data into structural requirements for the two compounds in the 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula**: C10H14. All four candidate molecules fit this.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**: The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity is a crucial clue. It indicates that the protons giving rise to these signals are not split by adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately calls into question any compound containing an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), which would show a characteristic quartet and triplet.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**: The spectrum shows **two singlets** with a **1:1** integration ratio.\n    *   This implies the two compounds in the mixture have distinct aromatic proton environments.\n    *   Because the molar ratio of the compounds is 1:1 and the signal integration is 1:1, the number of protons contributing to each of the two aromatic singlets must be identical.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nNow, we will predict the spectrum of each individual compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n    *   This compound contains two ethyl groups. As explained in Step 1, the ethyl groups will produce a **quartet** and a **triplet** in the alkyl region due to proton-proton coupling.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This contradicts the data stating all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene is not present in the mixture. This definitively rules out **Option B**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent proton neighbors. This produces **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons**: All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. This produces **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are equivalent due to symmetry. Although adjacent, in a symmetric system, they appear as a **single singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons**: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**:\n    *   Regardless of its exact spectrum, a mixture containing this compound will not match the observed data (as shown in Step 3). For example, some analyses predict two 1H aromatic singlets. If this compound were present, it would lead to a total of three aromatic signals in a mixture with either Durene or Prehnitene, which contradicts the \"two signals\" observation.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives:\n1.  **Aromatic Spectrum**: Two singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n2.  **Alkyl Spectrum**: Three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. The total alkyl protons in a 1:1 mixture is 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24H means the signals must integrate to **12H**, **6H**, and **6H**.\n\nLet's test the remaining valid options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**: As noted above, this mixture would result in three aromatic signals, which does not match the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**: This mixture would also result in three aromatic signals, which does not match the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**:\n    *   **Aromatic Signals**: Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Prehnitene contributes another distinct 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture yields exactly **two singlets**. Since each arises from 2 protons, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals**: Durene contributes **one singlet of 12H**. Prehnitene contributes **two singlets of 6H each**. The combined mixture gives exactly **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** is the only one that directly and completely accounts for all features of the observed 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a systematic, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct mixture of compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Information from the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nFirst, we must fully understand the clues provided by the spectral data for the 1:1 molar mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula**: Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**: There are two signals.\n    *   **Multiplicity**: Both are singlets. This indicates the aromatic protons are not coupled to adjacent, non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **Integration Ratio**: 1:1. Since it's a 1:1 mixture of isomers, this means the number of protons giving rise to each signal is identical.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**: There are three signals.\n    *   **Multiplicity**: All are singlets. This is a crucial constraint. It rules out any alkyl groups that would show coupling, such as the ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) which produces a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Integration Ratio**: 2:1:1. This represents the relative number of protons in the three distinct alkyl environments found in the total mixture.\n\n### **2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Candidate**\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to accurately predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each potential compound based on its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n    *   This compound contains two ethyl groups. An ethyl group gives a **quartet** and a **triplet** in the alkyl region due to proton-proton coupling.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This contradicts the data stating all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene is **eliminated** as a possibility. Option B can be discarded.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. Equivalent adjacent protons in such a system appear as a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (the pair at C1/C4) and (the pair at C2/C3). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons (at C4 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which is **2:1:1**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe now compare the combined spectra of the pairs in the options against the experimental data. The deciding factor will be the alkyl region signals.\n\n*   **Data Requirement (Alkyl Region)**: Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. Since the mixture contains a total of 12 + 12 = 24 alkyl protons, a 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\nLet's test the viable pairs:\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Durene gives: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene gives: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined result: **Four** signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Prehnitene gives: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene gives: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined result: Up to **five** signals. This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Durene gives: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   Prehnitene gives: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined Result (Alkyl)**: The mixture contains exactly **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Combined Result (Aromatic)**: Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. The mixture shows two distinct singlets, and since both represent 2 protons, the integration ratio is 2H:2H or **1:1**. This also matches perfectly.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** is the only combination that precisely accounts for all features of the observed ¹H NMR spectrum (two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on a synthesis of the provided reasoning.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Experimental 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's consolidate the key information provided about the 1:1 molar mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidates match this.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds that have aromatic protons in different chemical environments.\n    *   Since it is a 1:1 mixture and the signal integrals are in a 1:1 ratio, the number of protons giving rise to each of the two signals must be identical.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   The most critical point is that all signals are **singlets**. This means there is no spin-spin splitting observed for any of the alkyl protons.\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio represents the relative number of protons contributing to the three distinct alkyl signals in the total mixture. Since there are 12 alkyl protons per molecule, the total in the 1:1 mixture is 24 protons. A 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) for 24 protons means the actual integration is **12H : 6H : 6H**.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nThe next step is to accurately predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each individual compound based on its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound contains two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The protons on the adjacent CH₂ and CH₃ carbons will couple, resulting in spin-spin splitting. The spectrum would show a **quartet** and a **triplet** in the alkyl region, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be definitively **ruled out**. Any option containing it, such as option **D**, is incorrect.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** The four methyl groups are all equivalent due to the molecule's high symmetry. They will produce **one alkyl singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. In a symmetric system, they appear as a **single aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent. This results in **two alkyl singlets (each 6H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to symmetry, resulting in **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This produces **three alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, which corresponds to a 2:1:1 ratio for this compound alone.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that matches the experimental data: **two 1:1 aromatic singlets** and **three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets** (integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H).\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene provides one 2H singlet. Prehnitene provides one 2H singlet. The 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets**, and since both represent 2 protons, their integration ratio is **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene provides **one singlet (12H)**. Prehnitene provides **two singlets (6H each)**. The combined mixture will show exactly **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (one 6H and two 3H singlets). This mixture would have at least four signals (three 6H and two 3H, potentially with overlap). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (one 6H and two 3H singlets). This mixture would have four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals without assuming an unlikely accidental overlap.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that directly and unambiguously accounts for all the features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination produces the correct number of signals and integration ratios in both the aromatic and alkyl regions without requiring any assumptions of coincidental signal overlap.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a synthesis of the provided solutions.\n\n### 1. Initial Analysis of the NMR Data\nThe problem provides key spectral information for a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nA critical point noted by all agents is that **all signals are singlets**. This has immediate implications for the candidate structures.\n\n### 2. Elimination of Unsuitable Candidates\nAll agents correctly identify that **1,4-diethylbenzene** can be immediately ruled out.\n*   **Careful Point:** The ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) in this molecule would produce characteristic splitting patterns (a quartet and a triplet) in the alkyl region due to proton-proton coupling.\n*   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the data that all alkyl signals are singlets. Any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene is incorrect. This eliminates **Option D**.\n\n### 3. Predicting the Spectra of the Remaining Compounds\nThe next step is to accurately predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for the three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (representing 2H).\n        *   Alkyl: One singlet (representing all 12H from the four equivalent methyl groups).\n    *   **Consensus:** All agents agree on this prediction.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry making the protons at C5/C6 equivalent, and the methyl groups at C1/C4 and C2/C3 equivalent in pairs.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (representing 2H).\n        *   Alkyl: Two singlets (each representing 6H).\n    *   **Consensus:** All agents agree on this prediction.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This compound has a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5. This makes the aromatic protons at C4/C6 equivalent and the methyl groups at C1/C3 equivalent.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (representing 2H).\n        *   Alkyl: Three singlets (one 6H for the C1/C3 pair, one 3H for C2, and one 3H for C5, giving a 2:1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Careful Point:** Several agents incorrectly state that this molecule is asymmetric and would produce two 1H aromatic singlets. This is a common error. However, the final correct answer is determined by the alkyl signals, which makes this error non-fatal to the final outcome.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Candidate Mixtures\nThe deciding factor is which 1:1 mixture produces the observed pattern of three alkyl singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. Since the mixture is 1:1 and contains a total of 24 alkyl protons (12 from each isomer), a 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (one 6H singlet, two 3H singlets).\n    *   **Result:** The combination would have up to five signals, which does not match the observed three.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (one 6H singlet, two 3H singlets).\n    *   **Result:** The combination would have four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which does not match the observed three.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene contributes **one singlet of 12H**. Prehnitene contributes **two singlets of 6H each**.\n    *   **Result:** The combined spectrum has exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aromatic check:** Durene gives one 2H singlet and Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture gives the required two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, correctly produces the observed ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination explains the two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and, most decisively, the three alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information**\n\nFirst, let's establish a clear set of requirements from the provided 1H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄ isomers. All four candidates fit this.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum shows two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Implication:** A 1:1 molar mixture giving two signals in a 1:1 ratio means each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and those signals arise from an equal number of protons (likely 2 protons each, as all candidates have at least 2 aromatic protons).\n*   **Alkyl Region:** The spectrum shows three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Key Constraint:** The signals are all singlets. This rules out any structure that would exhibit spin-spin coupling in the alkyl region, like an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Integration:** In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound A) + 12 (from compound B) = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons corresponds to three signals with absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nThe core of the problem is accurately predicting the spectrum for each isomer based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has two ethyl groups. As established above, this would produce a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **immediately ruled out**. Any option containing it, such as option B in the prompt (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene), is incorrect.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C-3 and C-6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one alkyl singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C-5 and C-6) are chemically equivalent. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as **one aromatic singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C-1/C-4 and the pair at C-2/C-3. This results in **two alkyl singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C-2 and C-5.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at C-4 and C-6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C-1/C-3 (6H), the unique one at C-2 (3H), and the unique one at C-5 (3H). This results in **three alkyl singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H integration, which simplifies to a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture fits the spectral data (two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H signals).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene provides one 2H singlet. Prehnitene provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this correctly produces **two aromatic singlets** with a **1:1 ratio** (2H:2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene provides **one 12H singlet**. Prehnitene provides **two 6H singlets**. The combination results in exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pair is a perfect match for all the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Conclusion:** Ruled out because of 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (one 6H, two 3H singlets). The mixture would have at least three 6H signals and two 3H signals. It would not contain the required 12H signal.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Does not match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (one 6H, two 3H singlets). This mixture would show four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Does not match the three observed signals.\n\nThe only pair that precisely accounts for all the features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of the provided ¹H NMR spectral data and a comparison with the predicted spectra for the candidate compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nThe key information about the 1:1 molar mixture is:\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidates match this.\n2.  **Aromatic Region:** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds, each contributing a distinct aromatic signal.\n    *   Because the molar ratio of the compounds and the signal integration ratio are both 1:1, the number of protons giving rise to each aromatic signal must be the same.\n3.  **Alkyl Region:** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The fact that all alkyl signals are **singlets** is a crucial constraint. It indicates the absence of adjacent, non-equivalent protons, which would cause signal splitting (e.g., quartets, triplets).\n    *   The total number of alkyl protons in the mixture (from two tetramethylbenzene molecules) is 12 + 12 = 24.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons corresponds to signals integrating to **12H, 6H, and 6H** respectively (2x + 1x + 1x = 24 → 4x = 24 → x = 6).\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Spectra for the Individual Compounds**\n\nWe must predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule has two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The protons within an ethyl group show coupling, leading to a **quartet** and a **triplet** in the alkyl region. This contradicts the \"all singlets\" data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be definitively **eliminated**. This rules out **Option A**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** The four methyl groups are equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3), producing **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups (C1/C3, C2, C5), producing **three singlets (one 6H and two 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nNow, we must find which pair of the remaining three compounds (all tetramethylbenzenes) gives the required signals for the mixture. The deciding factor is the alkyl region, as the aromatic data (two 2H singlets) would be produced by a mixture of any two of these isomers. We are looking for a combination that produces three alkyl singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   The combination gives too many signals. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Durene contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   The combination would have four signals. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) contributes **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) contributes **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   The combined spectrum for a 1:1 mixture gives exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly explains all features of the observed ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the 1H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, let's understand what the provided experimental data tells us about the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both components are C10H14 isomers. All candidate molecules fit this criterion.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds with different aromatic proton environments.\n    *   Since it's a 1:1 mixture and the signals also have a 1:1 ratio, the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity means the aromatic protons in question have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity rules out any groups that would show complex spin-spin splitting, such as ethyl groups.\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio describes the relative number of protons contributing to each of the three distinct alkyl signals in the mixture. Given a 1:1 molar mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) for 24 protons corresponds to integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n### **2. Prediction of the Individual Spectra of the Candidate Compounds**\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to correctly predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule contains two ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). Protons on adjacent carbons in an ethyl group split each other, producing a characteristic quartet and a triplet. This contradicts the experimental data that all alkyl signals are singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** 1,4-diethylbenzene can be definitively ruled out. This eliminates **Option D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and isolated from other protons. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's high symmetry. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. In these simplified systems, adjacent equivalent protons appear as a single signal. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent to each other, and the pair at C2/C3 are equivalent to each other. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule also possesses a plane of symmetry (passing through carbons 2 and 5).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent and isolated, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **2:1:1 (6H:3H:3H)**.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds (the three tetramethylbenzene isomers) produces the observed spectrum. The deciding factor is the combination of the alkyl signals. We need a combination that gives **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,4-: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined: This mixture would produce at least four signals (or three if the 6H signals accidentally overlap, giving one 12H signal and two 3H signals, for a ratio of 4:1:1). This does not match the 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,4,5-: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined: This mixture would produce four distinct signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,4,5-: **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,4-: **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Combined:** The mixture will show exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   **Ratio:** 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for the alkyl region data.\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Both compounds give one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this correctly produces two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces a spectrum matching all the data is the mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information**\n\nFirst, let's establish the key features of the 1H NMR spectrum provided for the 1:1 molar mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidates fit this.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**. This indicates two different types of aromatic protons are present in the mixture. Because it is a 1:1 mixture and the signals have a 1:1 ratio, the number of protons giving rise to each signal must be the same.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** There are **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**. The \"singlet\" multiplicity is a crucial clue, as it rules out any alkyl groups that would be split by adjacent protons (like ethyl groups).\n\n### **2. Analyze Each Candidate Compound's Predicted Spectrum**\n\nTo determine the correct mixture, we must first predict the individual spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The protons on the adjacent CH₂ and CH₃ carbons will couple, resulting in spin-spin splitting. This would produce a **quartet** and a **triplet** in the alkyl region, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be definitively **ruled out**. Option **C**, which contains 1,4-diethylbenzene, is incorrect.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C-3 and C-6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C-5 and C-6) are chemically equivalent. Because equivalent protons do not split each other, they will appear as **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C-1/C-4 are equivalent, and the pair at C-2/C-3 are also equivalent but different from the first pair. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C-2 and C-5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C-4 and C-6) are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C-1/C-3 are equivalent (6H), the single methyl at C-2 is unique (3H), and the single methyl at C-5 is unique (3H). This produces **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives:\n*   Two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n*   Three alkyl singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's test the remaining options based on our predictions for the pure compounds.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Check:** Each of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) produces **one 2H aromatic singlet**. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of these compounds will produce the required two singlets with a 1:1 ratio. The deciding factor must be the alkyl region.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region Check:** We need a combination of alkyl signals that results in exactly **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 ratio**. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 24 (12 from each compound). A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons corresponds to signals with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:** Durene contributes one 12H singlet. Isodurene contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). This combination would have four signals. **Incorrect.**\n    *   **B) 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:** Prehnitene contributes two 6H singlets. Isodurene contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). This would give a complex mixture of signals including 3H peaks. **Incorrect.**\n    *   **D) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n        *   Combined, the mixture has exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed 1:1, perfectly reproduces the experimental NMR data is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination gives two 1:1 aromatic singlets and, critically, three alkyl singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by synthesizing the provided reasoning from the agents and performing a rigorous check.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's establish the key requirements from the experimental data for the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄ for both components.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum shows **two signals**, both of which are **singlets**, and they have an equal integration ratio of **1:1**.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** The spectrum shows **three signals**, all of which are **singlets**, with a relative integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n\nThe most crucial constraints are:\n1.  All alkyl signals are singlets, ruling out any structures with proton-proton splitting in their alkyl chains (like ethyl groups).\n2.  The final mixture must produce exactly the number of signals and integration ratios specified.\n\n### **2. Prediction of 1H NMR Spectra for Individual Compounds**\n\nThe next step is to analyze each candidate compound's structure and symmetry to predict its individual NMR spectrum. This is a common point of focus in the provided answers.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). As correctly identified by a majority of the agents, the protons within an ethyl group split each other, producing a characteristic quartet and a triplet. This contradicts the \"all singlets\" constraint.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **1,4-diethylbenzene is not present in the mixture.** This immediately eliminates option **D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are equivalent due to symmetry. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets with a 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1) ratio**.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test the remaining combinations (A, B, C) to see which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n**Aromatic Region Requirement:** Two singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\nA 1:1 mixture of any two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers will fulfill this requirement, as each one contributes a single 2H singlet, leading to two distinct 2H signals in the mixture (a 1:1 ratio). Therefore, the alkyl region is the deciding factor.\n\n**Alkyl Region Requirement:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio.\nIn a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from the first compound) + 12 (from the second compound) = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24 protons means the signals must have absolute integrations of **12H**, **6H**, and **6H**. We must find the pair whose individual signals combine to produce this result.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined result: Up to 5 signals. Even with accidental overlap of the 6H signals, the combination would be one 12H signal and two 3H signals. This does not match the required 12H, 6H, 6H integration.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Durene contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined result: Four distinct signals. This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   Durene contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Combined result: The mixture gives exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for the alkyl region data. As established earlier, it also matches the aromatic region data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the exact NMR spectrum described is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination provides a direct and unambiguous explanation for all the spectral features.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct mixture of compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information**\n\nFirst, let's carefully interpret the data from the ¹H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 molar mixture:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   \"Two signals\" implies we are observing protons from two different chemical environments, which makes sense for a mixture of two compounds.\n    *   Since it is a 1:1 mixture and the signals have a 1:1 ratio, the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second.\n    *   \"Singlets\" indicates that the protons giving rise to these signals are not adjacent to any non-equivalent protons.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   \"All singlets\" is a critical constraint. It means we have alkyl groups (likely methyls) that are not subject to splitting from adjacent protons. This immediately brings ethyl groups, which produce quartets and triplets, into question.\n    *   The \"2:1:1 ratio\" describes the relative population of protons in the three distinct alkyl environments. In a 1:1 mixture of C₁₀H₁₄ isomers, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio (total of 4 parts) means the absolute integrations are (2/4)*24 = **12H**, (1/4)*24 = **6H**, and (1/4)*24 = **6H**.\n\n### **2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to predict the spectrum for each individual compound to understand how it would contribute to the mixture. The key factor is molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has two ethyl groups. An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) shows splitting: a **quartet** for the -CH₂- and a **triplet** for the -CH₃-. This contradicts the \"all singlets\" data.\n    *   **Conclusion: 1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated.** This immediately rules out **Option D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Very high, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).*\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).*\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry passes through the C2 and C5 atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (equivalent, 6H), the one at C2 (unique, 3H), and the one at C5 (unique, 3H). This produces **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)** in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).*\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Target Spectrum:**\n    *   Aromatic: Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Alkyl: Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio (integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H).\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl Signals: Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: This mixture would produce four alkyl singlets (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl Signals: Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: This mixture would produce at least four signals (or more if none overlap). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture gives **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene gives **one 12H singlet**. Prehnitene gives **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Combined: This mixture produces exactly **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only combination that precisely matches all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This pair produces the correct number of signals and integration ratios in both the aromatic and alkyl regions without needing to assume any coincidental signal overlaps.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a systematic analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information**\n\nFirst, let's understand the requirements imposed by the 1H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, this means the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second signal.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** There are three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity is a crucial clue. It indicates there are no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to cause splitting.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture of C10H14 isomers, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24.\n    *   A 2:1:1 integration ratio for 24 total protons means the three signals must correspond to absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. (Let the ratio be 2x:1x:1x. Then 2x + x + x = 24 -> 4x = 24 -> x = 6).\n\n### **2. Analyze Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nNext, we predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). Protons within an ethyl group split each other, producing a characteristic **quartet** and **triplet** in the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This directly contradicts the experimental data, which states all alkyl signals are **singlets**. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene can be definitively **ruled out**. This eliminates option **A**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and isolated. They will produce **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one alkyl singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the two protons at positions 5 and 6 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** These two equivalent protons appear as a **single aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two alkyl singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of chemically distinct methyl groups: C1/C3 are equivalent (6H), C2 is unique (3H), and C5 is unique (3H). This produces **three alkyl singlets** with a **2:1:1 ratio (6H:3H:3H)** by itself.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining candidates matches the experimental data. The alkyl region is the most informative. We need to obtain three signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out.\n*   **Option B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. Isodurene gives one 6H and two 3H singlets. This combination would result in at least four signals (or fewer if there is accidental overlap), which does not directly match the three required signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives one 6H and two 3H singlets. This combination would result in four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which does not match the observed three signals.\n*   **Option D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB (Durene) provides **one singlet of 12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB (Prehnitene) provides **two singlets of 6H each**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture produces exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Both Durene and Prehnitene produce one 2H aromatic singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this will result in two distinct 2H singlets, which corresponds to the observed 1:1 ratio. This also matches.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture directly and perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided ¹H NMR data and a comparison with the predicted spectra for each potential compound and mixture.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data\nThe spectrum of the 1:1 molar mixture gives us the following key information:\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidates match this.\n2.  **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds, each with a distinct aromatic proton environment compared to the other.\n    *   Because the molar ratio and the signal integration ratio are both 1:1, the number of protons contributing to each of the two aromatic singlets must be equal.\n3.  **Alkyl Region:** There are three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity is a critical clue. It means there is no spin-spin coupling for these alkyl protons. This is typical for methyl groups on a benzene ring but rules out other groups like ethyl, which would show splitting (quartets/triplets).\n    *   The total number of alkyl protons in a 1:1 mixture of two tetramethylbenzene isomers is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio (total of 4 parts) of 24 protons corresponds to signals integrating to **12H** (2/4 of 24), **6H** (1/4 of 24), and **6H** (1/4 of 24). This specific integration pattern is what we must find in the combined spectrum.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the Spectra of the Individual Compounds\n\nWe must predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each candidate molecule based on its symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The protons on the -CH₂- and -CH₃ groups are adjacent and would split each other, producing a quartet and a triplet. Since the problem states all alkyl signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene is immediately ruled out**. This eliminates option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons (at C3, C6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons (at C5, C6) are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons (at C4, C6) are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (equivalent by symmetry), the one at C2 (unique), and the one at C5 (unique). This produces **three singlets** with integrations of **6H, 3H, and 3H**, respectively (a 2:1:1 ratio for the pure compound).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture produces the required spectrum. The deciding factor is the alkyl region, which must have three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined Alkyl Spectrum:** This combination produces exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum Check:** Both compounds give one 2H singlet. A mixture gives two 2H singlets, which is a 1:1 ratio. This also matches perfectly.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl combination: Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. Isodurene gives one 6H and two 3H singlets. This would result in up to five signals, with no 12H signal. This does not match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl combination: Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives one 6H and two 3H singlets. This mixture would have four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only combination that precisely matches all features of the experimental ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
