    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and its Relation to Wavelength Shift:**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star wobbles as it orbits the common center of mass with the planet. This wobble causes its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away.\n    The magnitude of the wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity, $v_r$, according to the Doppler effect formula: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$.\n    The \"periodic shift of up to 5 miliangstrom\" refers to the amplitude of this shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$. This corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, known as the RV semi-amplitude, $K$.\n    Therefore, we can establish a direct proportionality: $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n    From the problem statement:\n    -   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ milliangstroms\n    -   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ milliangstroms\n    So, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n2.  **Relate RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:**\n    For a planet of mass $m_p$ orbiting a star of mass $M_{star}$ in a circular orbit with period $T$ and inclination $i$, the RV semi-amplitude $K$ is given by the formula:\n    $K = \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{(M_{star} + m_p)^{2/3}} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    where G is the gravitational constant.\n    Since planets are much less massive than stars ($m_p \\ll M_{star}$), we can use the approximation $M_{star} + m_p \\approx M_{star}$. The formula becomes:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n3.  **Apply the Conditions from the Problem:**\n    We need to compare the two exoplanetary systems. Let's see which parameters are constant between the two systems.\n    -   \"two stars with exactly the same masses\": $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    -   \"both with masses similar to that of Neptune\": In the context of RV measurements, the quantity that is directly measured is the minimum mass, $m_p \\sin i$. It is reasonable to assume this observable quantity is the same for both planets. Thus, $(m_p \\sin i)_1 = (m_p \\sin i)_2$.\n    -   $G$ and $2\\pi$ are physical constants.\n\n    With $M_{star}$ and $m_p \\sin i$ being constant for both systems, the relationship between $K$ and $T$ simplifies to:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}$ or $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    From the proportionality $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$, we can write the relationship for the two systems as:\n    $K \\cdot T^{1/3} = \\text{constant}$\n    Therefore:\n    $K_1 T_1^{1/3} = K_2 T_2^{1/3}$\n    We want to find the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{T_2^{1/3}}{T_1^{1/3}} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n    $\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n    To solve for the ratio of the periods, we cube both sides:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n5.  **Substitute the Values and Find the Answer:**\n    We already found that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$, which means $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n    Substituting this into our equation for the period ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n    Now, let's compute the numerical value.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio (5/7)^3\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.36443148688046646\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.364.

    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Relationship between Wavelength Shift and Radial Velocity**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method works by detecting the Doppler shift in a star's light. The amount of wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity, $v_r$, along our line of sight. The maximum observed wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is known as the RV semi-amplitude, denoted by $K$.\n    Therefore, we have the relationship:\n    $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of the RV Semi-Amplitudes**\n    We are given the maximum periodic shifts for the two planets:\n    *   Planet #1: $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ milliangstroms\n    *   Planet #2: $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ milliangstroms\n    Using the proportionality from step 1, we can find the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n3.  **Relate RV Semi-Amplitude to Orbital Period**\n    The formula for the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $K = \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    where:\n    *   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n    *   $T$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $i$ is the orbital inclination (the angle of the orbit relative to our line of sight).\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Formula Based on the Problem's Conditions**\n    The problem states that several parameters are the same for both systems:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$.\n    *   In RV measurements, the quantity we actually constrain is the minimum mass, $m_p \\sin i$. It is standard to assume that this is the parameter being compared, meaning $(m_p \\sin i)_1 = (m_p \\sin i)_2$.\n    *   $2\\pi$ and $G$ are constants.\n\n    Since $m_p \\sin i$ and $M_{star}$ are the same for both systems, the formula simplifies to a proportionality between $K$ and $T$:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}$ or $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**\n    From the proportionality $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$, we can set up a ratio for our two systems:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. To do this, we can raise both sides of the equation to the power of 3:\n    $\\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n\n    Now, we can invert the equation to solve for our desired ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n6.  **Substitute the Values and Compute the Final Answer**\n    From step 2, we know that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$, which means $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n    Substituting this into our equation:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n    Let's calculate the numerical value.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the periods\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.36443148688046646\n</execute_result>\nThe result is approximately 0.36.
