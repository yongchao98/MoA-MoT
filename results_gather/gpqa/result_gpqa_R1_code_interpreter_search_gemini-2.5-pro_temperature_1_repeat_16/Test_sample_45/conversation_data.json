    "*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants and the reaction.**\n    The reactant is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. \"Racemic\" means it is a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's denote them as A_R and A_S.\n    The reagent is Grubbs catalyst, which catalyzes olefin metathesis.\n    The reaction is a self-metathesis of a terminal alkene, which follows the general scheme:\n    2 R-CH=CH₂  ⇌  R-CH=CH-R + CH₂=CH₂ (ethene)\n    The question asks for the number of products excluding ethene.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the structure of the product.**\n    For 3-methylpent-1-ene, the R group is a sec-butyl group with a chiral center: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n    The product R-CH=CH-R is 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:\n    CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃.\n    This product molecule has two chiral centers (at C3 and C6) and a central double bond (at C4) which can have E or Z geometry.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the possible reaction pairings.**\n    Since the starting material is a racemic mixture of A_R and A_S, three types of metathesis reactions can occur:\n    1.  Homodimerization: A_R + A_R → Product_RR\n    2.  Homodimerization: A_S + A_S → Product_SS\n    3.  Cross-dimerization: A_R + A_S → Product_RS\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the stereochemistry of the products from each pairing.**\n    The metathesis reaction does not affect the existing stereocenters but creates a new double bond, which can be either E or Z. We need to analyze the stereoisomers formed in each case. The product is 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n\n    1.  **A_R + A_R:** This reaction combines two (R)-sec-butyl groups. The product is (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. This reaction will produce a mixture of two diastereomers based on the double bond geometry:\n        *   (E)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n        *   (Z)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n        These are **2** distinct products.\n\n    2.  **A_S + A_S:** This reaction combines two (S)-sec-butyl groups. The product is (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Similar to the above, this produces two diastereomers:\n        *   (E)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral, enantiomer of the E,R,R isomer)\n        *   (Z)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral, enantiomer of the Z,R,R isomer)\n        These are another **2** distinct products. Enantiomers are different chemical compounds and are counted separately.\n\n    3.  **A_R + A_S:** This cross-reaction combines one (R)-sec-butyl group and one (S)-sec-butyl group. The product is (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. We must analyze the stereochemistry of the E and Z isomers of this constitution.\n        *   **(E)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** In this molecule, the two stereocenters (C3 and C6) are constitutionally equivalent. The configuration is (R, S). The E-geometry places the two groups on opposite sides of the double bond. This molecule possesses a center of inversion (S₂ symmetry element) at the midpoint of the C=C bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. Therefore, this is a **meso** compound. It is a single product.\n        *   **(Z)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** In this molecule, the two enantiomeric groups (R and S) are on the same side (cis) of the double bond. Similar to cis-1,2-disubstituted cycloalkanes, this molecule is achiral because it can adopt conformations that have a plane of symmetry (a plane bisecting the C=C bond). Even if its lowest energy conformation is chiral (with C₂ symmetry), the rapid interconversion through an achiral conformation makes the molecule as a whole achiral. Therefore, this is also a **meso** compound. It is a single product.\n        So, the cross-reaction produces **2** distinct diastereomeric meso-products.\n\n*   **Step 5: Tally the total number of products.**\n    Summing the products from all three possible reaction pairings:\n    *   From R+R: 2 products (E/Z diastereomers of the R,R-enantiomer)\n    *   From S+S: 2 products (E/Z diastereomers of the S,S-enantiomer)\n    *   From R+S: 2 products (E/Z diastereomers, both of which are meso compounds)\n\n    Total number of possible products = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nThese 6 products are all the possible stereoisomers of 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene that can be formed from the starting material. They are:\n1.  (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n2.  (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n3.  (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n4.  (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n5.  (E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n6.  (Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n\n<<<D>>>"
