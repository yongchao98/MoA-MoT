    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Identify the fundamental principles\nThe potentials V and $\\vec{A}$ for a time-varying charge and current distribution are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the retarded time. This is the time at which the signal must be emitted from the source point $\\vec{r}'$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n\n### 2. Model the moving point charge\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using Dirac delta functions:\n*   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n### 3. Substitute the densities into the potential integrals\nSubstituting the charge density into the formula for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nThe retarded time $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$ ($t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$), which makes the integral non-trivial.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the integrals\nThe evaluation of this integral is a standard procedure in advanced electromagnetism. A common method involves re-writing the integral with a delta function in time to handle the retardation properly. The result of this integration is:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')| \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}(t') \\cdot (\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t'))}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\right)} \\right]_{t'=t_r}$\n\nLet's use the notation given in the problem statement:\n*   The retarded time is $t_r$.\n*   The velocity at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n*   The vector from the retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   The magnitude of this vector is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n\nWith this notation, the scalar potential becomes:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd} \\right)} = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nTo match the format of the answers, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by c:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nA similar calculation for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ yields:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}(t')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')| \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}(t') \\cdot (\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t'))}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\right)} \\right]_{t'=t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by c:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 5. Compare with the given options\nLet's examine the choices:\n*   A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$: This is incorrect. The potential $V$ is given for a static charge (Coulomb's law), not a generally moving one.\n*   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$: The sign in the denominator is positive, which contradicts our derived result. The sign is negative.\n*   C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$: These expressions match our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials exactly.\n*   D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$: The expression for V is for a static charge, and the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is dimensionally incorrect (it's a scalar, not a vector).\n\nTherefore, option C provides the correct formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nIt's also useful to note the relationship between V and $\\vec{A}$ for a moving point charge:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi \\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\nThis relationship holds for the expressions in option C (using $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$).\n\n<<<C>>>"
