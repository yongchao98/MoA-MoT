    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Compound Type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring with two substituents, and four hydrogens on the ring itself. The core of the molecule is C6H4.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** Shows an absorption peak for an ester group (-COO-). This means the molecule contains two oxygen atoms, a carbonyl group (C=O), and an ether-like linkage.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Six signals:** This indicates there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** For a di-substituted benzene ring, having two signals for the four aromatic protons is characteristic of a para (1,4) substitution pattern, especially with electronically different substituents.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a very informative splitting pattern. A vinyl group has protons on a C=C double bond.\n        *   A proton that is a **doublet of quartets** is split by two different neighbors: one proton (giving the doublet) and a set of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). The set of three protons is a methyl (-CH3) group.\n        *   A proton that is a **doublet** is split by one neighboring proton.\n        *   This pattern perfectly describes a propenyl group: **-CH=CH-CH3**. Let's call the protons Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3. H(b) is split by H(a) and the -CH3 group, making it a doublet of quartets. H(a) is split only by H(b), making it a doublet. This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n    *   **Two -CH3 group signals:** The molecule has two methyl groups that are in different chemical environments. We have already identified one in the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH3**). The second one must be part of the ester group.\n    *   **No -CH2- group signals:** This is a crucial constraint. The structure cannot contain any methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can identify the following pieces of the molecule:\n\n*   **Fragment 1:** A di-substituted benzene ring (**C6H4**).\n*   **Fragment 2:** A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3), which has the formula **C3H5**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl-H signals and one of the -CH3 signals. It contains no -CH2- groups.\n*   **Fragment 3:** An ester group that contains the second -CH3 group and has no -CH2- groups. The two simplest possibilities are:\n    *   A methyl ester group: -COOCH3.\n    *   An acetoxy group: -O-CO-CH3.\n    Both of these fragments have the same atomic composition: **C2H3O2**.\n\n**3. Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from all the fragments to find the total molecular formula:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2) = **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **From the structure:**\n    *   Benzene ring = 4 (1 for the ring + 3 for the double bonds)\n    *   Ester C=O group = 1\n    *   Vinyl C=C group = 1\n    *   **Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\n*   **From the derived formula (C11H12O2):**\n    *   DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    *   DBE = 11 - 12/2 + 0/2 + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = **6**\n\nThe DBE calculated from the structure matches the DBE calculated from the formula C11H12O2, confirming our result.\n\n**5. Evaluate Other Options**\n\n*   **A) C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 - 14/2 + 1 = 5. This does not match the required DBE of 6.\n*   **C) C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 - 12/2 + 1 = 7. This does not match the required DBE of 6.\n*   **D) C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 - 14/2 + 1 = 6. This DBE matches, but to get this formula from our structure (C11H12O2), we would need to add a 'CH2' unit. The problem explicitly states there are no -CH2- groups, ruling out this option.\n\nConclusion: The only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
