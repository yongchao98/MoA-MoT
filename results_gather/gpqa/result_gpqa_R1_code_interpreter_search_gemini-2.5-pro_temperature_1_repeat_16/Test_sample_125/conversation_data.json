    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure. The IUPAC name indicates a 6-carbon chain (hexane), a ketone at position 3, and a methoxy group (-OCH3) at position 5.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃\n    *   The molecule has one chiral center at carbon C5. The configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagents:** 1. LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride), 2. Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The carbonyl group (C=O) at C3 will be reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product(s):** 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₃\n*   **Stereochemistry of Reaction I:**\n    *   The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center. The original chiral center at C5 remains unchanged (its configuration is still S).\n    *   The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, creating either an (R) or (S) configuration at the new chiral center (C3).\n    *   Since the starting material is a single enantiomer ((S) at C5), the two products will have configurations (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S).\n    *   Molecules that have the same connectivity but differ in the configuration at some, but not all, of their chiral centers are called **diastereomers**.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction I produces a mixture of **two diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃\n    *   This molecule is achiral as it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), 2. Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. Since it is used in excess, both ketone groups at C2 and C4 will be reduced.\n*   **Product(s):** Pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃\n*   **Stereochemistry of Reaction II:**\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's examine the products:\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. This pair is formed as a racemic mixture (1:1 ratio).\n        *   The (2R, 4S) configuration has an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the CH₂ group, making it superimposable on its mirror image. Such a compound is called a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces a mixture of **three stereoisomers**: one pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe combined mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = 5 unique stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nNow, let's determine how many peaks will be observed in each type of HPLC.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Separation)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   It can separate **constitutional isomers** and **diastereomers** because they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate **enantiomers** because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Let's analyze the mixture:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I ((3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will not be separated and will elute together as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated, giving another **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are different molecules (different chemical formulas and structures). They will have different retention times.\n    *   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + (1 + 1) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Separation)**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows it to distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   It can separate **enantiomers**, **diastereomers**, and **constitutional isomers**. Essentially, it can separate all unique stereoisomers.\n*   Let's analyze the 5 unique compounds in the mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak**\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak** (separated from its diastereomer)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak** (separated from its enantiomer)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak** (this is an achiral, single compound)\n*   Since all five compounds are stereochemically distinct (either diastereomers, enantiomers, or constitutional isomers of each other), a chiral HPLC column will resolve all of them.\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **5 peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
