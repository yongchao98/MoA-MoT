    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze the concept of density.** Density is defined as mass divided by volume (ρ = M/V). For a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius.\n\n2.  **Evaluate option (a): An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\n    *   This option serves as our baseline reference.\n    *   The density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's denote this as ρ_Earth.\n    *   So, for planet (a), the density is ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n3.  **Evaluate option (b): A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.**\n    *   The density is explicitly stated in the question.\n    *   The density is ρ_b ≈ 5.5 g/cm³. This is nearly identical to Earth's density.\n\n4.  **Evaluate option (c): A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\n    *   This planet is a \"super-Earth\". It has the same building blocks as Earth (e.g., iron, silicates) but significantly more mass.\n    *   A fundamental principle in planetary science is gravitational self-compression. The immense gravity of a more massive planet compresses its constituent materials, forcing the atoms closer together.\n    *   This compression means that for a given amount of material, it will occupy less volume than it would under lower pressure.\n    *   Because the mass (M) is much larger and the volume (V) does not increase proportionally (in fact, it increases more slowly than the mass), the overall density (ρ = M/V) will be significantly *higher* than Earth's density.\n    *   Therefore, ρ_c > ρ_Earth ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n5.  **Evaluate option (d): A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\n    *   This is the opposite scenario to option (c). This planet is a \"sub-Earth\".\n    *   With less mass, there is less gravitational force and therefore less self-compression.\n    *   The materials are \"fluffier\" or less compressed than they are inside Earth.\n    *   This means its overall density will be *lower* than Earth's density. A real-world example is Mars, which has about 11% of Earth's mass and a density of only 3.93 g/cm³, despite having a broadly similar silicate and iron composition.\n    *   Therefore, ρ_d < ρ_Earth ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n6.  **Compare the densities.**\n    *   ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   ρ_b ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   ρ_c > 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   ρ_d < 5.51 g/cm³\n\n7.  **Conclusion.** By comparing the calculated relative densities, the planet in option (c) is the only one with a density definitively greater than Earth's. The other planets have densities either similar to or less than Earth's. Therefore, the planet with 5 times the mass of Earth will have the highest density due to gravitational compression.\n\n<<<D>>>"
