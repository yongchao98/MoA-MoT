    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 2 and level 1) changes. Specifically, it asks for the ratio `(N2/N1)_unspotted` divided by `(N2/N1)_spotted`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physical Law:** The problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). In LTE, the population of different energy levels of an atom is described by the **Boltzmann equation**:\n    `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `N_j` and `N_i` are the number of atoms in energy levels `j` and `i`.\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   `E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratios:**\n    Let `Ratio_unspotted` be the population ratio when the star has no spots, and `T_unspotted = 6000 K`.\n    `Ratio_unspotted = (N2/N1)_unspotted = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1) / (k * T_unspotted))`\n\n    Let `Ratio_spotted` be the population ratio when the star has spots, and the overall effective temperature is `T_spotted = 5500 K`.\n    `Ratio_spotted = (N2/N1)_spotted = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1) / (k * T_spotted))`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Factor:** We need to find the factor `F = Ratio_unspotted / Ratio_spotted`.\n    `F = [ (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1) / (k * T_unspotted)) ] / [ (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1) / (k * T_spotted)) ]`\n\n    The statistical weights `(g2/g1)` cancel out. Using the exponent rule `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`, we get:\n    `F = exp( [-(E2 - E1) / (k * T_unspotted)] - [-(E2 - E1) / (k * T_spotted)] )`\n    `F = exp( (E2 - E1) / k * [1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted] )`\n    or equivalently\n    `F = exp( -(E2 - E1) / k * [1/T_unspotted - 1/T_spotted] )`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (E2 - E1):** The energy difference `ΔE = E2 - E1` corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`. The formula is:\n    `ΔE = h * c / λ`\n    where `h` is the Planck constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n6.  **Combine the Formulas:** Substitute the expression for `ΔE` into the equation for the factor `F`:\n    `F = exp( -(h * c / λ) / k * [1/T_unspotted - 1/T_spotted] )`\n\n7.  **Identify Unnecessary Information:** The star's radius (1.5 solar radii), mass (1.1 solar masses), and the spot coverage percentage (40%) are extra details. The key information is the two effective temperatures (6000 K and 5500 K) and the transition wavelength (1448 Å).\n\n8.  **Perform the Calculation:** Now, we can plug in the values and constants to find the numerical answer. A Python script is efficient for this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the physical constants in SI units\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant (J·s)\nc = 299792458       # Speed of light (m/s)\nk = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant (J/K)\n\n# Define the given parameters\nlambda_angstrom = 1448  # Wavelength in Angstroms\nlambda_m = lambda_angstrom * 1e-10  # Convert wavelength to meters\n\nT_unspotted = 6000  # Effective temperature of the unspotted star (K)\nT_spotted = 5500    # Effective temperature of the spotted star (K)\n\n# Calculate the energy difference (Delta E = E2 - E1)\ndelta_E = h * c / lambda_m\n\n# The ratio we want to find is:\n# Factor = Ratio_unspotted / Ratio_spotted\n# Factor = exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T_unspotted)) / exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T_spotted))\n# Factor = exp( -(E2-E1)/k * (1/T_unspotted - 1/T_spotted) )\n\n# Calculate the term in the exponent\nexponent = (-delta_E / k) * (1/T_unspotted - 1/T_spotted)\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(factor)\n```\n<execute_code>\n4.506555139265911\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that the factor is approximately 4.507. This value is very close to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The reasoning behind the solution is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Principle:** The problem asks for the ratio of populations in two different energy levels of an atom under different temperature conditions. Since the problem states the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms across energy levels is described by the **Boltzmann equation**:\n\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\n    where:\n    *   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the upper (level 2) and lower (level 1) energy states, respectively.\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels (E₂ - E₁).\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Define the Ratios for Both Scenarios:**\n    *   **Unspotted Star:** Temperature T_unspotted = 6000 K.\n        The ratio is `R_unspotted = (N₂/N₁)_unspotted = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted))`\n\n    *   **Spotted Star:** Temperature T_spotted = 5500 K.\n        The ratio is `R_spotted = (N₂/N₁)_spotted = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spotted))`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Factor:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes, which is `R_unspotted / R_spotted`.\n\n    Factor = `[(g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted))] / [(g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spotted))]`\n\n    The statistical weights `(g₂/g₁)` cancel out. Using the property of exponents `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`, we get:\n\n    Factor = `exp[(-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spotted))]`\n    Factor = `exp[(-ΔE/k) * (1/T_unspotted - 1/T_spotted)]`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy of a photon corresponding to a transition is related to its wavelength (λ) by the formula:\n\n    ΔE = h * c / λ\n\n    where:\n    *   h is the Planck constant.\n    *   c is the speed of light.\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 * 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n\n5.  **Substitute and Compute:** We plug the expression for ΔE into the factor equation and use the given values. The Python code executed this calculation:\n    *   `T_unspotted` = 6000 K\n    *   `T_spotted` = 5500 K\n    *   `λ` = 1448 * 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   `h` ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   `c` ≈ 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   `k` ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n\n    The code performed the calculation:\n    `factor = exp( (-(h*c/λ)/k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) )`\n\n6.  **Interpret the Result:** The code output was `4.506...`. Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) ~7.8\n    B) ~2.9\n    C) ~1.1\n    D) ~4.5\n\nThe calculated value of ~4.51 is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
