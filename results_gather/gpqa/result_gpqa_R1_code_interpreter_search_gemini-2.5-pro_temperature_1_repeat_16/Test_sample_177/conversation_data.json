    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Determine the mass dimensions of the fields and operators.**\n\nIn natural units, where $\\hbar=c=1$, the action $S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}$ is a dimensionless quantity. The mass dimension of the spacetime volume element $d^4x$ is $[d^4x]_M = -4$. Consequently, for the action to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of $+4$.\n$[\\mathcal{L}]_M = 4$.\n\nThe interaction Lagrangian is a term within the total Lagrangian, so it must also have a mass dimension of 4.\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$.\n\nNow, let's find the mass dimension of each component in the interaction term:\n\n*   **Fermion field $\\psi$**: The kinetic term for a fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{fermion} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$. We know $[\\mathcal{L}_{fermion}]_M = 4$. The derivative operator $\\partial_\\mu$ has a mass dimension of $[\\partial_\\mu]_M = 1$. The mass term $m\\bar{\\psi}\\psi$ tells us that $[m]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\psi]_M = 4$, which is $1 + 2[\\psi]_M = 4$, so $[\\psi]_M=3/2$. Let's check with the kinetic term: $[\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi]_M = [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [\\partial_\\mu]_M = 3/2 + 3/2 + 1 = 4$. This is consistent.\n    So, $[\\psi]_M = [\\bar{\\psi}]_M = 3/2$.\n\n*   **Field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{EM} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. We know $[\\mathcal{L}_{EM}]_M = 4$. This means $[F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$.\n    So, $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2$.\n\n*   **Sigma matrix $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$**: This is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}]$. The gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless matrices that define the Clifford algebra. Therefore, their commutator, $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$, is also dimensionless.\n    So, $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 0$.\n\n**2. Calculate the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$.**\n\nWe can now use the mass dimensions of the components to find the mass dimension of $\\kappa$.\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + \\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \\frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + 3 + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + 5 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M = -1$.\n\nThe mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n**3. Determine the renormalizability of the theory.**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory is determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants. The rule of thumb in 4-dimensional spacetime is as follows:\n*   If a coupling constant $g$ has a positive mass dimension, $[g]_M > 0$, the interaction is **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant $g$ is dimensionless, $[g]_M = 0$, the interaction is **renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant $g$ has a negative mass dimension, $[g]_M < 0$, the interaction is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant $\\kappa$ has a mass dimension of $[\\kappa]_M = -1$. A negative mass dimension implies that the theory is **not renormalizable** by power-counting. Such terms can arise in effective field theories, but if included as a fundamental interaction in the Lagrangian, they lead to divergences in loop calculations that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counter-terms.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
