    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Operators:**\n    The problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$:\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    These are the standard spin-1/2 angular momentum operators, where the matrices are the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$). So, $\\vec{P}$ is the spin operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$.\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector:**\n    The direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. A general unit vector in 3D spherical coordinates is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle (angle with the z-axis) and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle (angle with the x-axis in the x-y plane).\n    Since $\\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero.\n    $\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = 0$\n    This implies $\\phi = 0$ (or $\\phi=\\pi$). We can choose $\\phi=0$ without loss of generality.\n    So, the unit vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator along the Direction $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    Substituting the components of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n    $P_n = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x) (\\sin\\theta) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y) (0) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z) (\\cos\\theta)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n    Now, substitute the matrix forms of $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_z$:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n    $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n    Let the eigenvector be represented by a column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    We can cancel $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Eigenvector Components:**\n    The matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n    (1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    (2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n    Let's solve the first equation for the ratio $b/a$:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n    To simplify this expression, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n    Substituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    So, $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The unnormalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:**\n    The normalization condition is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.\n    $|a|^2 + |a \\tan(\\theta/2)|^2 = 1$\n    $|a|^2 (1 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n    Using the identity $1 + \\tan^2(x) = \\sec^2(x)$:\n    $|a|^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n    $|a|^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2)$\n    Choosing the overall phase such that $a$ is real and positive, we get $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$.\n    Now we find $b$:\n    $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n    Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The calculated elements are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
