    "The user wants to find the concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, in a solution that initially contains a 0.02 M concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Reaction Equilibrium**: The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is an equilibrium reaction. The complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$, will dissociate slightly into its constituent ions, $Ca^{2+}$ and $EDTA^{4-}$. The reaction for this dissociation is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Formation Constant ($K_f$)**: The problem provides the formation constant, $K_{Ca-EDTA}$, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Initial, Change, Equilibrium (ICE) Table**: We can set up an ICE table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    The concentration of free calcium ions at equilibrium is 'x'.\n\n4.  **Equilibrium Expression and Calculation**: We substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Approximation**: Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium lies heavily on the side of the complex. This means that the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the approximation that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n6.  **Solve for x**:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n    Rearranging to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    Now, we solve for x by taking the square root:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n\nTo simplify the calculation, let's use a python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the variables based on the problem\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# The equation is K_f = (initial_complex_conc) / (x**2)\n# So, x**2 = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\n\n# x is the square root of x_squared\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n6.32e-07\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that $x = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, at equilibrium is 'x', which is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The equilibrium reaction for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is:\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\nThe formation constant, $K_f$, is given for the formation reaction:\n$Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n$K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations.
