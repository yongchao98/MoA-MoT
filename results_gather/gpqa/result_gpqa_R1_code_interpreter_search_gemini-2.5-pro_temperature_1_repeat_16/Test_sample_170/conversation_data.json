    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The question describes an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically bromination (using an excess of bromine), on six different monosubstituted benzene derivatives. We need to arrange these substances in order of the *increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer*. Since all isomers (ortho, meta, para) of a given brominated product will have the same molecular weight, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar percentage yield. So, we need to rank the compounds based on the expected percentage of para-bromination.\n\n2.  **Classify the Substituents:** The key to determining the product distribution (regioselectivity) in electrophilic aromatic substitution is the nature of the substituent already on the ring. We can classify them into two main categories:\n    *   **Ortho, Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the positions ortho and para to themselves.\n    *   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n\n    Let's classify each substituent:\n    *   **1) -CH3 (in Toluene):** An alkyl group. It's an *activating* and *ortho, para-director*.\n    *   **2) -COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate):** An ester group. The carbonyl (C=O) is electron-withdrawing. It's a *deactivating* and *meta-director*.\n    *   **3) -Cl (in Chlorobenzene):** A halogen. It's *deactivating* (by induction) but an *ortho, para-director* (by resonance).\n    *   **4) -NO2 (in Nitrobenzene):** A nitro group. It's a very strong electron-withdrawing group, making it strongly *deactivating* and a *meta-director*.\n    *   **5) -C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene):** An alkyl group. It's *activating* and an *ortho, para-director*.\n    *   **6) -COOH (in Benzoic acid):** A carboxylic acid group. The carbonyl (C=O) is electron-withdrawing. It's a *deactivating* and *meta-director*.\n\n3.  **Initial Broad Ranking:** The meta-directors will produce very little of the para-isomer, as the main product is the meta-isomer. The ortho, para-directors will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer. Therefore, the compounds with meta-directing groups will have the lowest para yields and will come first in our ranking.\n\n    *   **Lowest para yields (meta-directors):** Nitrobenzene (4), Benzoic acid (6), Ethyl benzoate (2).\n    *   **Highest para yields (ortho, para-directors):** Toluene (1), Ethylbenzene (5), Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n4.  **Rank the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2):**\n    *   For these groups, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The yield of this minor product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. The more strongly deactivating a group is, the more selectively it directs to the meta position, and the less para-product is formed.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength for these groups is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**.\n    *   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength.\n    *   Order of increasing para yield: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n    *   This gives us the start of our sequence: **4 < 6 < 2 ...**\n\n5.  **Rank the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 3, 5):**\n    *   For these groups, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This ratio is primarily affected by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n    *   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size makes it more difficult for the incoming electrophile (Br+) to attack the adjacent ortho positions. Consequently, a higher proportion of the substitution occurs at the less hindered para position. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n    *   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** Halogens are a special case. Although they are deactivating overall, their ortho, para-directing ability comes from resonance stabilization of the intermediate. The strong negative inductive effect of chlorine deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the more distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with some steric hindrance, results in a very high preference for para substitution, often higher than for simple alkyl groups. Experimental data for bromination confirms this:\n        *   Toluene (1): ~62% para\n        *   Ethylbenzene (5): ~65% para\n        *   Chlorobenzene (3): ~69% para\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n    *   This gives us the end of our sequence: **... 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n6.  **Combine the Rankings:**\n    *   Now, we combine the two ranked lists. The meta-directors have the lowest yields, followed by the ortho, para-directors with the highest yields.\n    *   Start of sequence (meta-directors): **4 < 6 < 2**\n    *   End of sequence (ortho, para-directors): **1 < 5 < 3**\n    *   Combining them gives the final order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n7.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   The derived order is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n    *   This matches option B.\n\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nC) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
