    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe need to identify a pair of compounds from the given options that, when mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio, would produce the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe will analyze the symmetry of each potential compound to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and their relative integrations. All four compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since they have no adjacent protons, it will be a **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal, a **singlet**. Integration: 12H.\n    *   **Summary:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n        *   Alkyl: 1 singlet (12H)\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. It will appear as a **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This results in two distinct methyl signals. Both will be **singlets**. Integration: 6H and 6H.\n    *   **Summary:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n        *   Alkyl: 2 singlets (6H each)\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is less symmetrical. It has one plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce two distinct signals. Both will be **singlets**. Integration: 1H and 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent. The methyl group at C2 is unique, and the methyl group at C5 is unique. This results in three distinct methyl signals. All will be **singlets**. Integration: 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   **Summary:**\n        *   Aromatic: 2 singlets (1H each)\n        *   Alkyl: 3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single **singlet**. Integration: 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 groups will produce a **quartet** (4H), and the CH3 groups will produce a **triplet** (6H).\n    *   **Summary:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (4H)\n        *   Alkyl: 1 quartet (4H), 1 triplet (6H)\n    *   **Note:** This compound can be immediately ruled out because the problem states the alkyl signals are all singlets.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options based on a 1:1 Mixture**\n\nNow, let's combine the predicted spectra for each pair in a 1:1 ratio and see which one matches the experimental data.\n\n**A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Total:** Assuming they have different chemical shifts, we get **two singlets**. Their integration ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This matches the data.\n*   **Alkyl Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H each).\n    *   **Total:** We get **three singlets**. Their integration ratio is 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n*   **Conclusion:** This pair is a perfect match for the described spectrum.\n\n**B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Total:** This would result in three aromatic signals with a 2:1:1 ratio. This contradicts the data, which states there are only two signals.\n*   **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n**C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Total:** This would also result in three aromatic signals with a 2:1:1 ratio. This contradicts the data.\n*   **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n**D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   **Alkyl Signals:** This mixture would contain a quartet and a triplet from 1,4-diethylbenzene. The problem states all alkyl signals are singlets.\n*   **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe only combination that matches the observed NMR data (two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio) is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
