    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The potential energy of the particle is given in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ as:\n    $V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    Solving the Schrödinger equation is often simpler if the potential is separable in the chosen coordinate system. Let's convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ using the standard transformations:\n    $x = r \\cos(\\theta)$\n    $y = r \\sin(\\theta)$\n    $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\n    Substitute these into the potential expression:\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k (r \\cos(\\theta))^2$\n    Since $x = r \\cos(\\theta)$, we have:\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k x^2$\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    Now, combine the terms with $x^2$:\n    $V(x, y) = (\\frac{1}{2} k + \\frac{3}{2} k) x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n    $V(x, y) = (\\frac{4}{2} k) x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n    $V(x, y) = 2 k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n\n4.  **Identify the System:**\n    The potential $V(x, y)$ is the sum of two independent potentials, one depending only on $x$ and the other only on $y$:\n    $V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$\n    where:\n    $V_x(x) = 2 k x^2$\n    $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n    Each of these potentials is in the form of a simple harmonic oscillator, $V(q) = \\frac{1}{2} K_{eff} q^2$, where $K_{eff}$ is the effective spring constant.\n\n5.  **Solve the Schrödinger Equation:**\n    For a separable potential, the total energy $E$ is the sum of the energies of the independent one-dimensional systems: $E = E_x + E_y$. The energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) are given by:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{K_{eff}}{m}}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Energy for the x-oscillator:**\n    For the motion in the x-direction, we have $V_x(x) = 2 k x^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (4k) x^2$.\n    The effective spring constant is $K_x = 4k$.\n    The angular frequency is $\\omega_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{K_x}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4k}{m}} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-oscillator are:\n    $E_{n_x} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega_x = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar (2 \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}})$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Energy for the y-oscillator:**\n    For the motion in the y-direction, we have $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$.\n    The effective spring constant is $K_y = k$.\n    The angular frequency is $\\omega_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{K_y}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-oscillator are:\n    $E_{n_y} = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega_y = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum:**\n    The total energy is the sum $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}$:\n    $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar (2 \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    Let's factor out the common term $\\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$:\n    $E = \\left[ 2(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\right] \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    Distribute the factor of 2:\n    $E = \\left[ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + \\frac{1}{2} \\right] \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    Combine the constant terms:\n    $E = (2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n9.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived energy spectrum is $E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) \\hbar \\sqrt{k/m}$. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
