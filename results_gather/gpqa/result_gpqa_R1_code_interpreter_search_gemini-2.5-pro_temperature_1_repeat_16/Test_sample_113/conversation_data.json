    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone (butan-2-one).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction proceeds via nucleophilic addition.\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n            CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃ + CN⁻ → CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃\n        2.  The negatively charged oxygen atom of the alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin.\n            CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺). This is typically achieved by using a weak acid or by adding a strong acid to the NaCN solution to generate hydrocyanic acid (HCN) *in situ*. The notation H₃O⁺ represents an acidic aqueous solution, which serves as the required proton source.\n    *   **Evaluating Options for A:**\n        *   NaHSO₃: This reagent is used for bisulfite addition reactions, not cyanohydrin formation. So, options A and B are incorrect.\n        *   H₃O⁺: This represents an acid source, which is necessary for the protonation step. This is a suitable choice. So, options C and D are possible.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The conversion of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid is a hydrolysis reaction that requires either a strong acid or a strong base as a catalyst, along with water (and usually heat).\n        R-CN + 2 H₂O + H⁺ (catalyst) → R-COOH + NH₄⁺\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n    *   **Evaluating Options for B (considering A is H₃O⁺ from the first analysis):**\n        *   HCl (from option C): Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and an excellent catalyst for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   CH₃COOH (from option D): Acetic acid is a weak acid. While it might catalyze the reaction to a very small extent, it is not an effective or standard reagent for this transformation. Strong acids like HCl or H₂SO₄ are required for efficient hydrolysis.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, reagent A needs to be a proton source, making H₃O⁺ the correct choice.\n    *   For the second reaction, reagent B needs to be a strong catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis, making HCl the correct choice.\n    *   Combining these findings, the correct pair of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
