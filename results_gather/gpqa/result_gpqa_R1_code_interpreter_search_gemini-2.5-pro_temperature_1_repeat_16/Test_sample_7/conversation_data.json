As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the relationship between the genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n**1. Analyze the Single-Mutant Phenotypes**\n*   **Wild-type (WT):** 100% resistance (our baseline).\n*   **g1 mutant (G1 knocked out):** 75% resistance. This means G1 contributes to resistance, but it's not absolutely essential. Its loss causes a 25% reduction in resistance.\n*   **g2 mutant (G2 knocked out):** 0% resistance. This means G2 is absolutely essential for any resistance to occur. Its loss completely abolishes the phenotype.\n*   **g3 mutant (G3 knocked out):** 50% resistance. This means G3 also contributes significantly to resistance. Its loss causes a 50% reduction in resistance.\n\n**2. Analyze the Double-Mutant Phenotypes to Identify Epistasis**\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene's mutation masks the effect of another gene's mutation. In a genetic pathway, an upstream gene is often epistatic to a downstream gene.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant's phenotype (0% resistance), not the `g1` mutant's (75%). When the double mutant phenotype resembles one of the single mutant phenotypes, the corresponding gene is considered epistatic. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance. Similarly, this phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant's phenotype (0%), not the `g3` mutant's (50%). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n\n**3. Conclude the Role of G2**\nSince G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, it very likely functions upstream of both of them in the resistance pathway. The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF) that acts upstream of others. G2's position as an upstream regulator makes it the prime candidate for the **transcription factor** that activates G1 and G3. This conclusion eliminates option A, which suggests G1 is the transcription factor.\n\nA plausible pathway diagram is:\n`G2 (TF) → activates both G1 and G3`\n\n**4. Analyze the Relationship Between G1 and G3**\nNow let's look at the interaction between G1 and G3, which are likely downstream of G2.\n\n*   **g1g3 double mutant:** 10% resistance.\n*   This phenotype (10%) is different from both the `g1` single mutant (75%) and the `g3` single mutant (50%). This means neither G1 nor G3 is epistatic to the other in the classical sense.\n*   Let's compare the combined effect to the individual effects. The loss of resistance in `g1` is 25%, and in `g3` is 50%. A simple additive effect would result in a 75% loss of resistance (leaving 25% resistance). However, the observed loss is 90% (leaving only 10% resistance). This much stronger, synergistic effect suggests that G1 and G3 have overlapping or related functions. When both are absent, the effect is much more severe than the sum of their individual effects. This type of interaction, where two genes perform similar functions, is best described as **gene redundancy**.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** Incorrect. G2 is the transcription factor, not G1.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n    *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* Correct.\n    *   *G1 and G3 show gene redundancy:* Correct. This is the best description for their synergistic interaction.\n    *   *G1 is epistatic towards G3:* This part is incorrect based on our analysis (the `g1g3` phenotype of 10% is not the same as the `g1` phenotype of 75%). However, the first two statements are strongly supported by the data.\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:**\n    *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* Correct.\n    *   *G1 and G3 has the same promoter:* We cannot determine this from the data.\n    *   *G3 is epistatic towards G1:* Incorrect.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n    *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* Correct.\n    *   *G1 and G3 show pleiotropy:* We cannot determine this. Pleiotropy means a gene affects multiple traits, and we only have data on one trait (resistance).\n    *   *G1 is epistatic towards G3:* Incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOption B contains two correct and highly plausible conclusions drawn directly from the data (G2 is the TF; G1 and G3 show redundancy). The other options contain statements that are either incorrect (A), speculative (C), or cannot be determined (D). Despite the final clause in option B being factually incorrect based on a classical definition of epistasis, it is the best overall choice as it most accurately describes the genetic relationships derived from the experiment.\n\n<<<B>>>"
