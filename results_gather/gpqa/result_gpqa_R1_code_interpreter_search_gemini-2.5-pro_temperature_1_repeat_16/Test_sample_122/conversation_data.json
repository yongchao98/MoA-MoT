    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   We have two inertial frames of reference.\n    *   The \"Galaxy frame\" (let's call it S) is the stationary frame from which we want to measure the distance.\n    *   The \"ejecta frame\" (let's call it S') is the moving frame. It is moving at a velocity `v` relative to the Galaxy frame.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it's measured by a clock that is at rest within the moving frame.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   The question asks for the distance `d` the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (frame S).\n\n4.  **Formulate the Physics Plan:**\n    *   The distance `d` in the Galaxy frame is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed *in the Galaxy frame*.\n    *   The velocity `v` is known (60,000 km/s), but we need to find `Δt`.\n    *   According to the theory of special relativity, an effect called \"time dilation\" occurs. A clock in a moving reference frame appears to run slower when observed from a stationary frame.\n    *   This means the time `Δt` measured in the stationary Galaxy frame will be longer than the proper time `Δt₀` (which is `Δt'`) measured in the moving ejecta frame.\n    *   The formula for time dilation is `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   We need the speed of light, `c`. A standard value used in physics problems is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, square this ratio:\n        `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n    *   Substitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula `Δt = γ * Δt₀`:\n        `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy Frame (d):**\n    *   Now substitute the expression for `Δt` into the distance formula `d = v * Δt`:\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s]`\n    *   Rearrange the terms for easier calculation:\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Numerical Value:**\n    *   We can use a calculator to find the value of `sqrt(0.96)`.\n    ```python\n    import math\n    \n    # Given values\n    v = 60000  # km/s\n    delta_t0 = 50  # s\n    \n    # Classical distance (without relativity)\n    d_classical = v * delta_t0\n    \n    # Use c = 300,000 km/s\n    c = 300000 # km/s\n    \n    # Calculate Lorentz factor (gamma)\n    beta_sq = (v/c)**2\n    gamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_sq)\n    \n    # Calculate the relativistic distance\n    d_relativistic = d_classical * gamma\n    \n    print(f\"Classical distance (for comparison): {d_classical} km\")\n    print(f\"v/c: {v/c}\")\n    print(f\"Lorentz factor (gamma): {gamma}\")\n    print(f\"Relativistic distance: {d_relativistic} km\")\n    ```\n    The calculation gives:\n    `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n9.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    *   The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n    *   Let's check the given options:\n        A) 2,940,000 km\n        B) 3,060,000 km\n        C) 2,880,000 km\n        D) 3,000,000 km\n    *   Our calculated value of 3,061,862 km is extremely close to option B, 3,060,000 km. The small difference is negligible and likely due to rounding in the problem's design.\n\n    *   **Qualitative check:** Because of time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (`Δt`) is *longer* than in the ejecta frame. Therefore, the distance traveled must be *greater* than the classical distance (`d_classical = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`). This immediately eliminates options A, C, and D, leaving only B as the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
