    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor. This means its net charge is zero. It has a cavity inside.\n\n2.  **Introduce the charge `+q`:** A small positive charge `+q` is placed somewhere inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Apply the principles of electrostatics for conductors:**\n    *   **Principle 1: The electric field inside the material of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero.**\n    *   To understand the implications, let's consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through this closed surface is equal to the net charge enclosed divided by $\\epsilon_o$ ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = Q_{enc}/\\epsilon_o$).\n    *   Since the electric field `E` is zero everywhere on this Gaussian surface (as it's inside the conductor), the total flux is zero.\n    *   This implies that the net charge enclosed ($Q_{enc}$) by this Gaussian surface must also be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge `+q` placed inside the cavity and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity ($q_{inner}$).\n    *   Therefore, $+q + q_{inner} = 0$, which means $q_{inner} = -q$.\n    *   So, a charge of `-q` is induced on the inner wall of the cavity. This induced charge will distribute itself non-uniformly on the inner surface to cancel the field of the `+q` charge within the conductor.\n\n4.  **Consider the charge on the outer surface:**\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged (net charge = 0).\n    *   We've just established that a charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface from the free electrons within the conductor.\n    *   To maintain overall charge neutrality for the conductor, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   So, we now have a charge of `+q` on the outer surface of the spherical conductor (the sphere of radius `R`).\n\n5.  **Determine the distribution of the outer charge:**\n    *   The problem is to find the electric field *outside* the conductor. The electric field outside is caused only by the charges on the outer surface.\n    *   The conducting material acts as an electrostatic shield. It isolates the exterior region from the electrostatic influence of the charges inside the cavity (`+q` and the induced `-q`).\n    *   Therefore, the charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself as if the cavity and its contents were not there.\n    *   Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external charges nearby, the charge `+q` will distribute itself **uniformly** over the outer surface.\n\n6.  **Calculate the electric field at point P:**\n    *   We now have a simplified problem: find the electric field at a point P due to a uniformly distributed charge `+q` on the surface of a sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   A well-known result from Gauss's Law (often called the Shell Theorem) states that the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated in a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is given as `L`.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$: This matches our result perfectly.\n    *   B), C), D): These options include parameters like `l`, `s`, and `\\theta`, which describe the position of the cavity and the point P relative to the cavity. Due to the electrostatic shielding effect of the conductor, these internal geometric details are irrelevant for the external electric field. They are distractors.\n\n**Conclusion:** The electric field outside the conductor depends only on the net charge that appears on the outer surface (`+q`) and the distance from the center of the conductor (`L`).\n\n<<<A>>>"
