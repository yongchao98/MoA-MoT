    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that constitute the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of this approximation and evaluate each statement.\n\nThe \"impulse approximation\" is used in scattering theory, particularly when a high-energy probe (like an electron or a neutrino) interacts with a nucleus. The core idea is that the interaction is very rapid and localized, allowing for significant simplifications. The name \"impulse\" comes from classical mechanics, where an impulse is a large force acting over a very short time interval, causing a change in momentum without a significant change in position.\n\nLet's analyze the given assumptions in this context:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the foundational assumption. It postulates that the probe interacts with a single nucleon at a time, rather than with a correlated pair of nucleons or with the nucleus as a whole through collective effects. This allows the total interaction to be treated as a sum of individual nucleon interactions. This is a crucial first step in simplifying the many-body problem.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This addresses what happens before and after the primary interaction. It assumes that the incoming probe does not interact with other nucleons on its way to the target nucleon (no initial-state interactions) and that the scattered probe and the struck nucleon do not re-interact with the remaining nucleons on their way out (no final-state interactions). This \"transparency\" assumption is essential for isolating the single-nucleon interaction event.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** This statement describes the internal structure of the nucleon itself. While models of the nucleon can involve relativistic or non-relativistic quarks, this is a separate issue from the impulse approximation. The impulse approximation states that the nucleon *within the nucleus* behaves like a *free nucleon*. The properties of that free nucleon (e.g., its form factors) are determined by its internal quark-gluon structure, but the choice of model for that structure (relativistic vs. non-relativistic) is not a defining feature of the impulse approximation itself. The approximation is about the nucleon's environment, not its internal composition. Therefore, this assumption is not a necessary component of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the heart of the \"impulse\" concept. The interaction with the high-energy probe is assumed to happen over a timescale that is much shorter than the characteristic time of the nucleon's motion within the nucleus. Because the interaction is so quick, the nucleon doesn't have time to interact with its neighbors via the nuclear potential. For that brief moment, it behaves as if it were a free particle, unbound from the nucleus. This justifies using the properties of a free nucleon (like its mass and form factors) in the calculation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe impulse approximation is defined by the combination of three key ideas:\n- The interaction happens on a single nucleon (Statement 1).\n- The nucleon is treated as unbound during the brief interaction (Statement 4).\n- The rest of the nucleus does not interfere with the incoming or outgoing particles (Statement 2).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
