    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. The presence of specific stereochemical descriptors like (R) or (S) indicates a specific enantiomer, which is optically active unless the molecule is an achiral meso compound.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure**: The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. C1 is bonded to H and Cl. C2 is bonded to a methyl group (-CH3) and an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The molecule is planar about the double bond. There are no chiral centers (carbon atoms with four different substituents). The plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The important part of the name for determining optical activity is `(3aR,7aS)`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: These descriptors indicate the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3a and 7a). The naming of a molecule as a single, specific enantiomer (by using R/S notation) implies that the molecule is chiral. While some molecules with multiple stereocenters can be achiral (meso compounds), the complex and asymmetric nature of this substituted methanoisobenzofuran derivative (especially with the substituent at position 8) makes it highly unlikely to have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure**: This is succinic acid with methyl groups on C2 and C3. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The molecule has two identical ends (COOH) and two stereocenters with opposite configurations (2R, 3S). This is a classic example of a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry, despite having stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure**: Same base structure as the previous compound, but with different stereochemistry.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The two stereocenters have the same configuration (2R, 3R). This molecule is chiral and does not have an internal plane of symmetry. Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) compound, and they are non-superimposable. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure**: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and a hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The name specifies the (R) configuration at C1. Let's verify C1 is a stereocenter. It is bonded to four different groups: (1) -H, (2) -OH, (3) the `-CH2-CH=CH-` part of the ring, and (4) the `-CH2-CH2-` part of the ring. Since the paths around the ring from C1 are different, the four groups are different. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter. The molecule as a whole lacks any symmetry elements that would make it achiral. The name designates a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure**: A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` is an older nomenclature indicating that all substituents have the same relative configuration (all cis).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: In the all-cis isomer, all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring. In a chair conformation, this means they are either all axial or all equatorial. This highly symmetric arrangement results in the molecule having multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through the C1-O bond and the C4 atom bisects the ring, with C2 reflecting onto C6 and C3 reflecting onto C5. Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a ketone with a cyclopentyl group on one side of the carbonyl and a 3-methylbutyl (isopentyl) group on the other. The structure is `Cyclopentyl-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: We need to check for any stereocenters.\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring consists of only -CH2- groups.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized.\n        *   In the 3-methylbutyl group, the carbon at position 3, `-CH(CH3)2`, is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the chain. Since it's bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter.\n        *   The molecule has no stereocenters and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   **Active**: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.\n*   **Inactive**: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.\n\nThere are **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
