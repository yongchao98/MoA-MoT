    "The user wants to determine the required energy difference to resolve two quantum states with given lifetimes.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principle:**\nThe problem connects the lifetime of a quantum state (Δt) to the uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). This relationship is described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time:\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant. The term ΔE represents the \"natural linewidth\" or the inherent \"fuzziness\" of the energy level. A shorter lifetime (Δt) leads to a larger energy uncertainty (ΔE), meaning the energy level is less precisely defined.\n\n**2. Define \"Clearly Resolved\":**\nFor two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than the combined uncertainty of the two levels. A standard criterion for this is that the energy separation must be greater than the sum of the individual energy uncertainties (linewidths).\nSo, the condition is: |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Uncertainties:**\nWe can calculate the energy uncertainty for each state using ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt. It's most convenient to use the value of ħ in units of eV·s.\n*   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n*   Lifetime of state 1 (Δt1) = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Lifetime of state 2 (Δt2) = 10⁻⁸ s\n\nNow, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each state.\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    ΔE2 ≈ ħ / Δt2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**4. Apply the Resolution Condition:**\nThe minimum energy difference required for the levels to be resolved is the sum of their individual uncertainties:\nMinimum |E1 - E2| = ΔE1 + ΔE2\nMinimum |E1 - E2| ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\nMinimum |E1 - E2| ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\nMinimum |E1 - E2| ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nSo, to be clearly resolved, the energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**5. Compare with the Options:**\nLet's examine the given options:\nA) 10⁻⁹ eV  (Smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\nB) 10⁻¹¹ eV (Smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\nC) 10⁻⁸ eV  (Smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\nD) 10⁻⁴ eV  (Larger than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\nOnly option D provides an energy difference large enough to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, as it is the only value greater than the combined energy uncertainty of the states.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nh_bar_eV_s = 6.582119569e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n\n# Lifetimes of the states\ndelta_t1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ndelta_t2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (natural linewidth, FWHM) for each state using ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eV_s / delta_t1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eV_s / delta_t2\n\n# The condition for the levels to be clearly resolved is that their energy difference\n# must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties.\nmin_energy_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Required minimum energy difference |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2: {min_energy_difference:.4e} eV\")\n\n# Compare with options\noptions = {'A': 1e-9, 'B': 1e-11, 'C': 1e-8, 'D': 1e-4}\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    if value > min_energy_difference:\n        print(f\"Option {key}) {value:.1e} eV is a possible energy difference.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {key}) {value:.1e} eV is NOT a possible energy difference.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>",
