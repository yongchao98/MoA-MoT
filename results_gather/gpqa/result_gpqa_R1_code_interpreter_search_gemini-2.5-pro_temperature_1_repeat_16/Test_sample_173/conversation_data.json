    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:** A single nucleus at rest.\n    *   Initial total energy, E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV.\n    *   Initial momentum, p_initial = 0.\n\n*   **Final State:** Two fragments moving apart.\n    *   Let their rest-masses be m1 and m2, and their kinetic energies be T1 and T2.\n    *   The problem states that the more massive fragment is fragment 1, so m1 > m2.\n\n### 2. Use the Given Information to Find Masses and Total Kinetic Energy\n\n*   **Mass Ratio:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other:\n    *   m1 = 2 * m2\n    *   This also means their rest-mass energies are in the same ratio: m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2.\n\n*   **Sum of Masses:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.\n    *   (m1 + m2) * c^2 = 0.99 * (M * c^2)\n    *   (m1 + m2) * c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n\n*   **Calculate Individual Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   We have a system of two equations:\n        1.  m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV\n        2.  m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2\n    *   Substitute (2) into (1):\n        *   (2 * m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV\n        *   3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV\n        *   m2*c^2 = 99 GeV (Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment)\n    *   Now find m1*c^2:\n        *   m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV (Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment)\n\n*   **Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\n    *   Energy is conserved. The initial rest-mass energy is converted into the final rest-mass energy plus the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)\n    *   M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) + (T1 + T2)\n    *   The total kinetic energy is T_total = T1 + T2.\n    *   T_total = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n    *   T_total = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum (Classical):** The initial momentum is zero, so the final momenta must be equal and opposite.\n    *   p1 = p2 (in magnitude)\n    *   m1 * v1 = m2 * v2\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy (Classical):** T = p^2 / (2m).\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)\n    *   T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)\n    *   (T1_classical) / (T2_classical) = m2 / m1\n*   **Solve for T1_classical:**\n    *   Since m1 = 2 * m2, the ratio is T1_classical / T2_classical = 1/2, which means T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical.\n    *   We know T1_classical + T2_classical = T_total = 3 GeV.\n    *   T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV\n    *   3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV\n    *   T1_classical = 1 GeV.\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum (Relativistic):** The magnitudes of the momenta are equal.\n    *   |p1| = |p2| = p\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2, where E is the total energy (rest + kinetic), E = T + m*c^2.\n*   From this, we can write (p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, the (p*c)^2 terms are equal for both fragments:\n    *   (p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2\n    *   E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\n*   Substitute E1 = T1 + m1*c^2 and E2 = T2 + m2*c^2:\n    *   (T1 + m1*c^2)^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (T2 + m2*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\n*   Substitute the known values and T2 = T_total - T1 = 3 - T1:\n    *   m1*c^2 = 198 GeV\n    *   m2*c^2 = 99 GeV\n    *   T_total = 3 GeV\n    *   (T1 + 198)^2 - (198)^2 = ((3 - T1) + 99)^2 - (99)^2\n    *   (T1 + 198)^2 - 198^2 = (102 - T1)^2 - 99^2\n*   Expand the terms (using a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b) is efficient):\n    *   (T1)(T1 + 2*198) = (102 - T1 - 99)(102 - T1 + 99)\n    *   T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1)(201 - T1)\n    *   T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 201*T1 - 3*T1 + T1^2\n    *   T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2\n*   Cancel T1^2 from both sides and solve for T1:\n    *   396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1\n    *   (396 + 204)*T1 = 603\n    *   600*T1 = 603\n    *   T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV.\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\n*   Convert the kinetic energies to Mega-electron Volts (MeV) since the options are in MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV).\n    *   T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV.\n    *   T1 (correct) = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV.\n*   Calculate the difference:\n    *   Difference = |T1 - T1_classical| = |1005 MeV - 1000 MeV| = 5 MeV.\n\nTo confirm the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\n# All energy values are in GeV.\n\n# Initial rest-mass energy\nM_c2 = 300.0\n\n# Sum of final rest-mass energies\nm_sum_c2 = 0.99 * M_c2\n\n# Individual rest-mass energies\n# m1_c2 = 2 * m2_c2 and m1_c2 + m2_c2 = m_sum_c2\nm2_c2 = m_sum_c2 / 3.0\nm1_c2 = 2.0 * m2_c2\n\n# Total kinetic energy released\nT_total = M_c2 - m_sum_c2\n\n# Classical T1\nT1_classical = T_total / 3.0\n\n# Relativistic T1\n# Derived from (T1 + m1c^2)^2 - (m1c^2)^2 = ((T_total - T1) + m2c^2)^2 - (m2c^2)^2\nT1_relativistic = (T_total * (T_total + 2 * m2_c2)) / (2 * M_c2)\n\n# Difference in MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV)\ndifference_MeV = (T1_relativistic - T1_classical) * 1000\n\nprint(f\"The difference is: {difference_MeV} MeV\")\n```\n>>>\nInitial rest-mass energy (Mc^2): 300.0 GeV\nSum of fragment rest-mass energies (m1c^2 + m2c^2): 297.0 GeV\nRest-mass energy of massive fragment (m1c^2): 198.0 GeV\nRest-mass energy of lighter fragment (m2c^2): 99.0 GeV\nTotal kinetic energy released (T_total): 3.0 GeV\nClassical T1: 1.0 GeV\nRelativistic T1: 1.005 GeV\nDifference in GeV: 0.005000000000000116 GeV\nDifference in MeV: 5.000000000000116\n<<<B>>>",
    "**1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A single atomic nucleus at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum: `p_initial = 0`. Since the nucleus is at rest, its total energy is its rest-mass energy.\n\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, let's call them fragment 1 and fragment 2.\n    *   Let their rest-masses be `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Let their kinetic energies be `T1` and `T2`.\n\n*   **Given Conditions:**\n    *   `m1 = 2 * m2` (Fragment 1 is the more massive one).\n    *   `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (M * c^2)` (The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass).\n    *   We need to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, `T1`.\n    *   The final goal is the difference between the correct relativistic value of `T1` and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) physics, `T1_classical`.\n\n**2. Calculate Masses and Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n\nFirst, let's find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments.\n*   Sum of final rest-mass energies: `(m1 + m2) * c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We have a system of two equations:\n    1.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n*   Substitute the second equation into the first:\n    `2*m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    `3*m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV` (This is the rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment).\n*   Now, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n    `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\nNext, let's find the total kinetic energy `(T_total)` released in the fission. This is the \"Q-value\" of the reaction and comes from the conversion of mass into energy.\n*   By conservation of energy: `E_initial = E_final`\n    `M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n    `M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) + (T1 + T2)`\n*   The total kinetic energy is `T_total = T1 + T2`:\n    `T_total = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n    `T_total = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, we use the following principles:\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. The two fragments move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes.\n    `p1 = p2`\n*   **Kinetic Energy:** The classical formula is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   From this, we can establish a ratio between the kinetic energies:\n    `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\n    So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   We know that `T1_classical + T2_classical = T_total = 3 GeV`.\n    Substituting `T2_classical`: `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the principles are slightly different:\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** This still holds. The magnitudes of the momenta are equal: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** The relationship is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`, where `E` is the total energy (`E = T + m*c^2`).\n*   We can express `(p*c)^2` as `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, their `(p*c)^2` terms must be equal:\n    `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n*   Substitute `E1 = T1 + m1*c^2` and `E2 = T2 + m2*c^2 = (T_total - T1) + m2*c^2`:\n    `(T1 + m1*c^2)^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = ((T_total - T1) + m2*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n*   Now, plug in the energy values (in GeV):\n    `m1*c^2 = 198`, `m2*c^2 = 99`, `T_total = 3`.\n    `(T1 + 198)^2 - 198^2 = ((3 - T1) + 99)^2 - 99^2`\n    `(T1 + 198)^2 - 198^2 = (102 - T1)^2 - 99^2`\n*   Expand the terms (using the identity a² - b² = (a-b)(a+b) simplifies this):\n    `T1 * (T1 + 2*198) = (102 - T1 - 99) * (102 - T1 + 99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 201*T1 - 3*T1 + T1^2`\n*   Cancel `T1^2` from both sides:\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   Solve for the correct `T1`:\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Difference**\n\nNow we find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation. It is convenient to convert the units to MeV, as requested by the options (1 GeV = 1000 MeV).\n\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n*   `T1_correct = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n*   `Difference = T1_correct - T1_classical = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
