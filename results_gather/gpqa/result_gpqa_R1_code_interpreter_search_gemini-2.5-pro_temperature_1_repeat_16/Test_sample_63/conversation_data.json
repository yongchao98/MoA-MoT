    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental results to identify the gaseous products.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = mass / molar mass = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, etc. Since the weight of this tube did not change, it means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition of the salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This means an oxidizing gas passed through the tube and reacted with copper. The increase in mass is solely due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Reaction: `Gas-O + Cu → CuO + ...`\n    *   The mass increase is the mass of oxygen. Mass of O = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = mass / molar mass = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the reagents used.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n**2. Formulate a hypothesis about the identity of salts A and B.**\n\n*   The initial substance is a mixture of two salts, A and B, that decompose upon heating to form *only* a mixture of gases. This is a very strong clue. This behavior is characteristic of certain ammonium salts of volatile acids, particularly those containing oxygen and nitrogen.\n*   The products include water (H₂O), an oxygen-providing gas, and an inert gas. This strongly suggests the salts are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n*   Let's assume this hypothesis is correct and test it against the experimental data.\n    *   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)**\n    *   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)** (at ~200°C)\n\n**3. Test the hypothesis using the quantitative data.**\n\n*   The gas mixture produced would consist of N₂, N₂O, and H₂O.\n    *   N₂ is inert. It would be the final gas C (or part of it).\n    *   N₂O is an oxidizing gas. It would react with hot copper: **N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂**.\n    *   H₂O is absorbed by Mg(ClO₄)₂.\n    *   No acidic gases are produced, which is consistent with the observation for tube №2.\n\n*   Let `n` be the number of moles for each salt, since the initial mixture is equimolar.\n    *   From the decomposition reactions:\n        *   Moles of N₂ produced = `n` (from NH₄NO₂)\n        *   Moles of N₂O produced = `n` (from NH₄NO₃)\n        *   Total moles of H₂O produced = `2n` (from NH₄NO₂) + `2n` (from NH₄NO₃) = `4n`.\n\n*   Now, let's use the experimental mole quantities:\n    *   We found that 0.2 mol of H₂O was produced. So, `4n = 0.2 mol`, which gives **`n = 0.05 mol`**.\n    *   This means the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of salt A (NH₄NO₂) and 0.05 mol of salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   Let's check the other products:\n    *   Moles of N₂O produced = `n` = 0.05 mol. When this reacts with copper (`N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂`), it provides 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Mass of oxygen = 0.05 mol * 16 g/mol = 0.80 g. This perfectly matches the mass increase of tube №3.\n    *   The gas remaining (gas C) would be all the nitrogen. This includes the initial N₂ from the decomposition of NH₄NO₂ and the N₂ produced from the reaction of N₂O with copper.\n    *   Total moles of N₂ = (moles N₂ from NH₄NO₂) + (moles N₂ from N₂O reaction) = `n` + `n` = 0.05 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   The volume of this gas at STP is 0.1 mol * 22.4 L/mol = 2.24 L. This perfectly matches the volume of gas C.\n\n**4. Verify the initial mass.**\n\n*   Molar mass of A (NH₄NO₂) = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of B (NH₄NO₃) = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (moles of A × molar mass of A) + (moles of B × molar mass of B)\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n*   This matches the given initial weight of the mixture. The hypothesis is fully confirmed.\n\n**5. Determine the total number of atoms.**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** The formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** The formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
