    "*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:** The presence of two distinct peaks for a single proton, with equal integrals summing to the expected value (1H), indicates the presence of two different chemical species in a 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, these two species must be isomers of some kind. The similar chemical shifts suggest the isomers are structurally very similar.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The LC-MS shows two separate peaks, confirming the presence of two distinct compounds that can be separated by chromatography. The fact that they have equal intensities reinforces the 1:1 ratio observed in the NMR. Crucially, both peaks show the *same mass spectrum*, which matches the expected molecule. This tells us that the two species are isomers â€“ they have the same chemical formula and molecular weight.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight. The MS data contradicts this, as both peaks have the same, expected mass.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. Under standard (achiral) NMR and LC conditions, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce a single set of peaks in the NMR and a single peak in the LC. To separate them, a chiral environment (e.g., a chiral LC column) would be required, which is not specified. Therefore, this explanation does not fit the data.\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would result in a product with a higher molecular weight (e.g., adding an extra amino acid). The MS data, showing the expected mass, rules this out.\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties. Because they are chemically distinct, they have different NMR spectra (even in an achiral solvent) and can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography. This perfectly explains why there are two peaks for the alpha-proton in the NMR and two separate peaks in the LC. Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data. A common cause of diastereomer formation in peptide synthesis is the epimerization (racemization) of one of the chiral centers during a coupling step, leading to a mixture of, for example, an L-L peptide and an L-D peptide, which are diastereomers. Another possibility is the presence of cis/trans isomers around an amide bond (especially involving proline), which are also considered diastereomers (specifically, rotamers).\n\n**Conclusion:** The observation of two separable species by LC that have identical mass spectra but distinct NMR spectra is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n<<<D>>>"
