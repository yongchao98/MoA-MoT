    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{eff}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_*$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are the same for both. It also states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    To find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n4.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) for each planet. The RV semi-amplitude (K) is the maximum radial velocity of the star induced by the planet and is related to the Doppler shift by:\n    $K = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0} c$\n    where c is the speed of light.\n\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude is also given by:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{1 - e^2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{M_* + M_p}}$\n    Given that the orbits are circular, the eccentricity $e=0$. The problem also states the planets were detected by the transit method, which implies the inclination $i$ is close to 90°, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The planet mass ($M_p$) is much smaller than the star mass ($M_*$), so $M_* + M_p \\approx M_*$. The formula simplifies to:\n    $K \\approx M_p \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a M_*}}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We rearrange the simplified formula to solve for `a`:\n    $K^2 \\approx M_p^2 \\frac{G}{a M_*}$\n    $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{K^2 M_*}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (K_2^2 M_*)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (K_1^2 M_*)}$\n    The gravitational constant G and the star's mass $M_*$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2}{M_{p1}^2} \\frac{K_1^2}{K_2^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Individual Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:**\n        $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio:**\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(\\Delta \\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0) c}{(\\Delta \\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0) c} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ \\text{Å}}{0.04 \\ \\text{Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n8.  **Substitute Ratios to find $a_2/a_1$:**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n10. **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    To get the decimal value, we perform the division.\n```python\nprint(15 / 28)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_result>\nThe result is approximately 0.536.

    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet ($T_{eq}$) is given by the equation:\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_{eff}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_*$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 to Planet2 ($T_{eq1}/T_{eq2}$).\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, $T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are the same. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nNow we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2/a_1$. We can use the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude (K) is related to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) by $K = c \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit ($e=0$) and assuming the inclination $i \\approx 90°$ (since transits are observed), the RV semi-amplitude can be approximated as:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{M_*}}$\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_*$ is the star's mass, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for $a$:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K} \\implies a \\propto \\left( \\frac{M_p}{K} \\right)^2$\n\nNow we can form the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{(M_{p2}/K_2)^2}{(M_{p1}/K_1)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is the same as the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ \\text{Å}}{0.04 \\ \\text{Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nThe ratio of the planetary masses is:\n$\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\nNow, substitute these ratios back into the equation for $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nFinally, calculate the temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
