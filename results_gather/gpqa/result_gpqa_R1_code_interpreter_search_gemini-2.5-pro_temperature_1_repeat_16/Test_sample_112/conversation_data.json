    "*   **Analysis of FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. This frequency is typical for the C=O group within a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is in the region for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a C=C double bond.\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens directly confirms the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). Vinyl hydrogens are the hydrogen atoms attached to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a very common and indicative fragment for a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Let's calculate the mass of [COOH]⁺: Mass = Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 2 * 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n\n*   **Synthesizing the Information and Determining the Molecular Formula:**\n    1.  The combined data strongly indicate that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It has both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a C=C double bond.\n    2.  A functional group requires a certain number of atoms. A carboxylic acid group requires two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options C (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    3.  We are left with two choices: A) C6H12O2 and B) C6H10O2. To differentiate between them, we use the concept of the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    4.  The formula for DoU is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens (we can ignore oxygen for this calculation).\n    5.  Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 means one double bond or one ring. A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) already contains one C=O double bond. Therefore, a compound with the formula C6H12O2 would be a *saturated* carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid). This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data, which show a C=C double bond.\n        *   **B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. A DoU of 2 means there are two double bonds, or one triple bond, or one double bond and one ring. Our evidence points to one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene part). This perfectly matches a DoU of 2.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid with six carbons. The molecular formula must be C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
