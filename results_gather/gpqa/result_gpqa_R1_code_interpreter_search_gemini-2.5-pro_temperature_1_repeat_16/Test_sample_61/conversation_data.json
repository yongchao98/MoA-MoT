    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. Its structure is a cyclohexane ring attached to an ethynyl group (-C≡CH). Let's denote the cyclohexyl group as 'Cy'. So, the structure is Cy-C≡CH.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's dissect this IUPAC name to determine the structure.\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This is a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde (-CHO) group attached. The ring carbon attached to the -CHO group is numbered C1.\n    *   The prefix `1-(...)` indicates a substituent is attached to the C1 carbon of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The substituent is `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`. This describes a methyl group (-CH3) where one hydrogen is replaced by a cyclohexyl group (-Cy) and another hydrogen is replaced by a hydroxy group (-OH). So the substituent is -CH(OH)Cy.\n    *   Putting it all together: The C1 of a cyclohexane ring is bonded to four different groups: C2 of the ring, C6 of the ring, a -CHO group, and a -CH(OH)Cy group. This C1 is a quaternary carbon.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** The product contains two cyclohexyl groups, while the starting material has only one. This implies that two molecules derived from the starting material must have been joined together. The structure of the final product, specifically the β-hydroxy aldehyde motif (if you consider the Cy-CH(OH)-C(CHO)-Cy backbone), is the characteristic product of an **aldol addition reaction**. The product is formed by the self-aldol addition of two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO).\n\n    *   **Aldol Reaction Mechanism:**\n        1.  An enolate is formed from one molecule of Cy-CHO by removing the α-proton (the proton on C1 of the ring) with a base.\n        2.  This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of Cy-CHO.\n        3.  Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields the final β-hydroxy aldehyde product.\n\n**2. Outline the Overall Synthesis Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must proceed in two major stages:\n*   **Stage 1:** Convert the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane (Cy-C≡CH), into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO).\n*   **Stage 2:** Perform a self-aldol addition reaction on cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final product.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences (Options A-D)**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if it correctly executes this two-stage strategy.\n\n*   **Common First Step:** All plausible options (A, B, C) start with `NaNH2` followed by an alkyl halide. NaNH2 is a strong base that deprotonates the terminal alkyne:\n    `Cy-C≡CH + NaNH2 → Cy-C≡C⁻Na⁺`\n    This acetylide anion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the alkyl halide (e.g., methyl chloride, CH3Cl) to extend the carbon chain:\n    `Cy-C≡C⁻Na⁺ + CH3Cl → Cy-C≡C-CH3`\n    This step is crucial because it creates an internal alkyne, which can be cleaved at a specific position to yield the desired cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\nNow let's look at each option in detail:\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    1.  `NaNH2, ethyl chloride`: Forms `Cy-C≡C-CH2CH3`.\n    2.  `Li/liq. NH3`: Reduces the alkyne to a *trans*-alkene, `Cy-CH=CH-CH2CH3`.\n    3.  `O3/ H2O`: This is **oxidative ozonolysis**. It cleaves the double bond but oxidizes the resulting aldehydes to carboxylic acids. This would produce `Cy-COOH` and `CH3CH2COOH`. Carboxylic acids cannot undergo an aldol addition. Therefore, **Option A is incorrect**.\n    4.  `NH4OH`: A weak base, irrelevant after forming carboxylic acids.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    1.  `NaNH2, methyl chloride`: Forms `Cy-C≡C-CH3`.\n    2.  The steps are listed in a confusing order (`H2/Pd`, `Ba(OH)2`, `H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O`). Let's assume the intended sequence involves hydration of the alkyne:\n        `Cy-C≡C-CH3 + H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → Cy-C(=O)-CH2CH3` (a ketone).\n    An aldol reaction on this ketone would not lead to the target aldehyde product. Therefore, **Option C is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    1.  `NaNH2, methanol`: `NaNH2` is a very strong base and would react with methanol (`CH3OH`), a weak acid, in an acid-base reaction (`NaNH2 + CH3OH → NaOCH3 + NH3`). This does not achieve the necessary carbon-carbon bond formation (alkylation) to set up the subsequent cleavage. Therefore, **Option D is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    1.  `NaNH2, methyl chloride`: Correctly forms the internal alkyne, `Cy-C≡C-CH3`.\n    2.  `H2/Pd-calcium carbonate`: This is Lindlar's catalyst, which correctly performs a partial hydrogenation to form the *cis*-alkene, `Cy-CH=CH-CH3`. (The stereochemistry is not critical for the next step).\n    3.  `O3/ (CH3)2S`: This is **reductive ozonolysis**. It cleaves the double bond to form aldehydes without over-oxidation. This step correctly produces a mixture of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO)** and **acetaldehyde (CH3CHO)**. This successfully completes Stage 1 of our strategy.\n    4.  `Ba(OH)2`: This is a strong base used to catalyze the aldol addition reaction. This step is intended to perform Stage 2. Although reacting a mixture of two different aldehydes (both with α-protons) typically yields a mixture of four different aldol products, this option provides the only chemically viable pathway to generate the necessary precursor (Cy-CHO) and then apply aldol conditions. Among the given choices, this is the only sequence where all transformations are chemically sound and lead towards the desired product type.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy eliminating the incorrect options, we are left with Option B as the only plausible pathway. It correctly synthesizes cyclohexanecarbaldehyde via alkylation, partial reduction, and reductive ozonolysis, and then employs a base to induce an aldol reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
