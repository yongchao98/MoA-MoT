    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-, in a buffer solution.\n\n1.  **Understand the components of the solution:**\n    *   The solution is made by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O) in water.\n    *   KH2PO4 dissociates completely to provide K+ and dihydrogen phosphate ions (H2PO4-).\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates completely to provide Na+ and hydrogen phosphate ions (HPO4^2-).\n    *   The key species are H2PO4- (a weak acid) and HPO4^2- (its conjugate base). These form a buffer solution.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components:**\n    *   Volume of solution (V) = 200.00 cm3 = 0.2000 L.\n    *   Mass of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g. Molar mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol.\n        *   Since KH2PO4 -> K+ + H2PO4-, moles of H2PO4- = 0.007348 mol.\n        *   Initial concentration [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.2000 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g. Molar mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol.\n        *   Since Na2HPO4●2H2O -> 2Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2H2O, moles of HPO4^2- = 0.005618 mol.\n        *   Initial concentration [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.2000 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the relevant equilibria:**\n    *   The phosphoric acid (H3PO4) system has three dissociation steps:\n        1.  H3PO4 <=> H+ + H2PO4-  (Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3)\n        2.  H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8)\n        3.  HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-  (Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12)\n    *   Since our solution contains H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, the primary equilibrium that determines the pH is the second one. The orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is produced in the third equilibrium.\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the buffer equilibrium (Ka2):**\n    *   From the second equilibrium expression: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    *   We can assume that the equilibrium concentrations of the buffer components are approximately equal to their initial concentrations because the Ka values are small.\n    *   Rearranging for [H+]: [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n    *   [H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    *   [H+] ≈ 8.11x10^-8 M\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] using the third equilibrium (Ka3):**\n    *   From the third equilibrium expression: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    *   Rearranging for [PO4^3-]: [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n    *   Now, we substitute the values we've calculated:\n    *   [PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10^-8 M)\n    *   [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.23x10^-7 M\n\nTo avoid rounding errors, we can perform the calculation in a single step using a script.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.2000  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles\nmoles_KH2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4  # This is moles of H2PO4-\nmoles_Na2HPO4_2H2O = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O  # This is moles of HPO4^2-\n\n# Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_KH2PO4 / volume_L\nconc_HPO4_2_minus = moles_Na2HPO4_2H2O / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [H+] from the Ka2 equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] -> [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2_minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] -> [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nconc_PO4_3_minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2_minus / conc_H_plus)\n\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3_minus:.2e}\")\n```\n executing code:\n>>> 6.24e-07\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) is 6.24x10^-7 M.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 3.97x10^-7 M\nB) 5.48x10^-7 M\nC) 2.81x10^-7 M\nD) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their roles:**\n    *   The solution contains KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O.\n    *   In water, KH₂PO₄ dissociates completely into K⁺ ions and H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate) ions.\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O dissociates completely into Na⁺ ions and HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate) ions.\n    *   The key species are H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base, HPO₄²⁻. These two form a buffer solution. The pH of this buffer is governed by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka₂.\n\n2.  **Calculate the molar concentrations of the buffer components:**\n    *   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.2000 L.\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles.\n    *   Since KH₂PO₄ provides one H₂PO₄⁻ ion, the moles of H₂PO₄⁻ are also 0.007348 mol.\n    *   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻, [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.2000 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles.\n    *   Since Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O provides one HPO₄²⁻ ion, the moles of HPO₄²⁻ are also 0.005618 mol.\n    *   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻, [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.2000 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺]:**\n    *   The relevant equilibrium for the buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n        H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   The equilibrium expression is Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻].\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ × ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   Assuming the initial concentrations are approximately equal to the equilibrium concentrations (a valid assumption for a buffer), we can plug in the values:\n        [H⁺] = (6.2 × 10⁻⁸) × (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.113 × 10⁻⁸ M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration, [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is produced in the third dissociation step:\n        HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   The equilibrium expression for this step is Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻].\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ × ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   Now, we substitute the known and calculated values. We use the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] as its equilibrium concentration, which is a very safe assumption since Ka₃ is extremely small.\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 × 10⁻¹²) × (0.02809 M / (8.113 × 10⁻⁸ M))\n        [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThe calculation was performed accurately using the provided Python script, which yielded a result of 6.24e-07 M. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
