    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThis problem involves a particle decay at rest. The two key principles we need to apply are:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n**2. Define Variables and Initial Conditions**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu\n*   **Initial State:** The positive pion (Pi+) is stationary.\n    *   Mass of Pi(+): `m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c²`\n    *   Momentum of Pi(+): `p_pi = 0`\n    *   Total energy of Pi(+): `E_pi = m_pi * c²` (since it's at rest, its energy is its rest energy).\n*   **Final State:** The products are a positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu).\n    *   Mass of mu(+): `m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²`\n    *   Mass of nu: `m_nu = 0` (Neutrinos have a very small mass, which is negligible in this context and can be treated as zero for this calculation).\n    *   Energy and momentum of the products: `E_mu`, `p_mu`, `E_nu`, `p_nu`.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final total momentum must also be zero.\n`p_initial = p_final`\n`0 = p_mu + p_nu` (vector sum)\nThis implies that the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n`|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe initial energy is the rest energy of the pion. The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n`E_initial = E_final`\n`m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu`\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n*   For the muon (mu+): `E_mu = sqrt((p*c)² + (m_mu*c²)²)`\n*   For the neutrino (nu), since `m_nu = 0`: `E_nu = sqrt((p*c)² + 0) = p*c`\n\nSubstitute these into the energy conservation equation:\n`m_pi * c² = sqrt((p*c)² + (m_mu*c²)²) + p*c`\n\n**5. Solve for the Energy of the Particles**\n\nOur goal is to find the kinetic energies, `KE_mu` and `KE_nu`. Let's first solve for `p*c`, which is the total energy (and also the kinetic energy) of the massless neutrino (`E_nu = KE_nu = p*c`).\n\nRearrange the equation:\n`m_pi * c² - p*c = sqrt((p*c)² + (m_mu*c²)²)`\n\nSquare both sides:\n`(m_pi * c² - p*c)² = (p*c)² + (m_mu*c²)²`\n` (m_pi*c²)² - 2*(m_pi*c²)*(p*c) + (p*c)² = (p*c)² + (m_mu*c²)² `\n\nThe `(p*c)²` term cancels out on both sides:\n`(m_pi*c²)² - 2*(m_pi*c²)*(p*c) = (m_mu*c²)²`\n\nNow, solve for `p*c`:\n`2*(m_pi*c²)*(p*c) = (m_pi*c²)² - (m_mu*c²)²`\n`p*c = [ (m_pi*c²)² - (m_mu*c²)² ] / [ 2*(m_pi*c²) ]`\n\nSince `E_nu = KE_nu = p*c`, we can calculate the neutrino's kinetic energy. We can simplify the units by letting `c=1` and using the mass values directly in MeV.\n`KE_nu = [ (m_pi)² - (m_mu)² ] / [ 2 * m_pi ]`\n\nOnce we have `KE_nu`, we can find `KE_mu`. The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest masses:\n`Q = KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi*c² - m_mu*c²`\nTherefore:\n`KE_mu = (m_pi - m_mu) - KE_nu`\n\n**6. Calculation**\n\nLet's use Python to compute the precise values.\n\n```python\nm_pi = 139.6  # MeV\nm_mu = 105.7  # MeV\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino using the derived formula\n# KE_nu = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 * m_pi)\nke_nu = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest mass.\n# Q = m_pi - m_mu\n# This total KE is shared between the two product particles: Q = KE_mu + KE_nu\n# Therefore, KE_mu = Q - KE_nu\nke_mu = (m_pi - m_mu) - ke_nu\n\nprint(f\"KE of mu(+): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of nu: {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nKE of mu(+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of nu: 29.78 MeV\n</execute_code>\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculations show that the kinetic energy of the positive muon `(mu+)` is approximately **4.12 MeV**, and the kinetic energy of the muon neutrino `(nu)` is approximately **29.8 MeV** (rounding 29.78).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu). To find the kinetic energies of the product particles, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum:**\n\n*   The initial particle, the pion (Pi+), is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the products must also be zero.\n*   This means the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu) must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's denote this momentum magnitude as `p`.\n    `p_mu = p_nu = p`\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy:**\n\n*   The total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the stationary pion, `E_initial = m_pi * c²`.\n*   The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino, `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`.\n*   Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation `E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²`:\n    *   For the muon: `E_mu = sqrt((pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²)`.\n    *   For the neutrino, we assume it is massless (`m_nu = 0`), so its energy is `E_nu = pc`.\n*   Equating initial and final energies:\n    `m_pi * c² = sqrt((pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²) + pc`\n\n**3. Solving for Energies:**\n\nWe can rearrange the energy conservation equation to solve for `pc`, which is the energy (and also the kinetic energy) of the massless neutrino:\n\n`m_pi * c² - pc = sqrt((pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²)`\n\nSquaring both sides gives:\n`(m_pi * c²)² - 2(m_pi * c²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n\nThe `(pc)²` terms cancel out. Solving for `pc` (which is `KE_nu`), we get:\n`KE_nu = pc = [(m_pi * c²)² - (m_mu * c²)²] / [2 * m_pi * c²]`\n\nOnce we find the kinetic energy of the neutrino (`KE_nu`), we can find the kinetic energy of the muon (`KE_mu`). The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest energies, which is shared between the products:\n`KE_total = KE_mu + KE_nu = (m_pi - m_mu) * c²`\nTherefore:\n`KE_mu = (m_pi - m_mu) * c² - KE_nu`\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nUsing the given rest mass values:\n*   `m_pi = 139.6 MeV`\n*   `m_mu = 105.7 MeV`\n\nFrom the executed code:\n*   The kinetic energy of the neutrino is calculated as:\n    `KE_nu = (139.6² - 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6) = 29.78 MeV`\n*   The kinetic energy of the muon is calculated as:\n    `KE_mu = (139.6 - 105.7) - 29.78 = 4.12 MeV`\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately **4.12 MeV** for the muon (mu+) and **29.8 MeV** (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino (nu). This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
