    "This problem asks for the sequence of reactions that leads to the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene.\n\nLet's analyze the target molecule first. The structure is a benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n\nThe key to designing a synthesis for multisubstituted benzenes is to introduce the groups in an order that leverages their directing effects to achieve the desired regiochemistry.\n\nLet's evaluate the directing effects of the substituents:\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho/para director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho/para director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta director.\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve directly. A common strategy is to use a \"blocking group\" to control the position of substitution, and then remove it later. Sulfonic acid (-SO3H) is a good blocking group because sulfonation is reversible.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options step-by-step.\n\n**Option A & C**: These options start with (i) tert-butylation of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene, followed by (ii) nitration. The tert-butyl group is an ortho/para director, but due to its large steric bulk, nitration overwhelmingly occurs at the para position, yielding 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene. Starting with this isomer makes it very difficult to achieve the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern. For a \"high-yield\" synthesis, we want to avoid reaction pathways that rely on the separation of a minor ortho isomer from a major para isomer. Thus, A and C are unlikely to be correct.\n\n**Option D**: This option starts with (i) nitration of benzene to form nitrobenzene, followed by (ii) reduction to aniline, and then (iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3. This sequence is problematic because the amino group (-NH2) of aniline is a Lewis base that reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a complex that deactivates the ring towards electrophilic substitution, preventing the Friedel-Crafts reaction from occurring efficiently. So, D is not a viable high-yield pathway.\n\n**Option B**: This option presents a sequence that seems the most plausible, employing a blocking group strategy. Let's analyze the sequence, assuming there might be typos in the later steps, but focusing on the overall strategy.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   `C6H6 + (CH3)3CCl --(AlCl3)--> C6H5-C(CH3)3`\n*   **ii) SO3/H2SO4**: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The para position is sterically most accessible, so this step blocks the para position, yielding **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   `C6H5-tBu + SO3/H2SO4 --> p-tBu-C6H4-SO3H`\n*   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Now, the para position is blocked. The -tBu group is an o,p-director, and the -SO3H group is a m-director. Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (-NO2) to the position ortho to the -tBu group and meta to the -SO3H group.\n    *   `p-tBu-C6H4-SO3H + HNO3/H2SO4 --> 4-tBu-2-NO2-C6H3-SO3H`\n    *   This step successfully installs the tert-butyl and nitro groups ortho to each other, which is a key feature of the target molecule.\n\nAt this point, the sequence in Option B becomes questionable (e.g., step vi, another nitration, seems out of place). However, the initial steps (i-iii) represent the most logical and high-yield approach to constructing the required substitution pattern among all the choices. Let's reconstruct the most logical continuation using the remaining reagents from the list to see if a valid path exists.\n\nFrom **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**, the goal is to replace the -SO3H group with an -OEt group. This cannot be done directly. A common method is to convert a temporary functional group into the desired one. Let's use the nitro group we just added as a precursor to an amine, which can then be converted to a hydroxyl group, and finally the ether.\n\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl**: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl**: The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n*   The logical next step is to convert the diazonium salt to a phenol. This is done by heating in water.\n    *   **vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group, yielding **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   Now, the blocking group needs to be removed.\n    *   **viii) dilute H2SO4**: Heating with dilute acid reverses the sulfonation (desulfonation), removing the -SO3H group to yield **2-tert-butylphenol**.\n*   The phenol is converted to the desired ethoxy ether.\n    *   **ix) NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis on the phenol gives **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   The final step is to introduce the nitro group at the C3 position.\n    *   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene. The strong activating -OEt group directs ortho/para (to C4 and C6), while the weaker -tBu group directs ortho/para (to C3 and C5). While the regiochemistry of this step is complex and may not be exclusively at C3 under all conditions, it is the final transformation required to get the target molecule.\n\nThis complete, logical sequence (i -> ii -> iii -> iv -> v -> vii -> viii -> ix -> vi) utilizes all the reagents listed in option B. Option B correctly identifies the crucial first three steps (t-butylation -> sulfonation -> ortho-nitration) which set up the correct regiochemistry. No other option provides a viable start to a high-yield synthesis. The scrambled order of the later steps in the provided option text is likely a typo. Based on the correct initial strategy, Option B is the best choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
