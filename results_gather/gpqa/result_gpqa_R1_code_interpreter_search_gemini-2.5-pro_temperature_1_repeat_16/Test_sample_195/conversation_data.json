    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Energy Conservation:** The total energy of the oscillating mass is conserved. The total mechanical energy ($E$) is the sum of its kinetic energy ($KE$) and its potential energy ($PE$).\n    $E = KE + PE = \\text{constant}$\n\n2.  **Potential Energy:** The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy stored in the spring when it is displaced by a distance $x$ from its equilibrium position is:\n    $PE = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Relativistic Kinetic Energy:** For a particle of rest mass $m$ moving at a speed $v$, the relativistic kinetic energy is given by:\n    $KE = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$\n    where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n4.  **Analyze the motion at key points:** We can use the conservation of energy by comparing the total energy at two specific points in the oscillation:\n    *   **At the maximum amplitude (turning point):** The mass is momentarily at rest.\n        Position: $x = A$\n        Speed: $v = 0$\n        At this point, the kinetic energy is zero ($v=0 \\implies \\gamma=1 \\implies KE=0$), and the potential energy is maximum.\n        $E = KE + PE = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position:** The mass is moving at its maximum speed.\n        Position: $x = 0$\n        Speed: $v = v_{max}$\n        At this point, the potential energy is zero ($PE = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$), and the kinetic energy is maximum.\n        The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        $E = KE + PE = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n5.  **Equate the total energy expressions:** Since energy is conserved, the total energy at the turning point must be equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n6.  **Solve for $v_{max}$:** Now, we need to solve this equation for $v_{max}$.\n    *   First, rearrange the equation to isolate $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n        $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    *   Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    *   Invert both sides of the equation:\n        $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    *   Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    *   Rearrange to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    *   Finally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:** The derived expression for $v_{max}$ matches option C exactly.\n\n    *   A) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$ (Incorrect)\n    *   B) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ (This is the classical, non-relativistic result)\n    *   C) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$ (Correct)\n    *   D) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$ (Dimensionally incorrect)\n\n<<<C>>>"
