    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, consistent with the value for a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated compounds, which is consistent with this information.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The spectrum shows two particularly complex signals:\n    1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nTo identify the compound, we need to find a structure that can produce both of these specific splitting patterns. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent non-equivalent protons (n) according to the n+1 rule. For complex splitting, a proton is coupled to multiple different sets of neighboring protons.\n\n*   A **dtq** arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a set of 1 proton (giving a doublet), a set of 2 protons (giving a triplet), and a set of 3 protons (giving a quartet). The neighbor counts are **{1H, 2H, 3H}**.\n*   A **dtt** arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a set of 1 proton (giving a doublet), a set of 2 protons (giving a triplet), and another set of 2 protons (giving another triplet). The neighbor counts are **{1H, 2H, 2H}**.\n\n**3. Analysis of Each Candidate Structure**\n\nFor this analysis, we will analyze the expected splitting for each methine (CH) proton. We will make a common simplifying assumption that protons on a CH₂ group adjacent to a chiral center are \"accidentally equivalent\" and thus split signals into a simple triplet. Without this assumption, the patterns would be much more complex (e.g., doublet of doublets) and would not match the given names (dtq, dtt).\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `(CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH₂(d)-COOH`\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H(c)**. Its neighbors are: H(b) (1H), the CH₂(d) group (2H), and the adjacent CH₃ group (3H).\n    *   Neighbor counts for H(c): **{1H, 2H, 3H}**. This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, no other proton in this molecule has the neighbor counts {1H, 2H, 2H} required to produce a dtt. Thus, molecule A is unlikely.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `(CH₃CH₂)-CH(c)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₂CH₃)-COOH`\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H(c)**. Its neighbors are: H(b) (1H), the CH₂ group of the main chain ethyl (2H), and the CH₂ group of the side-chain ethyl (2H).\n    *   Neighbor counts for H(c): **{1H, 2H, 2H}**. This would produce a **dtt** signal.\n    *   However, no other proton in this molecule has the neighbor counts {1H, 2H, 3H} required to produce a dtq. Thus, molecule B is unlikely.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,5-diethylhexanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `(CH₃)-CH(b)(C₂H₅)-CH₂-CH(d)(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`\n    *   Proton H(b) neighbors: {CH₃(3H), main-chain CH₂(2H), ethyl CH₂(2H)}. This gives a qtt (quartet of triplets of triplets).\n    *   Proton H(d) neighbors: {main-chain CH₂(2H), alpha-CH₂(2H), ethyl CH₂(2H)}. This gives a ttt (triplet of triplets of triplets).\n    *   This molecule produces neither a dtq nor a dtt.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `(CH₃CH₂)(b)-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(f)(CH₃)-COOH`\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H(c)**. Its neighbors are: the CH₂(b) group (2H), proton H(f) (1H), and the adjacent CH₃ group (3H).\n    *   Neighbor counts for H(c): **{2H, 1H, 3H}**. This would produce a **tqd** (triplet of quartets of doublets) or **dtq**, depending on the relative coupling constants. This matches the first required signal.\n    *   Now let's search for the **dtt** {1H, 2H, 2H}. A simple analysis of the other protons (H(f), CH₂(b)) does not reveal a dtt pattern.\n\n**Revisiting the Problem and Conclusion**\n\nA rigorous analysis shows that none of the molecules perfectly produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. This suggests a potential typo in the problem description. However, we must choose the best fit. Let's reconsider the possibility. The problem description is highly specific. It is very likely that one of the structures does in fact produce these signals, possibly through a combination of factors like conformation and coupling constants that are not immediately obvious from a simplified analysis.\n\nLet's re-examine molecule C, which is a strong candidate for the `dtq`.\n`CH₃(a)-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(CH₃d)-CH(f)(CH₃e)-COOH`\n- H(c) is coupled to H(f) (1H), CH₂(b) (2H), and CH₃(d) (3H). This is a solid candidate for the **dtq**.\n- Let's reconsider the protons on CH₂(b), Hb' and Hb''. They are diastereotopic. Each is coupled to the three protons of CH₃(a), the single proton H(c), and each other (one proton). This gives a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq).\n\nThere appears to be a contradiction in the problem statement vs. standard analysis. However, if we assume there is an intended answer, we must find the best fit. Let's reconsider the options. Molecule C clearly has a proton (H(c)) with the required neighbors {1H, 2H, 3H} to give a dtq. While the dtt is not obvious, it's possible that complex conformational effects on the CH₂(b) protons could lead to this pattern, or that there is a typo in the question where \"dtt\" should have been another pattern present in C, like \"dq\" (from H(f)). Given that C provides a perfect match for the most complex signal (the dtq), it remains the most plausible candidate.\n\nLet's assume the question is correct. If we carefully re-examine structure C, the proton H(c) is coupled to H(f) (1H), CH3(d) (3H), and CH2(b) (2H), giving the dtq. The other complex signal, the dtt, must come from one of the CH2(b) protons. For one of these protons to be a dtt, it needs neighbours of {1H, 2H, 2H}. It is coupled to its geminal partner (1H) and H(c) (1H) and the CH3(a) group (3H). It seems there is an error in the question, but C is the only compound that contains a proton with neighbours {1H, 2H, 3H} which gives a dtq, and another proton on the alpha-carbon with neighbours {1H, 3H} which gives a dq. Comparing dtq and dq to dtq and dtt, it seems the most plausible option.\n\nFinal decision leans towards C as it's the only one providing a clear origin for the highly specific `dtq` signal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
