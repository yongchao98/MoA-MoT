    "An organic moiety shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a stereocenter (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or the presence of axial chirality (due to restricted rotation about a bond). A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a biphenyl derivative. The bond between the two phenyl rings is a single bond.\n    *   The positions ortho to this single bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃) and two nitro groups (-NO₂).\n    *   These bulky groups sterically hinder the free rotation around the C-C single bond connecting the two phenyl rings.\n    *   This restricted rotation forces the two rings to be non-coplanar.\n    *   Because the substitution pattern on each ring is unsymmetrical (e.g., on one ring, a -COOCH₃ at C2 and a -NO₂ at C6), the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism, which is a form of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-C(=O)OCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter).\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n    *   The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized and is bonded to only three groups (two phenyl rings and one oxygen atom). It cannot be a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the trans-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar.\n    *   It possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   Due to the presence of a center of inversion, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds **1** and **2** are the only ones that show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
