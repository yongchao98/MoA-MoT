    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M_total_1) to the total mass of system_2 (M_total_2). This can be expressed as the factor M_total_1 / M_total_2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars (K1 and K2). The formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is:\n    M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n    where:\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to the line of sight.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Given Information:**\n    *   The problem states that both systems are **eclipsing**. This is a critical piece of information. For eclipses to occur, our line of sight must be very close to the plane of the orbit. This means the inclination angle `i` is close to 90°.\n    *   When `i` ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. We can assume this is true for both systems.\n\n4.  **Set up the Mass Ratio:** We want to calculate the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2.\n    *   For system_1: M_total_1 = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i₁))\n    *   For system_2: M_total_2 = (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i₂))\n\n    The ratio is:\n    Ratio = M_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i₁)) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i₂)) ]\n\n5.  **Simplify the Ratio:**\n    *   The constant term `(2 * π * G)` appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out.\n    *   Since both systems are eclipsing, we assume `sin³(i₁) ≈ sin³(i₂) ≈ 1`, so these terms also cancel out.\n    *   The simplified ratio becomes:\n        Ratio = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³)\n\n6.  **Substitute the Numerical Values:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   P1 = 2 years\n        *   K1_total = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   P2 = 1 year\n        *   K2_total = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n    Note: Since we are calculating a ratio, we don't need to convert the units to SI (e.g., years to seconds, km/s to m/s) as long as the units are consistent for both systems.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Ratio = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³\n    Ratio = 2 * (3/5)³\n    Ratio = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    Ratio = 54 / 125\n    Ratio = 0.432\n\nTo verify the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\n# Parameters for System 1\nP1 = 2.0  # Period in years\nK1a = 10.0 # Velocity amplitude in km/s\nK1b = 5.0  # Velocity amplitude in km/s\n\n# Parameters for System 2\nP2 = 1.0  # Period in years\nK2a = 15.0 # Velocity amplitude in km/s\nK2b = 10.0 # Velocity amplitude in km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system\nK_total_1 = K1a + K1b\nK_total_2 = K2a + K2b\n\n# The ratio of the total masses is proportional to P * (K_total)^3\n# Ratio = (P1 * K_total_1^3) / (P2 * K_total_2^3)\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K_total_1 / K_total_2)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated ratio is 0.432.

    "Here's the step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2. That is, we need to calculate `M_total_1 / M_total_2`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 1 (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 2 (K1b) = 5 km/s\n        *   It's an eclipsing system.\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 1 (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 2 (K2b) = 10 km/s\n        *   It's an eclipsing system.\n\n3.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass (the sum of the two stellar masses, `m1 + m2`) can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2). The formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is:\n    `m1 + m2 = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n    where:\n    *   `m1 + m2` is the total mass of the system.\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `K1` and `K2` are the velocity amplitudes.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit with respect to the plane of the sky.\n\n4.  **Use the \"Eclipsing\" Information:** The problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing.\" This is a crucial piece of information. For eclipses to occur, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane of the stars. This means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90 degrees.\n    *   If `i ≈ 90°`, then `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n    *   Therefore, `sin³(i) ≈ 1³ = 1`.\n    *   We can safely assume `sin³(i) = 1` for both systems, which simplifies the mass formula.\n\n5.  **Set Up the Mass Ratio:** We need to find the ratio `M_total_1 / M_total_2`.\n    *   `M_total_1 = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G)`\n    *   `M_total_2 = (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G)`\n\n    Now, let's form the ratio:\n    `Ratio = M_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G) ]`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Ratio Expression:** The constants `2 * π * G` appear in both the numerator and the denominator, so they cancel out. The simplified expression for the ratio is:\n    `Ratio = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³)`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `Ratio = (P1 / P2) * ( (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) )³`\n\n7.  **Substitute the Numerical Values:**\n    *   `P1 = 2` years\n    *   `P2 = 1` year\n    *   `K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n    *   `K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n\n    `Ratio = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³`\n\n8.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   `Ratio = 2 * (3 / 5)³`\n    *   `Ratio = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    *   `Ratio = 54 / 125`\n    *   `Ratio = 0.432`\n\n9.  **Compare with the Options:** The calculated value is 0.432.\n    *   A) ~ 0.7\n    *   B) ~ 0.4\n    *   C) ~ 1.2\n    *   D) ~ 0.6\n    The value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\nThe Python code I executed previously confirmed this calculation, yielding `0.431999...`, which is the floating-point representation of `0.432`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
