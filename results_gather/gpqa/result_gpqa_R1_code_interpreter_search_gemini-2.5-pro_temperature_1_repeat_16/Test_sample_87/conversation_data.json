    "*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the experimental setup and observations.**\n    *   **Antigen Delivery:** GFP-tagged rotavirus inner capsid proteins are delivered orally. This mimics a natural route of infection for a gut pathogen.\n    *   **Location of Response:** Fluorescence is found in Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are secondary lymphoid organs located in the small intestine, crucial for initiating immune responses against gut antigens. This is where the action is happening.\n    *   **Cellular Activity:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated. Proliferation (rapid cell division) is a key feature of an adaptive immune response, specifically the clonal expansion of lymphocytes (B cells or T cells) that recognize the antigen.\n    *   **Genetic Analysis:** The \"variable heavy chain gene\" of these cells is sequenced. The heavy chain is a component of the B cell receptor (BCR) and antibodies. This tells us the proliferating cells are B cells.\n    *   **Key Finding:** \"High variability\" is observed in this specific gene region. This means that among the proliferating B cells, the DNA sequence of the variable heavy chain is not identical but shows many differences, particularly point mutations.\n\n*   **Step 2: Evaluate the provided options in the context of the observations.**\n    *   **A) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ) *before* a B cell ever encounters an antigen. The experiment describes a response happening in a secondary lymphoid organ *after* antigen exposure. While the cells originated from this process, VDJ recombination is not the cause of the *new* variability arising *during* the proliferation in the Peyer's patch.\n    *   **B) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate and adaptive humoral immune system involving a cascade of serum proteins. It does not involve genetic changes in B cells. Therefore, it cannot explain the observed genetic variability in the heavy chain gene.\n    *   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a biological process that occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). During proliferation, the enzyme Activation-Induced Deaminase (AID) introduces point mutations into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (including the heavy chain). This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different receptors. Those with higher affinity for the antigen are then selected to survive. This process directly and perfectly explains the \"high variability\" observed in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of the \"proliferating cell population\" in the Peyer's patch.\n    *   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. It changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, which determines the antibody's isotype (e.g., switching from IgM to IgA, which is important for mucosal immunity). It does *not* alter the *variable* region, which is responsible for antigen binding. The observation is high variability in the *variable* heavy chain gene, so while class switching is likely happening in parallel, it is not the process responsible for this specific observation.\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclude based on the analysis.**\n    The scenario describes a classic germinal center reaction in a Peyer's patch in response to an oral antigen. The key features are the proliferation of B cells and the generation of high sequence diversity in the variable region of their antibody genes. This process of introducing point mutations to fine-tune antibody affinity is called somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
