    "Here's a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Given:** The number of stars, let's call it `N`, varies with parallax (`plx`) as `N ∝ 1/plx^5`. This means `N = k * (1/plx^5)` for some constant `k`.\n    *   **Goal:** Find how the number of stars *per unit range of distance* changes with distance (`r`). This is asking for the relationship for `dN/dr`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Physical Relationship:**\n    *   The fundamental relationship needed here is the one between parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`).\n    *   Parallax is defined as the apparent shift of a star against the background as the Earth orbits the Sun. It is inversely proportional to the distance to the star.\n    *   The formula is `plx = 1/r` (where `plx` is in arcseconds and `r` is in parsecs). This can be written as `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n\n3.  **Translate the Given Information from Parallax to Distance:**\n    *   We are given `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   We know `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n    *   Substitute the relationship for `plx` into the equation for `N`.\n    *   `N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    *   `N ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)`\n    *   `N ∝ r^5`\n\n4.  **Interpret the meaning of `N ∝ r^5`:**\n    *   This expression `N` represents the *total cumulative number of stars* observed out to a distance `r`. It's not the number of stars *at* a specific distance `r`, but all the stars from distance 0 up to `r`.\n\n5.  **Determine what the Question is Asking For:**\n    *   The question asks for \"how the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\".\n    *   This is asking for the number of stars within a small range of distance, `dr`. This quantity is the number density with respect to the radial coordinate, which is mathematically represented by the derivative `dN/dr`.\n    *   Think of it like this: If `N(r)` is the total number of people shorter than height `r`, then `dN/dr` tells you how many people have a height *around* `r`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Derivative:**\n    *   We have the proportionality `N ∝ r^5`. Let's write this as an equation with a constant of proportionality, `C`: `N = C * r^5`.\n    *   Now, we need to find the derivative of `N` with respect to `r`.\n    *   `dN/dr = d/dr (C * r^5)`\n    *   Using the power rule for differentiation (`d/dx (x^n) = n*x^(n-1)`):\n    *   `dN/dr = C * 5 * r^(5-1)`\n    *   `dN/dr = 5C * r^4`\n\n7.  **State the Final Proportionality:**\n    *   Since `5C` is just another constant, we can say that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`.\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n8.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   A) ~ r^4\n    *   B) ~ r^3\n    *   C) ~ r^5\n    *   D) ~ r^2\n    *   The result `~ r^4` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
