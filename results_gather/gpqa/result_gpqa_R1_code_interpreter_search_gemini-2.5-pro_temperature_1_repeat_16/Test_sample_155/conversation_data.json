    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a C2 axis of symmetry.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2     H\n                 \\   /\n                  C=C\n                 /   \\\n                H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n3.  **Intermediate Epoxide:** When a *trans*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition, it forms a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides. The mCPBA can attack from the top face or the bottom face of the alkene with equal probability.\n    *   Attack from top -> (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane\n    *   Attack from bottom -> (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane\n    The result is a racemic mixture of the *trans*-epoxide.\n4.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent is used for the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by a backside (Sₙ2-like) attack by a water molecule. This is an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl groups overall.\n5.  **Final Product of Reaction 1:** We are performing an *anti*-opening on a racemic mixture of a *trans*-epoxide.\n    *   Starting with (4R,5R)-epoxide, the backside attack of water at C4 (or C5) will cause an inversion of configuration at that carbon. For example, attack at C4 leads to (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Starting with (4S,5S)-epoxide, the backside attack of water at C4 (or C5) leads to (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    The two products, (4S,5R)- and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are actually the same molecule. This molecule has two chiral centers but also has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a *meso* compound.\n    *   **Shortcut:** A common rule in stereochemistry states that *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a *meso* product (if the substituents are the same, as they are here).\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is a single compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule, possessing a plane of symmetry.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2     CH2CH2CH3\n                 \\   /\n                  C=C\n                 /   \\\n                H     H\n    ```\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** Again, this is a *syn*-addition epoxidation.\n3.  **Intermediate Epoxide:** When a *cis*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition, it forms a *meso* epoxide. The resulting *cis*-epoxide has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral.\n4.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is the same *anti*-opening as in Reaction 1.\n5.  **Final Product of Reaction 2:** We are performing an *anti*-opening on a *meso*-epoxide.\n    *   The acid protonates the oxygen. Then, water can attack either of the two epoxide carbons from the backside.\n    *   Let's say the meso epoxide has (4R,5S) configuration.\n    *   Attack at C4 (the R center) causes inversion to S, leaving C5 unchanged. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at C5 (the S center) causes inversion to R, leaving C4 unchanged. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the reaction produces a 50:50 mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are a pair of enantiomers. The 50:50 mixture is a **racemic mixture**.\n    *   **Shortcut:** *Anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the relationships:\n*   (2) and (3) are **enantiomers**.\n*   (1) is a **diastereomer** of both (2) and (3).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n    *   In our mixture, the meso-diol (1) is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair (2 and 3). Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the pair. The enantiomers (2 and 3) will co-elute.\n    *   This will result in **2 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   A chiral column can separate **enantiomers** because they will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   It can also separate **diastereomers**.\n    *   Since the column can resolve all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture, and we are told the resolution is as high as theoretically possible, each stereoisomer will produce its own peak.\n    *   This will result in **3 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
