    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Process\nThe problem asks about a two-step electric dipole (E1) transition in a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |n, l, m\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$ (also known as the 3s state).\n*   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |n, l, m\\rangle = |1, 0, 0\\rangle$ (the ground state, or 1s state).\n*   **Process:** The transition occurs in two steps through an intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. Apply Selection Rules for E1 Transitions\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer.\n\n### 3. Identify Possible Intermediate States\nLet's analyze the first transition: $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n*   Initial state has $l=0, m=0$.\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $\\Delta l = +1$, which means $l'=1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n*   The principal quantum number $n'$ can be any integer other than 3. The options provided in the question all specify the intermediate state to have $n'=2$. So we consider the intermediate states to be the $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p sublevels).\n\nSo, the possible intermediate states are:\n*   $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$\n*   $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$\n*   $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$\n\nNow let's check the second transition: $|2, 1, m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n*   Initial state for this step has $l'=1$. Final state has $l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$. This requires $m'$ to be in $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, which is true for all our possible intermediate states.\n*   Thus, all three states $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$ are valid intermediate states for the cascade.\n\nThe possible transition routes are:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 4. Calculate the Probabilities of the Routes\nThe probability of a specific route is determined by the branching ratio. The total process is the decay of the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state. Assuming the decay happens exclusively through the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, we need to find the relative probabilities of entering each of the three channels.\n\nThe probability of a specific route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is given by the product of the probabilities of each step:\n$P(\\text{route } m') = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n\n**Step 1: Probability of the first transition**\nThe probability (or branching ratio) of the transition to a specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is proportional to the transition rate, which in turn is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) \\propto W(3s \\to 2p, m') \\propto |\\langle 2,1,m' | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (unpolarized). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the degenerate sublevels $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. The transition rates must be equal:\n$W(3s \\to 2p, m'=-1) = W(3s \\to 2p, m'=0) = W(3s \\to 2p, m'=1)$\n\nA formal calculation confirms this. The squared matrix element $|\\langle n'l'm'|\\vec{r}|nl0\\rangle|^2$ for $l=0$ is independent of $m'$. Let's denote the rate for each transition as $W_1$.\nThe total transition rate to the $2p$ level is $W_{total} = W(m'=-1) + W(m'=0) + W(m'=1) = 3W_1$.\nThe branching ratio for the transition into a specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n$B(m') = \\frac{W(m')}{W_{total}} = \\frac{W_1}{3W_1} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nSo, $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) = 1/3$ for each $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Probability of the second transition**\nOnce the atom is in one of the intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, it will decay. The only decay channel allowed by the E1 selection rules to a lower energy level is the transition to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. (Decay to $|2,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden). Therefore, the probability of the second step, given the atom is in the intermediate state, is 1.\n$P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n**Total Probability for a Route**\nThe total probability for any specific route is:\n$P(\\text{route } m') = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThis means:\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\nThe options are:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\nOur calculated probability for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is $1/3$. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
