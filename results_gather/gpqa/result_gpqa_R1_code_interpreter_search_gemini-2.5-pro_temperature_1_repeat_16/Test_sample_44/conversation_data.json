    "This problem requires us to determine the energies of the ground state and the first two excited states for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFor a single particle of mass 'm' in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are given by:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere n = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe problem defines a unit of energy $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. So, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n$E_n = n^2 E$\n\nThe first few single-particle energy levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n**2. Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are described as \"identical spin-1/2 particles\". Particles with half-integer spin are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the exact same quantum state. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by its spatial quantum number (n) and its spin quantum number ($m_s$). For a spin-1/2 particle, $m_s$ can be +1/2 (spin-up) or -1/2 (spin-down).\n\nThis means that each spatial energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two fermions: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n**3. Ground State Energy ($E_{GS}$)**\n\nTo find the ground state energy of the four-particle system, we fill the lowest available single-particle energy levels, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1 ($E_1=E$):** We place the first two fermions in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Level n=2 ($E_2=4E$):** We place the remaining two fermions in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n$E_{GS} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2)$\n$E_{GS} = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$)**\n\nThe first excited state is the lowest-energy configuration that is not the ground state. We can achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   Ground state configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   Highest occupied level: n=2.\n*   Lowest unoccupied level: n=3.\n\nWe move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level. The new configuration is:\n*   2 particles in level n=1.\n*   1 particle in level n=2.\n*   1 particle in level n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We must consider all possible excitations from the ground state and identify the second-lowest excitation energy.\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (from promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3).\n\nLet's consider other possible excitations from the ground state {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2}:\n\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from a lower level, n=1, to the lowest available level, n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3 (a double excitation).\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4.\n    *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the second excited state energy is $E_{2nd} = 18E$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
