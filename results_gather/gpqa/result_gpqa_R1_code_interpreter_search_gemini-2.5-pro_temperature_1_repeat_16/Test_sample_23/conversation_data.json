    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, a product of hydrogenation, and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (an alkane or a cycloalkane).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's determine the empirical formula.\n    *   14.28% is very close to 14.2857%, which is the fraction 1/7.\n    *   Mass % of H = (mass of H) / (total mass) = 1/7.\n    *   This implies (mass of H) / (mass of C) = 1/6.\n    *   Let the formula be CxHy. Using atomic masses C≈12 and H≈1, we get (y * 1) / (x * 12) = 1/6.\n    *   This simplifies to 6y = 12x, or y = 2x.\n    *   The formula for Z is (CH2)n, or CnH2n. This is the general formula for a cycloalkane. Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, it must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12). Both fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (CnH2n).\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say C = Z = CnH2n (the cycloalkane).\n    *   The other component, D, must also hydrogenate to Z. Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it must be an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton. The most common and stable aromatic compounds are based on a benzene ring (n=6).\n    *   Let's hypothesize that n=6. Then Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). The corresponding aromatic compound D would be benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Let's check if this fits: Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)}.\n        *   Cyclohexane is saturated. Benzene only reacts with Br2 in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, not with bromine water. So, Y does not decolorize bromine water. (This fits).\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y: Cyclohexane doesn't react. Benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12). So, hydrogenation gives only one substance, Z=cyclohexane. (This fits).\n        *   The n=6 hypothesis seems very strong.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (cyclohexane, C6H12). This means both A and B must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n    *   Molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation: X -> Y. Since X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the reaction is likely A + B -> C + D.\n    *   Substituting the identities of C and D (from our n=6 hypothesis): A + B -> C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   This reaction represents a transfer of hydrogen atoms. By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H in C6H12) + (H in C6H6) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must be 18. H(A) + H(B) = 18.\n\n4.  **Identify Substances A and B**\n    *   We need to find two compounds, A and B, that satisfy these conditions:\n        *   Have a 6-carbon ring skeleton.\n        *   Are unsaturated.\n        *   Are not conjugated.\n        *   H(A) + H(B) = 18.\n    *   The possible non-conjugated unsaturated C6-ring compounds are:\n        *   Cyclohexene: C6H10\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene: C6H8\n        *   (1,3-Cyclohexadiene is conjugated, so it's ruled out).\n    *   Let's check the sum of hydrogens for this pair:\n        *   H(cyclohexene) + H(1,4-cyclohexadiene) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   This combination perfectly fits the hydrogen requirement. So, mixture X consists of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction is:\n        C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n        In this reaction, cyclohexene is reduced (gains 2H) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized (loses 2H). This is a plausible catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n\n5.  **Answer the Question**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   The two liquids are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
