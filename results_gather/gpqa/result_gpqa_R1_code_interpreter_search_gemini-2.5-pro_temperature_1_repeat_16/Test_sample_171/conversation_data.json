    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical law.** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in stellar photospheres, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The distribution of particles among energy levels in such a system is governed by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation.** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state `j` (N_j) to the number of atoms in a lower state `i` (N_i) is given by:\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))\n    Where:\n    *   g_j and g_i are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   E_j - E_i is the energy difference between the levels, which we'll call ΔE.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Translate the problem's conditions into mathematical expressions.**\n    *   Let the excited state be `j` and the ground state be `i`.\n    *   The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of the population of the excited state to the ground state in star 1 is twice that in star 2.\n    *   Let's denote this ratio as R. So, R_1 = 2 * R_2.\n    *   For star 1 (temperature T_1): R_1 = (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n    *   For star 2 (temperature T_2): R_2 = (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n4.  **Set up the equation based on the given relationship (R_1 = 2 * R_2).**\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n\n5.  **Simplify the equation.** The statistical weight factor (g_j / g_i) is the same for both stars and cancels out:\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n6.  **Solve for the relationship between T_1 and T_2.** To deal with the exponents, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n    Using the logarithm rule ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b):\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n7.  **Rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2).**\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\n8.  **Factor out the common term (ΔE / k).**\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n9.  **Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis.**\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n10. **Use the given numerical values.** The problem provides:\n    *   Energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J.\n    *   The Boltzmann constant k is a fundamental constant with the value k ≈ 1.380649 × 10^(-23) J/K.\n    *   The ratio (ΔE / k) is therefore:\n        (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.380649 × 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 1 K.\n    *   The problem is designed such that this pre-factor is essentially 1.\n\n11. **Write the final equation.** Substituting (ΔE / k) ≈ 1 into our derived equation:\n    1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n12. **Compare with the given options.** This result matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
