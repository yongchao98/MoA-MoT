    "*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound containing the most abundant isotope of each element.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative abundance of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl ≈ 75.8% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 24.2%). The peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecule with ³⁵Cl, and the peak at m/z = 158 corresponds to the molecule with ³⁷Cl.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. Its position is consistent with that of a carboxylic acid, which is typically found in the 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ range.\n    *   Combining these two peaks strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield, typically above 10 ppm, is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The integration (1H) confirms it's a single proton, and its singlet nature is expected as it does not couple with other protons.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent. They split each other into doublets.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Has a molecular weight of 156.5 g/mol. However, it is an aldehyde and a phenol. It lacks a carboxylic acid group, which contradicts the IR and NMR data (no -COOH proton at 11.0 ppm). The aromatic region would show three distinct protons, not two doublets of 2H.\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Has a molecular weight of 156.5 g/mol and is a carboxylic acid. However, being ortho-substituted, its four aromatic protons would be non-equivalent and produce a more complex splitting pattern, not two doublets of 2H each.\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** Has the correct molecular weight (C₇H₅ClO₂ gives 156.5 g/mol for the ³⁵Cl isotope). It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR and the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm. It is a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring, which perfectly explains the NMR pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, in the aromatic region. This structure is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n    *   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** Has the correct molecular weight but is an ester. It lacks the O-H group, so it would not show the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹, nor would it have the carboxylic acid proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the NMR.\n\n**Conclusion:** All evidence points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
