    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle, so its spin angular momentum is described by the spin operators `S_x`, `S_y`, and `S_z`.\n*   Its magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, the particle is in a magnetic field `B` pointing in the `+Z` direction. The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -μ · B = -γB S_z`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned with the magnetic field\". This means it is in the lowest possible energy state. The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin up) and `-ħ/2` (spin down). The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = +γB(ħ/2)`. The lowest energy state is the spin-up state, which we denote as `|+z⟩`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the system at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n### 2. The New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n\n*   At `t=0`, the Z-direction field is turned off, and a new magnetic field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the `+Y` direction.\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the system for `t > 0` is `H = -μ · B = -γB S_y`.\n*   The state of the system will evolve according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)`.\n*   Substituting the new Hamiltonian, the time evolution operator is `U(t) = exp(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) = exp(iγBS_yt/ħ)`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment\n\nWe want to find the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z⟩(t)`.\n`⟨μ_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = γ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n\nLet's calculate `⟨S_z⟩(t)`. There are several ways to do this. One of the most insightful is to work in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian.\n\n*   **Step 3a: Decompose the initial state into the new energy eigenstates.**\n    The new Hamiltonian is `H = -γBS_y`. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `S_y`, which we'll call `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`.\n    *   `|+y⟩` has `S_y` eigenvalue `+ħ/2`, so its energy is `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   `|-y⟩` has `S_y` eigenvalue `-ħ/2`, so its energy is `E_- = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    In the standard `S_z` basis (`|+z⟩ = (1, 0)`, `|-z⟩ = (0, 1)`), the `S_y` eigenstates are:\n    `|+y⟩ = (1/√2)(|+z⟩ + i|-z⟩)`\n    `|-y⟩ = (1/√2)(|+z⟩ - i|-z⟩)`\n    We need to write our initial state `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩` in this new basis. By inverting the relations above, we find:\n    `|+z⟩ = (1/√2)(|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)`.\n    So, at `t=0`, the state is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.\n\n*   **Step 3b: Evolve the state in time.**\n    Each energy eigenstate evolves with its corresponding phase factor `exp(-iEt/ħ)`.\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2)exp(-iE_+t/ħ)|+y⟩ + (1/√2)exp(-iE_-t/ħ)|-y⟩`\n    Substituting the energy values:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2)exp(-i(-γBħ/2)t/ħ)|+y⟩ + (1/√2)exp(-i(γBħ/2)t/ħ)|-y⟩`\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2)exp(iγBt/2)|+y⟩ + (1/√2)exp(-iγBt/2)|-y⟩`\n\n*   **Step 3c: Calculate the expectation value `⟨S_z⟩(t)`.**\n    We need to evaluate `⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`. For this, we need to know how the `S_z` operator acts on the `S_y` eigenstates. It can be shown that `S_z` swaps them:\n    `S_z|+y⟩ = (ħ/2)|-y⟩`\n    `S_z|-y⟩ = (ħ/2)|+y⟩`\n    Now we compute the expectation value:\n    `⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`\n    `S_z|ψ(t)⟩ = S_z [ (1/√2)exp(iγBt/2)|+y⟩ + (1/√2)exp(-iγBt/2)|-y⟩ ]`\n    `S_z|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2)exp(iγBt/2)(ħ/2)|-y⟩ + (1/√2)exp(-iγBt/2)(ħ/2)|+y⟩`\n    Now, take the inner product with `⟨ψ(t)| = (1/√2)exp(-iγBt/2)⟨+y| + (1/√2)exp(iγBt/2)⟨-y|`:\n    `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (1/2) [ exp(-iγBt/2)⟨+y| + exp(iγBt/2)⟨-y| ] · [ exp(-iγBt/2)(ħ/2)|+y⟩ + exp(iγBt/2)(ħ/2)|-y⟩ ]`\n    Using the orthogonality `⟨+y|-y⟩ = 0` and `⟨-y|+y⟩ = 0`:\n    `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (1/2) [ exp(-iγBt/2) * exp(-iγBt/2)(ħ/2)⟨+y|+y⟩ + exp(iγBt/2) * exp(iγBt/2)(ħ/2)⟨-y|-y⟩ ]`\n    `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/4) [ exp(-iγBt) + exp(iγBt) ]`\n    Using Euler's identity `cos(x) = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))/2`:\n    `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/4) [ 2cos(γBt) ] = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\n### 4. Determining the Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe average z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨S_z⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThis expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation. A general oscillation is of the form `A cos(ωt + φ)`. By comparing this with our result, we can identify the angular frequency `ω`.\nThe angular frequency of oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin vector, initially pointing along the Z-axis, precesses around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis) at the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`. Its projection onto the Z-axis oscillates at this same frequency.\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency, which, given the context and the options, refers to the angular frequency `ω`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
