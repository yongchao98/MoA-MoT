    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given a vector field `f` that is radial and has a magnitude that falls off as `1/r^2`. This can be written in spherical coordinates as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\nwhere `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nWe need to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`, over a volume `V` which is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**2. Choose a Method: The Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) is the most suitable tool for this problem. It states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume:\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n**Important Note:** The vector field `f` has a singularity at the origin (`r=0`), where its magnitude becomes infinite. Strictly speaking, the Divergence Theorem requires the field to be continuously differentiable everywhere inside the volume. However, we can still use the theorem by understanding that the singularity at the origin acts as a \"source\" of the field. The total divergence, which represents the source strength, is contained within the volume and its effect is properly measured by the flux through the enclosing surface. The calculation below is the standard method for handling such cases.\n\n**3. Set up the Surface Integral**\n\nWe need to evaluate the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   **The Vector Field on the Surface:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n\n*   **The Surface Element Vector (dS):** For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` is always pointing radially outward. Its direction is `r̂` and its magnitude in spherical coordinates is `R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. Therefore:\n    `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`\n\n**4. Calculate the Dot Product (f ⋅ dS)**\n\nNow, we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n`f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [(R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂]`\n\nSince `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n`f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ)`\n`f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nNotice that the `R^2` terms cancel out. This means the flux is independent of the radius of the sphere, a characteristic result for a `1/r^2` field.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Integral**\n\nNow we integrate `f ⋅ dS` over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫[from φ=0 to 2π] ∫[from θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nWe can solve this by integrating with respect to `θ` first:\n`∫[from θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]` (from 0 to π)\n`= (-cos(π)) - (-cos(0))`\n`= (-(-1)) - (-1)`\n`= 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nNow, we integrate this result with respect to `φ`:\n`∫[from φ=0 to 2π] 2 dφ = 2 * [φ]` (from 0 to 2π)\n`= 2 * (2π - 0)`\n`= 4π`\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this surface integral.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis result corresponds to option C.\n\n**Alternative Method (using the Dirac Delta Function)**\n\nFor those familiar with vector calculus identities, it is a known result that the divergence of this specific field is related to the three-dimensional Dirac delta function `δ³(r)`:\n`∇ ⋅ (r̂/r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`\n\nThe divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it is infinite in such a way that its integral over any volume containing the origin is `4π`.\n\nSo, the volume integral becomes:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV`\n\nSince the volume `V` (a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin) contains the origin `r=0`, the integral evaluates to:\n`∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV = 4π`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<C>>>"
