    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Physical Setup**\n\nWe have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and held at a constant potential, which we can set to zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere. We need to find the total potential energy of this entire configuration.\n\n### **2. The Method of Images**\n\nThis problem is a classic application of the \"method of images\" in electrostatics. This powerful technique allows us to replace a complex problem involving induced charges on a conductor with a simpler problem involving only point charges.\n\nThe core idea is to find a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location inside the sphere, such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius R) is zero, matching the grounded condition. For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (from the center) are given by:\n\n*   **Image charge:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R^2/d`\n\nThis equivalent system of two point charges (`q` and `q'`) correctly reproduces the electric field and potential *outside* the sphere.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. There are two common ways to calculate this.\n\n#### **Method A: Integrating the Force**\n\n1.  The force on the real charge `q` due to the grounded sphere is equivalent to the force exerted on it by the image charge `q'`.\n2.  The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b = R^2/d`) is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n3.  The force `F` on `q` is an attractive force:\n    `F = k * q * q' / (distance)^2 = k * q * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * d / (d^2 - R^2)^2`\n4.  The potential energy `U` is the work done to bring the charge from infinity to `d`, which is the integral of the external force (`-F`) required to move the charge.\n    `U = ∫[infinity to d] (-F) dx`\n    This integral can be performed, but it's more complex. A simpler method is described below.\n\n#### **Method B: Using the Potential Energy Formula**\n\n1.  The potential energy of a system of charges is given by `U = (1/2) Σ q_i * V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n2.  In our system, we have the point charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere. The potential of the sphere is `V_sphere = 0` (it's grounded).\n3.  Therefore, the total energy is just the energy associated with the point charge `q`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n    where `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n4.  By the method of images, this potential is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n5.  The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d`.\n6.  The potential at the location of `q` due to `q'` is:\n    `V_at_q = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    `V_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_at_q = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n7.  Now, we substitute this potential back into the energy formula from step 3:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option D. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the sphere is attractive, meaning that the system releases energy as the charge is brought in from infinity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
