    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and its Hamiltonian:**\n    The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means that the potential is the same in all directions, which is consistent with the potential depending only on the radial distance $r$.\n    In Cartesian coordinates, $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, so the potential is $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$.\n    The Hamiltonian for the system is separable in Cartesian coordinates:\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$, where each $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial i^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 i^2$ for $i=x, y, z$.\n    Each $H_i$ is the Hamiltonian for a one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ are non-negative integers.\n    Since the total Hamiltonian is the sum of three independent 1D oscillators, the total energy eigenvalue is the sum of the individual energy eigenvalues:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n    $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n    $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n    Let's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The energy levels are determined by the value of the principal quantum number $n$.\n    *   **Ground State:** The lowest energy state corresponds to the smallest possible value of $n$. Since $n_x, n_y, n_z$ must be non-negative integers, the smallest value for their sum is $n=0$ (when $n_x=n_y=n_z=0$). This is the ground state.\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** The next energy level corresponds to $n=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{5}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** The next energy level corresponds to $n=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{7}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** The third excited state corresponds to $n=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same total energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n = 3$. This is equivalent to the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy eigenvalue.\n\n    Let's list the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n        (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) -> 3 states\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0:\n        (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) -> 6 states\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1:\n        (1, 1, 1) -> 1 state\n\n    The total number of combinations (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th energy level for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    The degeneracy of the third excited state, which is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy, is 10.\n\n    Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\n    B) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\n    C) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\n    D) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\n\n    The correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
