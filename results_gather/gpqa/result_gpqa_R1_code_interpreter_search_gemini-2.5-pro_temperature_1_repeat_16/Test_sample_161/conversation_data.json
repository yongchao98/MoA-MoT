    "To find the area of the surface described by the given metric, we need to integrate the area element over the entire surface.\n\n**1. Identify the Metric and Area Element**\n\nThe line element is given by:\n$ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$\n\nThis is a metric on a 2D surface. The metric tensor $g_{ij}$ in Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$ can be written as:\n$g = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{xx} & g_{xy} \\\\ g_{yx} & g_{yy} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe area element $dA$ is given by the formula $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy$.\nFirst, we calculate the determinant of the metric tensor:\n$\\det(g) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2 - 0^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, we find the area element:\n$dA = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2} \\, dx \\, dy = \\frac{32}{|4-x^2-y^2|} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\nThe metric is physically meaningful only when the denominator is positive, i.e., $4-x^2-y^2 > 0$. This defines the domain of our surface, which is the open disk $x^2+y^2 < 4$. Inside this disk, the denominator $4-x^2-y^2$ is always positive, so we can drop the absolute value.\n$dA = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n**2. Set up the Area Integral**\n\nThe total area $A$ is the integral of the area element $dA$ over the domain $D = \\{(x,y) | x^2+y^2 < 4\\}$:\n$A = \\iint_{D} \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n**3. Convert to Polar Coordinates**\n\nTo evaluate this integral, it is convenient to switch to polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, where:\n$x = r\\cos\\theta$\n$y = r\\sin\\theta$\n$x^2 + y^2 = r^2$\nThe differential area element in polar coordinates is $dx \\, dy = r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$.\n\nThe domain $x^2+y^2 < 4$ translates to $r^2 < 4$, which means $0 \\le r < 2$. The angle $\\theta$ ranges from $0$ to $2\\pi$.\n\nSubstituting these into the area integral, we get:\n$A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-r^2} \\, r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$\n\n**4. Evaluate the Integral**\n\nWe can separate the integral into two parts:\n$A = \\left( \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\right) \\left( \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32r}{4-r^2} \\, dr \\right)$\n\nThe integral over $\\theta$ is straightforward:\n$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = [\\theta]_{0}^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi$\n\nThe integral over $r$ is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{32r}{4-r^2}$ becomes singular as $r \\to 2$. We must evaluate it using a limit:\n$I_r = \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32r}{4-r^2} \\, dr = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\int_{0}^{a} \\frac{32r}{4-r^2} \\, dr$\n\nWe use the substitution $u = 4-r^2$. Then $du = -2r \\, dr$, which means $r \\, dr = -\\frac{1}{2} du$.\nThe limits of integration for $u$ are:\n- When $r=0$, $u = 4-0^2 = 4$.\n- When $r=a$, $u = 4-a^2$.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n$I_r = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\int_{4}^{4-a^2} 32 \\left( \\frac{1}{u} \\right) \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} du \\right) = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\int_{4}^{4-a^2} -\\frac{16}{u} \\, du$\n$I_r = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\left[ -16 \\ln|u| \\right]_{4}^{4-a^2} = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\left( -16 \\ln(4-a^2) - (-16 \\ln(4)) \\right)$\n$I_r = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\left( -16 \\ln(4-a^2) + 16 \\ln(4) \\right)$\n\nAs $a$ approaches $2$ from below, the term $4-a^2$ approaches $0^+$. The natural logarithm $\\ln(x)$ approaches $-\\infty$ as $x \\to 0^+$.\nTherefore:\n$\\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\ln(4-a^2) = -\\infty$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $I_r$:\n$I_r = -16(-\\infty) + 16\\ln(4) = +\\infty$\n\nThe radial integral diverges to infinity.\n\n**5. Final Result**\n\nThe total area is the product of the two integrals:\n$A = 2\\pi \\times I_r = 2\\pi \\times (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\nThe area of the surface is infinite.\n\n<<<B>>>"
