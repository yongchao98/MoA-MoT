    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Model:** The problem uses the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor) for a diatomic molecule. The energy levels in this model are given by the sum of vibrational and rotational energies:\n    `E(v, J) = E_v + E_J = (v + 1/2) * ħω + B * J * (J + 1)`\n    where:\n    *   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   `J` is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n    *   `B` is the rotational constant.\n\n2.  **Identify the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   The molecule is initially in its **fundamental state**, which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to `v=0` and `J=0`.\n        `E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω`\n    *   The molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the **\"next state with the lowest possible energy\"**. In the context of rovibrational spectroscopy, photon absorption must obey selection rules. For a rovibrational transition, the selection rules are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`.\n    *   Starting from `J=0`, the only possible change is `ΔJ = +1` (since J cannot be negative). Thus, the final rotational state must be `J=1`.\n    *   The change in vibrational state is `Δv = +1`, so the final vibrational state is `v=1`.\n    *   Therefore, the final state is `(v=1, J=1)`.\n        `E_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B * 1 * (1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon (ΔE):**\n    The energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    `ΔE = E_final - E_initial`\n    `ΔE = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω]`\n    `ΔE = ħω + 2B`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Physical Quantities:**\n    To find `ΔE`, we need to calculate the rotational constant `B`.\n    *   **Rotational Constant (B):** `B = ħ² / (2I)`, where `I` is the moment of inertia.\n    *   **Moment of Inertia (I):** `I = μR²`, where `μ` is the reduced mass and `R` is the bond length.\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):** `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`.\n\n5.  **Perform the Numerical Calculations:**\n    We will use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n    *   **Given values:**\n        *   `Mx = 20 amu`\n        *   `My = 2 amu`\n        *   `R = 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n        *   `ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s`\n\n    *   **Constants:**\n        *   `amu = 1.660539 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n        *   `ħ = 1.0545718 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`\n        *   `c = 2.99792458 x 10⁸ m/s`\n\n    *   **Calculation Steps:**\n        1.

    "The user wants to find the momentum of a photon that excites a diatomic molecule from its ground state to the next allowed energy state.\n\n### **1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to calculate the momentum `p` of a photon. The momentum of a photon is related to its energy `E` by the formula `p = E/c`, where `c` is the speed of light. Therefore, the core of the problem is to find the energy `E` of the photon, which corresponds to the energy difference `ΔE` between the molecule's initial and final states.\n\n2.  **Understand the Physical Model:** The problem specifies the \"quantum rotation-vibration model\" (non-rigid rotor). The energy levels for such a molecule are described by two quantum numbers:\n    *   `v`: the vibrational quantum number (`v = 0, 1, 2, ...`)\n    *   `J`: the rotational quantum number (`J = 0, 1, 2, ...`)\n\n    The total energy of a state `(v, J)` is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n    `E(v, J) = E_vibrational + E_rotational = (v + 1/2)ħω + B*J*(J+1)`\n    where:\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`).\n    *   `ω` is the vibrational angular frequency.\n    *   `B` is the rotational constant, which depends on the molecule's structure.\n\n3.  **Determine the Transition:**\n    *   **Initial State:** The molecule starts in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the state of lowest possible energy.

Convert all units to SI (kg, m).\n    b. Calculate the reduced mass `μ`.\n    c. Calculate the moment of inertia `I`.\n    d. Calculate the rotational constant `B`.\n    e.
