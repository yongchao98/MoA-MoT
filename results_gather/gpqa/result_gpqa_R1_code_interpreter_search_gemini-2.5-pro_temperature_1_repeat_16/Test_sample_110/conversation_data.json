    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition. The reaction involves the formation of an enolate from a ketone, which then acts as a nucleophile (the Michael donor) and attacks an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (the Michael acceptor).\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Michael Donor):** The base, t-BuOK, will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone. We need to identify the available α-protons.\n    *   The structure of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one has the carbonyl group at C1.\n    *   The α-carbon at **C2** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   The α-carbon at **C6** is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position. The base t-BuOK abstracts the proton from C6 to form a specific enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6, and the negative charge is delocalized onto the oxygen atom. The carbon at C6 is the nucleophilic center.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:** The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. Subsequent workup (protonation) adds a proton to the α-carbon of the original acrylate moiety.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The starting ketone ring has: C1=O, a C2 with -Et and -Me, and a C6 with -Me.\n    *   The new substituent, derived from ethyl acrylate, is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` (a 2-(ethoxycarbonyl)ethyl group).\n    *   This group is attached to C6 of the ring.\n    *   So, the final product has the following groups on the ring: C1=O, C2(-Et, -Me), C6(-Me, -CH₂CH₂COOEt).\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:** The options provide names where the molecule is treated as a substituted ethyl propanoate. Let's follow this convention.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring system is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   We need to name the cyclohexyl substituent: `(...cyclohexyl)`. According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment to the main chain is numbered C-1' of the substituent ring.\n    *   Let's number the substituent ring starting from the attachment point (C1', which was C6 of the original ketone).\n        *   At **C1'** (the attachment point), there is a **methyl** group.\n        *   Moving around the ring, **C2'** (the original C1) has the ketone group (**oxo**).\n        *   **C3'** (the original C2) has both an **ethyl** and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name for A in options A and D.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Carbanion (Michael Donor):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the protons on the adjacent carbon (the α-carbon) acidic. KOH is a strong enough base to deprotonate the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane.\n    *   CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + OH⁻ ⇌ CH₃CH₂CH⁻(NO₂) + H₂O\n    *   The resulting carbanion (a nitronate anion) is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:** The carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon is C1 of 1-nitropropane.\n    *   The structure of the acceptor is CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. The attack occurs at the β-carbon.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the C1 of the nitropropane and the C3 (β-carbon) of the butenenitrile.\n    *   Protonation by water (the solvent) at the α-carbon of the nitrile completes the addition.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The nitropropane part contributes: `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-`\n    *   The butenenitrile part contributes: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   Combining them gives the final structure: **CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN**\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:** We use IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the suffix is `-nitrile`.\n    *   We find the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        `C6H₃-C5H₂-C4H(NO₂)-C3H(CH₃)-C2H₂-C1N`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbon atoms, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   There is a **methyl** group at C3.\n    *   There is a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents (methyl before nitro), the full name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name for B in options C and D.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given choices:\n*   A) A is correct, B is incorrect.\n*   B) A is incorrect, B is incorrect.\n*   C) A is incorrect, B is correct.\n*   D) A is correct, B is correct.\n\nTherefore, option D correctly identifies both major products.\n\n<<<D>>>"
