    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, we need to calculate its fraction relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nHere is the provided information:\n- Total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10^-2 M`\n- Thiocyanate ligand concentration, `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n- Overall stability constants for the formation of `[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)` from `Co^2+` and `n SCN-`:\n    - `β1` for `[Co(SCN)]+` = 9\n    - `β2` for `[Co(SCN)2]` = 40\n    - `β3` for `[Co(SCN)3]-` = 63\n    - `β4` for `[Co(SCN)4]2-` = 16\n\nThe cobalt in the solution exists in several forms: `Co^2+` (free ion), `[Co(SCN)]+`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]-`, and `[Co(SCN)4]2-`. The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]2-]`\n\nUsing the definitions of the overall stability constants (`βn`), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]` and the ligand concentration `[SCN-]`:\n- `[[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n- `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n- `[[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n- `[[Co(SCN)4]2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\nBy substituting these into the equation for the total cobalt concentration, we get:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\nThe fraction of any specific complex, `[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)`, relative to the total cobalt concentration is denoted by `αn`. For the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (`n=2`), the fraction `α2` is given by:\n`α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions from above, we get:\n`α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leaving:\n`α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\nSince the total cobalt concentration (`10^-2 M`) is significantly lower than the thiocyanate concentration (`0.1 M`), we can assume the free thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium is approximately `0.1 M`.\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values to calculate `α2`:\n- `[SCN-] = 0.1`\n- `β1 = 9`\n- `β2 = 40`\n- `β3 = 63`\n- `β4 = 16`\n\nLet's calculate each term in the denominator:\n- `1`\n- `β1 * [SCN-] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n- `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n- `β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n- `β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nThe denominator is the sum of these terms:\n`Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nThe numerator is the term for the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex:\n`Numerator = β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 0.4`\n\nNow, we calculate the fraction `α2`:\n`α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo find the percentage, we multiply the fraction by 100:\n`Percentage = 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\n```python\n# Define the stability constants and ligand concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nL = 0.1  # [SCN-]\n\n# Calculate the denominator (sum of all species terms)\n# The terms are: 1 for Co^2+, beta1*L^1, beta2*L^2, beta3*L^3, beta4*L^4\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * L + beta2 * L**2 + beta3 * L**3 + beta4 * L**4\n\n# Calculate the numerator for the second complex [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator_2 = beta2 * L**2\n\n# Calculate the fraction of the second complex\nalpha_2 = numerator_2 / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_2 = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage_2)\n```\n<<<\n16.91618032648228\n>>>\n\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is `[Co(SCN)2]`, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the species:** The cobalt in the solution can exist as the free ion `Co^2+` or as one of several complexes with thiocyanate (`SCN-`). The species are:\n    *   `Co^2+` (free ion)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]+` (monothiocyanato complex)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2]` (dithiocyanato complex)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]-` (trithiocyanato complex)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]2-` (tetrathiocyanato complex)\n\n2.  **Define the total concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]2-]`\n\n3.  **Use stability constants:** The overall stability constants (`βn`) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion (`[Co^2+]`) and the free ligand (`[SCN-]`).\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n4.  **Formulate the fraction (`α`) of the desired complex:** The fraction of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex, which we'll call `α2`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration.\n    `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n    By substituting the expressions from steps 2 and 3, we get:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4)`\n\n    We can cancel `[Co^2+]` from the numerator and the denominator:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n5.  **Plug in the values and calculate:**\n    *   Ligand concentration `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`. (We assume this concentration is constant because the ligand is in large excess compared to the metal ion).\n    *   `β1 = 9`\n    *   `β2 = 40`\n    *   `β3 = 63`\n    *   `β4 = 16`\n\n    First, let's calculate the value of the denominator (let's call it `D`):\n    *   `1`\n    *   `β1 * [SCN-] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n    *   `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   `β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   `β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n    *   `D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    Next, let's calculate the value of the numerator (let's call it `N`):\n    *   `N = β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n\n    Now, calculate the fraction `α2`:\n    *   `α2 = N / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n6.  **Convert to percentage:** To find the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100.\n    *   Percentage = `α2 * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%. Comparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
