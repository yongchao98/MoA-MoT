    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Premise:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is a constant value everywhere.\n\n2.  **Relating Star Count to Distance:** Let's consider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer.\n    *   The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3) * π * d³`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N` inside this sphere is the density multiplied by the volume:\n        `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3) * π * d³`\n    *   This equation tells us that the total number of stars up to a distance `d` is proportional to the cube of the distance: `N(d) ∝ d³`.\n\n3.  **Considering a Thin Shell:** Now, let's find the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell at distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell `dV` is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4 * π * d² * dd`.\n    *   The number of stars `dN` in this shell is the density multiplied by the shell's volume:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd`\n    *   This expression gives us the number of stars within a small distance range `dd` at distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Introducing Parallax:** The question asks about the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx), not distance. We need to convert our variables from distance (`d`, `dd`) to parallax (`plx`, `d(plx)`).\n    *   The relationship between parallax and distance is: `plx = 1/d` or `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We also need to relate the small distance interval `dd` to a small parallax interval `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n        `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are counting stars in a range (a bin), we are interested in the magnitude of the interval. So we can write: `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`.\n\n5.  **Substituting Parallax into the Star Count Equation:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` into our equation for `dN`:\n    *   We start with: `dN = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx)² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)` (using the magnitude): `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   Combine the terms: `dN = (ρ * 4 * π / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax Range:** The quantity \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" is `dN / d(plx)`.\n    *   From our last equation, we can divide both sides by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN / d(plx) = ρ * 4 * π / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `ρ`, `4`, and `π` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax varies as the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<D>>>"
