    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Part A)**\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. Keto-enol tautomerism is the most common form, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone)**: Its structure is a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds and two ketone groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4).\n        *   The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds.\n        *   These alpha-carbons are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n        *   Therefore, benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens and **cannot** undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: Its structure is a saturated six-membered ring with three ketone groups.\n        *   The carbon atoms between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n        *   Because it has alpha-hydrogens, it **can** undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form is phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic and highly stable compound. The equilibrium strongly favors this aromatic enol form.\n    *   **Conclusion for A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Part B)**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n        *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2). It is bonded to:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n        *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and **will show optical isomerism**.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate**:\n        *   The structure is the trans-isomer of a butenedioate ester: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n        *   It is a planar molecule and possesses a plane of symmetry.\n        *   It has no chiral centers.\n        *   Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and cannot be optically active.\n        *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **will not show optical isomerism**.\n    *   **Conclusion for B**: The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Formulation**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
