    "This problem requires us to find the pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The final pH will be determined by the substance that is in excess after all neutralization reactions have occurred.\n\nHere is a step-by-step process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of acidic and basic species.**\n\n*   **Moles of Acetic Acid (CH3COOH):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.05 mol CH3COOH\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen ions (H+) from Hydrochloric Acid (HCl):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it completely dissociates: HCl -> H+ + Cl-\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of H+ = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.08 mol H+\n\n*   **Moles of Hydroxide ions (OH-) from Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2):**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it completely dissociates: Ba(OH)2 -> Ba2+ + 2OH-\n    *   Note that each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH-.\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of OH- = Molarity × Volume × 2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L × 2 = 0.18 mol OH-\n\n**Step 2: Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe strong acid (H+) and strong base (OH-) will react first until one is completely consumed.\nReaction: H+ + OH- -> H2O\n\n*   Initial moles of H+ (from HCl) = 0.08 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2) = 0.18 mol\n\nSince there are more moles of OH- than H+, the H+ is the limiting reactant.\n*   Moles of OH- reacted with H+ = 0.08 mol\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\nReaction: CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\n\n*   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of OH- available = 0.10 mol\n\nThe CH3COOH is the limiting reactant in this step.\n*   Moles of OH- reacted with CH3COOH = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of OH- in excess = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the final concentration of the excess species.**\n\nThe final solution contains 0.05 moles of excess OH-, which is a strong base and will determine the pH. First, we need the total volume of the solution.\n\n*   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\nNow, calculate the final concentration of OH-.\n*   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n*   [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pOH and pH of the solution.**\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   At 25°C, pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.
