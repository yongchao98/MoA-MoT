    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   This is an epoxide fused to a substituted cyclohexane ring. The base name `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes cyclohexane oxide, where the epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6, with the oxygen being atom 7.\n    *   The substituents are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is specified as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate).\n    *   This is a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem states two key rules for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack occurs with inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon (an Sₙ2-type mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6. We need to compare their steric hindrance.\n*   **Carbon C1:** It is bonded to C2, C6, the epoxide oxygen (O7), and a methyl group. This is a **quaternary** carbon center.\n*   **Carbon C6:** It is bonded to C1, C5, the epoxide oxygen (O7), and a hydrogen atom. This is a **tertiary** carbon center.\n*   Comparing a quaternary center to a tertiary center, **C6 is significantly less sterically hindered**.\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure and Name of the Product**\n\n*   When the nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6, the C6-O bond breaks. The C1-O bond also breaks upon acidic workup (which is implicit in these reactions to protonate the resulting alkoxide). The oxygen atom becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group attached to C1.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol ring. Let's determine the positions of all the groups:\n    *   -OH group is at C1.\n    *   Original methyl groups are at C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The new methyl group (from the reagent) is now at C6.\n*   So, the product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol. To name it correctly according to IUPAC rules, we must:\n    1.  Assign the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) as C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the reactant.\n    2.  Number the ring to give the substituents (the four methyl groups) the lowest possible set of locants.\n    *   The methyl groups are at original positions C1, C3, C4, and C6.\n    *   Let's consider the two possible numbering directions starting from the OH-bearing carbon (old C1) as new C1:\n        *   Path A (numbering towards old C2): Me groups are at 1, 3, 4, 6. Set of locants: {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n        *   Path B (numbering towards old C6): The carbon at old C6 is now new C2. The carbon at old C4 is new C4. The carbon at old C3 is new C5. Me groups are at 1, 2, 4, 5. Set of locants: {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Comparing the locant sets {1, 3, 4, 6} and {1, 2, 4, 5} at the first point of difference, 2 is lower than 3. Therefore, Path B gives the correct IUPAC numbering.\n*   The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches the naming pattern in options A, B, and D. Option C has a different substitution pattern and can be eliminated.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nWe need to track the configuration of each stereocenter from the reactant to the product.\n\n*   **New C2 (from old C6):** This is the site of the Sₙ2 attack. The configuration must be inverted.\n    *   Reactant configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n    *   After inversion, the product configuration at new C2 must be **(R)**.\n\n*   **New C1 (from old C1):** This center is not directly attacked, so its spatial arrangement of bonds does not change. However, its R/S designation could change if the priority of its substituents changes.\n    *   Reactant priorities at C1: O > C6 > C2 > Me. Configuration is **(1R)**.\n    *   Product priorities at C1: OH > new C2 (old C6) > new C6 (old C2) > Me. The priority of old C6 (now with an added Me) versus old C2 (unchanged) remains the same because C(with Me) is higher priority than CH₂. The overall priority order does not change.\n    *   Since the geometry and priority order are unchanged, the configuration remains **(R)**. Product is **(1R)**.\n\n*   **New C4 (from old C4):** This center is remote from the reaction site. In the absence of obvious electronic changes that would reorder substituent priorities, we can assume its configuration is retained.\n    *   Reactant configuration at C4 is **(R)**.\n    *   Product configuration at new C4 is assumed to be **(R)**. Product is **(4R)**.\n\n*   **New C5 (from old C3):** This center is also remote. We assume its configuration is retained.\n    *   Reactant configuration at C3 is **(R)**.\n    *   Product configuration at new C5 is assumed to be **(R)**. Product is **(5R)**.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Product Name**\n\nCombining the results from steps 3 and 4:\n\n*   Name: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   Stereochemistry: (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**6. Match with Options**\n\nComparing our derived product name with the given options:\nA) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect structure.\nB) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\nC) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect structure and stereochemistry.\nD) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - **This matches our result perfectly.**\n\n<<<D>>>"
