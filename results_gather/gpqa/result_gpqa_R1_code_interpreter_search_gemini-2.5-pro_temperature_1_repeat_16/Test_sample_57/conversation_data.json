    "*   **Analysis of the Question:** The question asks to identify which of the given physical theories does not need a procedure called \"regularization\" to handle problems that arise at high energies (or, equivalently, at very small distances). This problem is often referred to as an \"ultraviolet (UV) divergence.\"\n\n*   **What is Regularization?** In Quantum Field Theory (QFT), when we calculate physical quantities like the probability of particle interactions, we often encounter mathematical expressions that result in infinity. These infinities typically come from loops in Feynman diagrams, which represent virtual particles with arbitrarily high energy and momentum. Regularization is a technique to temporarily modify the theory to make these calculations finite. A common method is to introduce an \"energy cutoff,\" essentially assuming the theory is only valid up to a certain maximum energy. After the calculation is done, a related process called renormalization is used to absorb the infinities into the definition of physical constants (like mass and charge), allowing us to get finite, meaningful predictions as the cutoff is removed. A theory that needs this process is called \"renormalizable.\"\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is the quantum theory of light and matter interaction. It is a cornerstone of the Standard Model. QED is a quantum field theory, and when performing calculations beyond the simplest approximations (i.e., when including loop diagrams), it famously produces infinite results. It is a *renormalizable* theory, meaning we have a well-defined procedure of regularization and renormalization to handle these infinities. Therefore, QED *requires* regularization.\n\n    *   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory is described by Maxwell's equations. While it is not a quantum theory, it has its own high-energy problem. If you model an electron as a point particle (with zero radius), the energy stored in its own electric field (its self-energy) becomes infinite. To get a finite answer, one must \"regularize\" the theory, for instance, by assuming the electron has a small but non-zero radius. So, even classical electrodynamics faces a type of high-energy divergence that requires regularization.\n\n    *   **C) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** QCD is the quantum field theory of the strong force, which binds quarks together to form protons and neutrons. Like QED, it is a quantum field theory and a key part of the Standard Model. Calculations involving loops of quarks and gluons also lead to infinities. QCD is also a renormalizable theory. Therefore, QCD *requires* regularization.\n\n    *   **D) Superstring Theory:** Superstring theory is a theoretical framework that attempts to unify all fundamental forces of nature, including gravity. In this theory, the fundamental constituents of the universe are not point-like particles but tiny, one-dimensional vibrating \"strings.\" One of the primary motivations for string theory is that it appears to be free from the ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences that plague quantum field theories. The finite size of the strings effectively \"smears out\" the interactions at very small distances, smoothing away the infinities that would otherwise appear. As a result, calculations in superstring theory are believed to yield finite results without the need for an ad-hoc regularization and renormalization procedure. It has a natural, built-in cutoff at the string scale.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** QED, QCD, and Classical Electrodynamics all encounter infinities at high energies/short distances that must be dealt with by some form of regularization. Superstring Theory is specifically formulated in a way that is believed to avoid these infinities altogether.\n\n<<<D>>>"
