    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial State\nThe system consists of two electrons, each in a p orbital. This means the orbital angular momentum quantum number for each electron is $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\nThe system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\nThis notation means:\n*   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1.\n*   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2.\n*   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the 2-electron system. The possible values for $l$ are given by the rule $|l_1 - l_2| \\le l \\le l_1 + l_2$, which for $l_1=1, l_2=1$ gives $l=0, 1, 2$. The system is specified to be in the $l=2$ state.\n*   $m = -1$: The quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n### 2. Understand the Measurement and Desired Outcome\nA measurement is made of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, which are represented by the operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\nThe possible eigenvalues for $L_{1z}$ are $m_1\\hbar$, where $m_1$ can be $-1, 0, 1$ (since $l_1=1$).\nSimilarly, the possible eigenvalues for $L_{2z}$ are $m_2\\hbar$, where $m_2$ can be $-1, 0, 1$ (since $l_2=1$).\n\nThe question asks for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\nThis corresponds to the measurement outcome:\n*   For electron 1: $m_1 = -1$.\n*   For electron 2: $m_2 = -1$.\n\n### 3. Relate the Initial State to the Measurement Outcome\nThe state corresponding to the desired measurement outcome is the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\nThe probability of obtaining this outcome is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto this final state.\nProbability $P = |<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l_1, l_2, l, m>|^2$\n$P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$\n\n### 4. Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum\nA key principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n$L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\nThis relationship also holds for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nThe initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with a well-defined quantum number $m = -1$.\nWhen we measure $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, the outcomes $m_1$ and $m_2$ must satisfy the condition $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\nIn this case, any possible measurement outcome must have $m_1 + m_2 = -1$.\n\nLet's check the desired measurement outcome:\n*   $m_1 = -1$\n*   $m_2 = -1$\nThe sum is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince the required sum for the outcome ($m = -2$) does not match the known value for the initial state ($m = -1$), this outcome is forbidden by the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n### 5. Formal Justification (Orthogonality)\nThe initial state $|\\psi_{initial}> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$.\nThe final state corresponding to the measurement, $|\\psi_{final}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$, is also an eigenstate of $L_z$. Its eigenvalue is $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = (-1-1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.\n\nEigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) that correspond to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. Therefore, the inner product of these two states is zero:\n$<\\psi_{final} | \\psi_{initial}> = <1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$\n\nThe probability is the square of the magnitude of this inner product:\n$P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\n### 6. Expansion using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients (Optional)\nThe coupled state can be expanded in terms of the uncoupled states using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The expansion only includes terms where $m_1+m_2=m$.\n$|1, 1, 2, -1> = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} <1, m_1; 1, m_2 | 2, -1> |1, m_1; 1, m_2>$\nSince $m=-1$, the sum is over pairs $(m_1, m_2)$ such that $m_1+m_2=-1$. The possible pairs are $(0, -1)$ and $(-1, 0)$.\nThe expansion is:\n$|1, 1, 2, -1> = <1, 0; 1, -1 | 2, -1> |1, 0; 1, -1> + <1, -1; 1, 0 | 2, -1> |1, -1; 1, 0>$\nThe values of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are $<1, 0; 1, -1 | 2, -1> = 1/\\sqrt{2}$ and $<1, -1; 1, 0 | 2, -1> = 1/\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo, $|1, 1, 2, -1> = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1, 0; 1, -1> + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1, -1; 1, 0>$.\n\nThe state we are looking for is $|1, -1; 1, -1>$. As you can see, this state does not appear in the expansion of $|1, 1, 2, -1>$. Its coefficient is zero. The probability is therefore $0^2=0$.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe probability of measuring the z-components of orbital angular momentum to be $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is zero, because this outcome would violate the conservation of the z-component of the total angular momentum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
