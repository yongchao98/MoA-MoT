    "This problem requires calculating the pH at two different points during the titration of a weak acid (acetic acid) with a strong base (NaOH).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\nThe initial solution of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. The new volume is 40.00 cm³. We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂.\n\n*   M₁ = 0.05 M\n*   V₁ = 20.00 cm³\n*   V₂ = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   M₂ = (M₁ * V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, the concentration of the acetic acid solution to be titrated is 0.025 M.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt any point before the equivalence point in a weak acid-strong base titration, the solution contains a mixture of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), forming a buffer. The pH of this buffer can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\nwhere [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.\n\nFirst, we calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n*   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), and 75% remains as acetic acid (HA). The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is therefore 25/75 or 1/3.\n\nNow, we plug this into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n*   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n*   pH = 4.733 - log(3)\n*   pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution now contains only the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), which hydrolyzes water, making the solution basic:\n\nCH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n\nTo find the pH, we first need to calculate the concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point.\n\n1.  **Moles of acetic acid:**\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n2.  **Volume of NaOH needed:**\n    At the equivalence point, moles NaOH = moles CH₃COOH.\n    Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n3.  **Total volume at equivalence point:**\n    Total Volume = Volume of acid solution + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n4.  **Concentration of acetate ([CH₃COO⁻]):**\n    The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid.\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n\nNow, we calculate the concentration of OH⁻ produced from the hydrolysis of acetate. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n*   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nWe set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis reaction, where x = [OH⁻]:\n*   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n*   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\nSince Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n*   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n*   x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n*   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\nNow, we can calculate pOH and then pH:\n*   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n*   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH = 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa_acetic_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# Initial conditions\ninitial_acid_conc_M1 = 0.05  # M\ninitial_acid_vol_V1 = 20.00 # cm3\ndilution_water_vol = 20.00  # cm3\ntitrant_base_conc = 0.1     # M\n\n# Step 1: Dilution\nfinal_acid_vol_V2 = initial_acid_vol_V1 + dilution_water_vol # cm3\nfinal_acid_conc_M2 = (initial_acid_conc_M1 * initial_acid_vol_V1) / final_acid_vol_V2 # M\n\n# Step 2: pH at 25% titration\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acetic_acid)\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 0.25 / 0.75\nratio_A_HA = 0.25 / 0.75\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio_A_HA)\n\n# Step 3: pH at equivalence point\n# Moles of acid to be titrated\nmoles_acid = final_acid_conc_M2 * (final_acid_vol_V2 / 1000) # mol\n\n# Volume of base needed to reach equivalence\nvol_base_equiv = moles_acid / titrant_base_conc # L\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_equiv = (final_acid_vol_V2 / 1000) + vol_base_equiv # L\n\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence\n# Moles of acetate produced equals initial moles of acid\nmoles_acetate = moles_acid\nconc_acetate_equiv = moles_acetate / total_vol_equiv # M\n\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb_acetate = Kw / Ka_acetic_acid\n\n# Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis of acetate: Kb = x^2 / (C - x) ~= x^2 / C\n# x = [OH-]\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb_acetate * conc_acetate_equiv)\n\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npOH_equiv = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_at_equiv = 14.00 - pOH_equiv\n\nprint(f\"The pH at 25% titration is: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The pH at the equivalence point is: {pH_at_equiv:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
