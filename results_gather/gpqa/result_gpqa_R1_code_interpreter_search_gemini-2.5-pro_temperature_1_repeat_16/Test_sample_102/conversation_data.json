    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Parent Structure:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   Bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   Nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are arranged in a 1,3,5-pattern. All substituents are *meta* with respect to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents on the benzene ring direct new substituents to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nWe need to find a sequence of reactions that introduces these three groups in the correct positions to achieve the 1,3,5-pattern in high yield.\n\n**Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n\n*   **Step i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction forms acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is now on the ring. This is a meta-director.\n    *   Product: Acetophenone.\n*   **Step ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 (Bromination):** The acetyl group is a meta-director. Therefore, the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) will add at the meta position (position 3).\n    *   Product: 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one (or 3-bromoacetophenone).\n*   **Step iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** Now the ring has two substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH3) at C1 and a bromo group (-Br) at C3.\n    *   The -COCH3 group is a *meta*-director and strongly deactivating. It directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director. It directs the incoming nitro group to positions 2, 4, and 6 (relative to C1).\n    *   The directing effects are in conflict. However, the acetyl group is a much stronger deactivating group than bromine. It strongly deactivates its ortho and para positions (2, 4, 6), making them much less reactive. The position least deactivated is C5, which is meta to both existing groups. Therefore, nitration occurs preferentially at position 5.\n    *   Product: **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. This is the desired target molecule.\n\nThis sequence successfully synthesizes the target molecule in high yield through the first three steps. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are unnecessary for the synthesis of the target molecule and would lead to a different final product. However, since the question asks for a sequence that *leads to* the synthesis, and this is the only option that contains a valid pathway, it is the most likely correct answer.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n\n*   **Step i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4:** Forms nitrobenzene.\n*   **Step ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl:** Reduces the nitro group to an amino group, forming aniline.\n*   **Step iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation attempt on aniline. This reaction does not work as intended because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), deactivating the ring and preventing acylation. This sequence fails at this step.\n\n**Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2 ; ...**\n\n*   **Step i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.**\n*   **Step ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.**\n*   **Step iii) Aniline -> Benzenediazonium chloride.**\n*   **Step iv) Benzenediazonium chloride + H3PO2 (Deamination):** This reaction removes the amino group and replaces it with a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Product: Benzene.\nThis sequence starts with benzene and, after four steps, returns to benzene. It is a pointless sequence and therefore incorrect.\n\n**Option D: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n\n*   **Step i) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3:** Forms bromobenzene.\n*   **Step ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4:** The bromo group is an o,p-director, so this step forms a mixture of 2-bromonitrobenzene and 4-bromonitrobenzene.\n*   **Step iii) Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring containing a nitro group. The nitro group is strongly deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on nitro-substituted rings. This sequence fails at this step.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly Option A describes a chemically sound and high-yield pathway to the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Although the sequence listed in option A contains additional, unnecessary steps, it is the only choice that includes a valid synthesis of the desired product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
