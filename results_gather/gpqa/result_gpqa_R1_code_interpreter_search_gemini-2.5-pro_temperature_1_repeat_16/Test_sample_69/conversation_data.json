    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle and determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 4: D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent) (1:1 ratio)**\n    This clue describes a 1:1 reaction between two gases to form a solvent. A classic and well-known example of such a reaction is the synthesis of phosgene:\n    CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l)\n    Phosgene (COCl₂) is a liquid at room temperature (boiling point 8 °C) and has been used as a solvent and a reagent. This strongly suggests that {B, D} are {CO, Cl₂} and H is COCl₂.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1: reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.**\n    We have two possibilities for gas B: CO or Cl₂.\n    *   If B = Cl₂, the reaction is A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → C. This would mean C is a polychloride, likely ACl₁₆. Finding a stable, bright red compound with this formula is highly improbable.\n    *   If B = CO, the reaction is A(s) + 8CO(g) → C. This points towards a metal carbonyl. A very common metal carbonyl reaction is:\n        2Co(s) + 8CO(g) → Co₂(CO)₈(s)\n        Here, the solid A would be Cobalt (Co). The product C would be dicobalt octacarbonyl (Co₂(CO)₈). Co₂(CO)₈ is described as an orange to reddish-brown solid, which is a reasonable fit for \"bright red\" in the context of a puzzle. The stoichiometry fits perfectly if we consider the reaction for 2 moles of A.\n\n    Let's proceed with this hypothesis:\n    *   **A = Co** (Cobalt)\n    *   **B = CO** (Carbon monoxide)\n    *   **C = Co₂(CO)₈** (Dicobalt octacarbonyl)\n    *   **D = Cl₂** (Chlorine)\n    *   **H = COCl₂** (Phosgene)\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 2: When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.**\n    Substituting our identified compounds:\n    Co₂(CO)₈ (C) + 2Cl₂ (D) → E\n    Metal carbonyls react with halogens. With a sufficient amount of halogen, the carbon monoxide ligands are fully displaced. The reaction is:\n    Co₂(CO)₈ + 2Cl₂ → 2CoCl₂ + 8CO\n    This reaction is indeed \"extremely hazardous\" because it produces 8 moles of carbon monoxide (CO), which is a highly toxic gas, for every mole of C that reacts. The new solid product formed, E, is **CoCl₂** (Cobalt(II) chloride).\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 3: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.**\n    This reaction is: Co₂(CO)₈ + H₂O → Co + F + G.\n    The hydrolysis of cobalt carbonyls is complex. However, it is known that they can form tetracarbonylhydrocobalt(I), HCo(CO)₄. This is a known **strong acid**, so we can identify **F = HCo(CO)₄**. The decomposition also releases CO, which reacts with water to form carbonic acid, H₂CO₃. Carbonic acid is a **weak acid**, so **G = H₂CO₃**. Under various conditions, cobalt carbonyl complexes can decompose to give metallic **cobalt (A)**. While this is not a simple one-step hydrolysis, it is plausible that these are the ultimate products, making the clue consistent with our hypothesis.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E.**\n    We have identified E as **CoCl₂**. The question asks for the *molecular* symmetry group, which implies the structure of the isolated molecule, typically in the gas phase.\n    In the gas phase, the CoCl₂ molecule is monomeric. According to VSEPR theory, it has a linear geometry:\n    Cl — Co — Cl\n    Now, let's determine the point group for this linear molecule:\n    *   It has an infinite-fold principal rotation axis (C∞) along the bonds.\n    *   It has a center of inversion (i) at the cobalt atom.\n    *   It has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C∞ axis and passing through the Co atom.\n    *   The presence of a C∞ axis and a σh plane defines the **D∞h** point group.\n\nThe options are:\nA) D∞h\nB) D4h\nC) C2v\nD) C2\n\nOur derived point group for E (CoCl₂) is D∞h, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
