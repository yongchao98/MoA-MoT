    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This value is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The high value (downfield shift) suggests the proton is attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative atom, like oxygen.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal corresponds to a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, which means this proton is coupled to (is adjacent to) one other non-equivalent proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a crucial piece of information. For protons across a double bond (vinylic coupling), a large J value (typically 12-18 Hz) is characteristic of a *trans* stereochemical relationship. A *cis* relationship would show a smaller J value (typically 6-12 Hz). This strongly indicates a *trans* double bond.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region, representing the other proton on the double bond.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal corresponds to one proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different groups of protons.\n        *   The **doublet (d)** splitting is due to coupling with the other vinylic proton at 7.0 ppm.\n        *   The **quartet (q)** splitting means it is also coupled to a group of three equivalent protons, which must be a methyl (-CH3) group.\n\n*   **Signal 3: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is very characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon of an acetate group (CH3-C(=O)-O-).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** The signal represents three protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, meaning this methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with. This fits the acetate structure, as the carbonyl carbon has no protons.\n\n*   **Signal 4: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region (protons on a carbon adjacent to a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three protons, another methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This methyl group is coupled to a single proton. This confirms the observation from the signal at 5.5 ppm, which was a quartet due to coupling with this methyl group.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   From the signal at 2.1 ppm, we identify an **acetate group**: CH3-C(=O)O-\n*   From the signals at 7.0 ppm, 5.5 ppm, and 1.6 ppm, we can deduce the rest of the molecule. We have a double bond with two protons and an adjacent methyl group. The structure fragment is **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n*   The J value of 16.0 Hz tells us the two protons on the double bond are **trans** to each other.\n*   The proton at 7.0 ppm is only a doublet, so it's only coupled to the other vinylic proton. Its high chemical shift means it's attached to the oxygen of the acetate group.\n*   The proton at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets, meaning it's coupled to the other vinylic proton and the adjacent methyl group.\n\nCombining these pieces gives the following structure:\n\n```\n      O\n     //\nCH3--C\n     \\\n      O         H\n       \\       /\n        C == C\n       /       \\\n      H         CH3\n```\nThis structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) Trans-propenyl acetate:** This matches our deduced structure perfectly. The name indicates a three-carbon \"propenyl\" group, an \"acetate\" group, and a \"trans\" configuration, all of which are supported by the NMR data.\n*   **B) Cis-butenyl acetate:** \"Cis\" is incorrect due to the large J value. \"Butenyl\" (4-carbon chain) is incorrect as the proton count and splitting pattern do not match a butenyl group.\n*   **C) Trans-butenyl acetate:** \"Butenyl\" is incorrect.\n*   **D) Cis-propenyl acetate:** \"Cis\" is incorrect due to the large J value (16.0 Hz).\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
