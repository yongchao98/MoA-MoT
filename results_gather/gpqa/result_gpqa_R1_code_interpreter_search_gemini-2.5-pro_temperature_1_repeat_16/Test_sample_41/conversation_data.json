    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of an exoplanet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n    Since all three planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are constants for the system. The problem states that the albedo (`A`) is the same for all three planets. Therefore, the term `T_star * R_star^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4) / 2^(1/2)` is a constant for all three planets.\n\n    This simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\n    `T_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2)` or `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`\n\n    From this, we can establish a relationship for the semi-major axis `a`:\n    `a ∝ 1 / T_eq^2` or `a ∝ T_eq^(-2)`\n\n2.  **Use the given temperature ratios to find the ratio of the semi-major axes.**\n    We need to find the ratio `a3 / a1`. Using the proportionality from step 1:\n    `a3 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^2`\n\n    We are given the following ratios:\n    *   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4`\n    *   `T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3`\n\n    We can find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3` by multiplying the given ratios:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`\n\n    Now, we can calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    `a3 / a1 = (3.22)^2 = 10.3684`\n\n3.  **Use Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of the orbital periods.**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`):\n    `P^2 ∝ a^3`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `P ∝ a^(3/2)`\n\n    We want to find the ratio `P3 / P1`. Using the proportionality:\n    `P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)`\n\n    Substitute the value of `a3 / a1` we found in step 2:\n    `P3 / P1 = (10.3684)^(3/2)`\n    `P3 / P1 = ((3.22)^2)^(3/2)`\n    `P3 / P1 = (3.22)^3`\n\n4.  **Calculate the final value.**\n    We will perform the final calculation to get the numerical answer.\n\n```python\n# Given temperature ratios\nT_ratio_1_2 = 1.4\nT_ratio_2_3 = 2.3\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet3 is the product of the individual ratios.\n# T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3)\nT_ratio_1_3 = T_ratio_1_2 * T_ratio_2_3\n\n# The equilibrium temperature T_eq is proportional to a^(-1/2), where 'a' is the semi-major axis.\n# This means a is proportional to T_eq^(-2).\n# Therefore, a3 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^2.\n\n# Kepler's Third Law states that the orbital period P is proportional to a^(3/2).\n# Therefore, P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2).\n\n# Combining these relationships:\n# P3 / P1 = ((T_eq1 / T_eq3)^2)^(3/2) = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3\nperiod_ratio_3_1 = T_ratio_1_3**3\n\nprint(period_ratio_3_1)\n```\n<execute_result>\n33.386248\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculation shows that the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.386. This value rounded to one decimal place is 33.4.\n\nThe information about the planets' masses and the TTV discovery method is not required for this specific calculation, as the mass of the planets is assumed to be negligible compared to the mass of the central star, a standard assumption in applying the simplified version of Kepler's Third Law. The albedo value is also not needed, only that it is equal for all planets, which simplifies the temperature-distance relationship.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~ 3.2\nB) ~ 10.4\nC) ~ 4.4\nD) ~ 33.4\n\nOur calculated value of ~33.4 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (`a`) from the star, assuming the star's properties and the planet's albedo are constant.\n    `T_eq ∝ 1 / √a` or `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`\n    This implies that the orbital distance `a` is inversely proportional to the square of the equilibrium temperature:\n    `a ∝ 1 / T_eq²` or `a ∝ T_eq⁻²`\n\n2.  **Ratio of Orbital Distances:**\n    We need to find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 (`a3`) to that of Planet1 (`a1`). Using the relationship from step 1:\n    `a3 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)²`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Temperature Ratio:**\n    We are given the temperature ratios:\n    *   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4`\n    *   `T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3`\n    To find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3`, we multiply the given ratios:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`\n\n4.  **Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance (`a`):\n    `P² ∝ a³`\n    This means the orbital period is proportional to the orbital distance raised to the power of 3/2:\n    `P ∝ a^(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods:**\n    Using the relationship from Kepler's Law, the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 (`P3`) to that of Planet1 (`P1`) is:\n    `P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)`\n    Now, substitute the expression for the ratio of orbital distances from step 2:\n    `P3 / P1 = ((T_eq1 / T_eq3)²) ^ (3/2)`\n    `P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³`\n    Finally, substitute the calculated temperature ratio from step 3:\n    `P3 / P1 = (3.22)³ ≈ 33.386`\n\nRounding the result to one decimal place gives 33.4. The information about the masses and the albedo value is not needed for this calculation, as long as the albedo is the same for all planets.\n\n<<<D>>>"
