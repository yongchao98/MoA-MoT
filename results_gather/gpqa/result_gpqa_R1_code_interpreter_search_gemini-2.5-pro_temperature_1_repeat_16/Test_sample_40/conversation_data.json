    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n**1. Define the reference frames:**\n*   Let `S` be the laboratory frame (the observer's frame).\n*   Let `S'` be the rest frame of the glass.\n\n**2. Identify the known velocities:**\n*   The velocity of the glass (`S'` frame) relative to the laboratory (`S` frame) is `v`. The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam.\n*   The speed of light inside the glass, as measured in the rest frame of the glass (`S'` frame), is `u'`. The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`).\n    *   `n = c / u'`\n    *   Given that the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`, we have:\n    *   `n = 1 / u'`, which means `u' = 1/n`.\n\n**3. Determine the goal:**\n*   We need to find the speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (`S` frame). Let's call this speed `u`.\n\n**4. Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:**\n*   The formula for adding velocities along the same direction in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' * v / c^2)`\n    where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object in frame `S`.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object in frame `S'`.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of frame `S'` relative to frame `S`.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n**5. Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n*   We have `u' = 1/n`, `v = v`, and `c = 1`.\n*   Substituting these into the velocity addition formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n**6. Simplify the expression:**\n*   To simplify the fraction, we can find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and the denominator.\n*   In the numerator: `(1/n) + v = (1 + n*v) / n`\n*   In the denominator: `1 + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n*   Now, substitute these back into the expression for `u`:\n    `u = ( (1 + n*v) / n ) / ( (n + v) / n )`\n*   We can cancel the `n` in the denominator of both the main numerator and the main denominator:\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n**7. Compare with the given options:**\n*   The derived speed `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option C.\n\nA) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nB) 1\nC) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\nD) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
