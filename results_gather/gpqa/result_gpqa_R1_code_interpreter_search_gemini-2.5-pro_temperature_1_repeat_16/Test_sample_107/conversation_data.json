    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the problem\n\nWe need to compare two quantities:\n1.  **The paramagnetic coupling energy ($\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$)**: This is the energy of interaction between the electron's orbital magnetic moment and an external magnetic field. This effect is a part of the Zeeman effect.\n2.  **The transition energy ($\\Delta E$)**: This is the energy difference between two electronic states in a Hydrogen atom, corresponding to the emission or absorption of a photon with a specific wavelength.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$)\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the paramagnetic coupling (interaction of the orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field) is given by:\n$H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nwhere:\n- $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic moment of the electron.\n- $\\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field.\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian, we get:\n$H = \\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe magnetic field is given as parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The dot product becomes:\n$\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$\n\nThe energy of this interaction is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. For a state with orbital magnetic quantum number $m$, the eigenvalue of the $L_z$ operator is $m\\hbar$. Therefore, the energy is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e}{2m_e}(m\\hbar)B$\n\nWe can recognize the term $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ as the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$.\nSo, the expression simplifies to:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B$\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n-   **B**: The magnetic field strength is 1 T.\n-   **m**: We are told to use a \"small value\" for the orbital magnetic quantum number. Let's take $m=1$ as a representative case.\n-   **$\\mu_B$**: The Bohr magneton is a physical constant with a value of approximately $9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T}$.\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T}) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T}) = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J}$\n\nTo make the comparison easier, let's convert this energy to electron-volts (eV), a more common unit for atomic physics.\n$1 \\, \\text{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}$\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J/eV}} \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nwhere:\n-   **h**: Planck's constant, $6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{s}$\n-   **c**: The speed of light, $3.0 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}$\n-   **$\\lambda$**: The given wavelength is $0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$.\n\nLet's calculate $\\Delta E$:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{s}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}} \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}$\n\nNow, let's convert this to eV:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J/eV}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\n(Note: This wavelength corresponds to the Balmer-beta transition in Hydrogen, from the $n=4$ to the $n=2$ energy level, which is a typical optical transition.)\n\n### 4. Comparing the Magnitudes\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n-   **Paramagnetic Coupling Energy**: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n-   **Transition Energy**: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nLet's look at the ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}}{2.55 \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThis ratio is extremely small ($0.0000227$). This means the energy from the paramagnetic coupling to a 1 Tesla magnetic field is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the energy of a typical electronic transition in the visible spectrum.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the paramagnetic coupling energy is much, much less than the transition energy.\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
