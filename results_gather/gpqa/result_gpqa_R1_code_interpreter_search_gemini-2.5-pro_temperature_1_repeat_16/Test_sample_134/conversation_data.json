    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Interaction Lagrangian:**\n    The provided Lagrangian density for the interaction is:\n    $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f (\\upsilon + X) \\psi_f = -\\lambda_f \\upsilon \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f - \\lambda_f X \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f$\n\n    The term $- \\lambda_f X \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f$ describes the interaction between the boson $X$ and a pair of fermions $f$ (represented by the field $\\psi_f$). This term allows for the decay of the boson $X$ into a fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$), i.e., $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Kinematic Condition for Decay:**\n    For any decay to be possible, it must be \"kinematically allowed\". This means the mass of the initial (parent) particle must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of the final (daughter) particles. This is a direct consequence of the conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n    *   Mass of the parent particle (boson X): $M_X$\n    *   Mass of the daughter particles (fermion $f$ and antifermion $\\bar{f}$): $m_f$ and $m_{\\bar{f}}$. A particle and its antiparticle have the same mass, so $m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$.\n    *   Total mass of daughter particles: $m_f + m_{\\bar{f}} = 2m_f$.\n\n    The kinematic condition is:\n    $M_X \\ge 2m_f$\n\n3.  **Apply the Given Values:**\n    We are given the mass of the boson X:\n    $M_X = 6 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n    Substituting this value into the kinematic condition, we get:\n    $6 \\text{ GeV} \\ge 2m_f$\n    This simplifies to:\n    $m_f \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n    So, the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair $f\\bar{f}$ as long as the mass of the fermion $f$ is less than or equal to 3 GeV.\n\n4.  **Check the Masses of Fundamental Fermions:**\n    Now we need to check the masses of all fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) to see which ones satisfy this condition. We use the standard values for fermion masses (from the Particle Data Group).\n\n    *   **Leptons:**\n        *   Electron ($e$): $m_e \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.000511 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.000511 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow e^+e^-$ is **allowed**.\n        *   Muon ($\\mu$): $m_\\mu \\approx 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.1057 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.1057 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\mu^+\\mu^-$ is **allowed**.\n        *   Tau ($\\tau$): $m_\\tau \\approx 1.777 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $1.777 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\tau^+\\tau^-$ is **allowed**.\n\n    *   **Quarks:**\n        *   Up quark ($u$): $m_u \\approx 2.2 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0022 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.0022 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is **allowed**.\n        *   Down quark ($d$): $m_d \\approx 4.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0047 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.0047 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ is **allowed**.\n        *   Strange quark ($s$): $m_s \\approx 95 \\text{ MeV} = 0.095 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.095 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is **allowed**.\n        *   Charm quark ($c$): $m_c \\approx 1.27 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $1.27 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is **allowed**.\n        *   Bottom quark ($b$): $m_b \\approx 4.18 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $4.18 \\text{ GeV} > 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **not allowed**.\n        *   Top quark ($t$): $m_t \\approx 173 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $173 \\text{ GeV} > 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **not allowed**.\n\n5.  **Compile the Final List and Compare with Options:**\n    The complete list of kinematically allowed decay modes at the lowest order is:\n    $X \\rightarrow e^+e^-, \\mu^+\\mu^-, \\tau^+\\tau^-, u\\bar{u}, d\\bar{d}, s\\bar{s}, c\\bar{c}$.\n\n    Now, let's compare this list with the given choices:\n    *   A) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes $b\\bar{b}$ and omits $c\\bar{c}$)\n    *   B) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes $b\\bar{b}$ and omits $c\\bar{c}, \\mu^+\\mu^-$)\n    *   C) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes $t\\bar{t}$)\n    *   D) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Correct, matches our derived list exactly)\n\n<<<D>>>"
