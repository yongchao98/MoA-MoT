    "The user wants to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis (Orbital Radius)**\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a). For circular orbits, the semi-major axis is the orbital radius.\nP² ∝ a³\nThis can be rewritten as:\na ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nSo, the ratio of the semi-major axes of two planets (a₄ and a₂) can be expressed in terms of their orbital periods (P₄ and P₂):\n(a₄ / a₂) = (P₄ / P₂)^(2/3)\n\n**2. Understand the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Semi-Major Axis**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2a))\nWhere:\n*   T_star = Star's temperature\n*   R_star = Star's radius\n*   A = Albedo\n*   a = Semi-major axis\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star (T_star and R_star are constant) and have the same albedo (A is constant), the formula simplifies to:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)\nor\nT_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n(T₄ / T₂) = (a₄ / a₂)^(-1/2)\n\n**3. Combine the relationships to relate Temperature and Period**\nNow, we can substitute the expression for the ratio of semi-major axes from step 1 into the temperature ratio equation from step 2:\n(T₄ / T₂) = [ (P₄ / P₂)^(2/3) ]^(-1/2)\n(T₄ / T₂) = (P₄ / P₂)^((2/3) * (-1/2))\n(T₄ / T₂) = (P₄ / P₂)^(-1/3)\n\n**4. Calculate the final ratio**\nThe problem provides the ratio of orbital periods:\nP₁ : P₂ : P₃ : P₄ : P₅ = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5\n\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of the periods of Planet_4 and Planet_2:\nP₄ / P₂ = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature ratio:\nT₄ / T₂ = (1.75)^(-1/3)\nT₄ / T₂ = 1 / (1.75)^(1/3)\n\nLet's compute the value.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures\nperiod_ratio = 3.5 / 2\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(-1/3)\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.8302191834220268\n</execute_output>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.83.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T₄ / T₂).\n\n**2. Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\nT_eq = T_star * ( (1 - A) / 4 )^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / a)\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital radius for a circular orbit).\n\nFor two planets orbiting the same star (T_star and R_star are constant) and with the same albedo (A is constant), the formula simplifies to a proportionality:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)  or  T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\nT₄ / T₂ = (a₄ / a₂)^(-1/2)\n\n**3. Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period**\nKepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a).\nP² ∝ a³\n\nThis can be rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of the period:\na ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nSo, the ratio of the semi-major axes of Planet_4 and Planet_2 can be written in terms of their orbital periods:\na₄ / a₂ = (P₄ / P₂)^(2/3)\n\n**4. Combine the Relationships**\nNow, we can substitute the expression for the ratio of semi-major axes (from step 3) into the temperature ratio equation (from step 2):\nT₄ / T₂ = [ (P₄ / P₂)^(2/3) ]^(-1/2)\n\nUsing the rules of exponents ((x^m)^n = x^(m*n)), we can simplify this to:\nT₄ / T₂ = (P₄ / P₂)^((2/3) * (-1/2))\nT₄ / T₂ = (P₄ / P₂)^(-1/3)\n\n**5. Calculate the Numerical Value**\nThe problem provides the ratio of orbital periods:\nP₁ : P₂ : P₃ : P₄ : P₅ = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5\n\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of the periods for Planet_4 and Planet_2:\nP₄ / P₂ = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75\n\nNow, plug this value into our final equation:\nT₄ / T₂ = (1.75)^(-1/3)\n\nLet's compute this value using Python.\n```python\n# The ratio of the orbital periods of Planet_4 to Planet_2\nperiod_ratio = 3.5 / 2\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is the period ratio to the power of -1/3\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(-1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.8302191834220268\n</execute_output>\nThe calculated temperature ratio is approximately 0.8302.\n\n**6.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which is expressed as T₄ / T₂.\n\n**2. Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the energy it absorbs from its host star. For a planet in a circular orbit, this energy is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital radius (a). The formula for equilibrium temperature shows this relationship:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a  or  T_eq ∝ a⁻¹ᐟ²\n\nThis proportionality holds true because both planets orbit the same star (so the star's properties like temperature and radius are constant) and they have the same albedo (as stated in the problem).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 can be written as:\nT₄ / T₂ = (a₄ / a₂)⁻¹ᐟ²\n\n**3. Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period**\nKepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion provides the relationship between the orbital period (P) and the semi-major axis (a), which is the orbital radius for a circular orbit. The law states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\nP² ∝ a³\n\nWe can rearrange this to express the orbital radius in terms of the period:\na ∝ P²ᐟ³\n\nUsing this, we can write the ratio of the orbital radii for Planet_4 and Planet_2 in terms of their orbital periods:\na₄ / a₂ = (P₄ / P₂) ²ᐟ³\n\n**4. Combine the Relationships to Find the Temperature Ratio**\nNow, we substitute the expression for the ratio of radii (from Step 3) into the temperature ratio equation (from Step 2):\nT₄ / T₂ = [ (P₄ / P₂) ²ᐟ³ ]⁻¹ᐟ²\n\nUsing the power rule for exponents, (xᵐ)ⁿ = xᵐⁿ, we multiply the exponents:\nT₄ / T₂ = (P₄ / P₂)⁽²ᐟ³⁾ * ⁽⁻¹ᐟ²⁾\nT₄ / T₂ = (P₄ / P₂)⁻¹ᐟ³\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Value**\nThe problem gives the ratio of the orbital periods for the five planets as:\nP₁ : P₂ : P₃ : P₄ : P₅ = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5\n\nFrom this, we can find the specific ratio of the periods for Planet_4 and Planet_2:\nP₄ / P₂ = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75\n\nNow, we plug this value into our final equation from Step 4:\nT₄ / T₂ = (1.75)⁻¹ᐟ³\n\nTo get the numerical result, we can use a calculator.\n```python\n# The ratio of the orbital periods of Planet_4 to Planet_2.\nperiod_ratio = 3.5 / 2\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is the period ratio raised to the power of -1/3.\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(-1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.8302191834220268\n</execute_output>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.8302.\n\n**6.

The logic is sound and the result is consistent.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Relationships**:\n    *   The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (a): T_eq ∝ a⁻¹ᐟ².\n    *   According to Kepler's Third Law, the orbital distance (a) is proportional to the orbital period (P) raised to the power of 2/3: a ∝ P²ᐟ³.\n\n2.  **Combined Proportionality**: By combining these two relationships, we can find how temperature relates to the orbital period:\n    *   T_eq ∝ (P²ᐟ³)⁻¹ᐟ² = P⁻¹ᐟ³\n\n3.  **Ratio Calculation**: Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n    *   T₄ / T₂ = (P₄ / P₂)⁻¹ᐟ³\n\n4.  **Numerical Substitution**: The problem gives the ratio of periods as P₂ : P₄ = 2 : 3.5.\n    *   P₄ / P₂ = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75\n    *   T₄ / T₂ = (1.75)⁻¹ᐟ³\n\n5.  **Final Result**:\n    *   T₄ / T₂ ≈ 0.8302\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<B>>>"
