    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclohexanone (a cyclic ketone) and Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. The reaction occurs at the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon). Cyclohexanone has two equivalent α-carbons (C2 and C6), so the bromination will occur on one of them.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Structure of Product 1:**\nA six-membered ring with a ketone group (=O) and a bromine atom (Br) on the adjacent carbon.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone and Sodium Hydroxide (a strong base).\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents acting on an α-halo ketone points towards the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n*   **Mechanism of Favorskii Rearrangement:**\n    1.  The strong base (OH⁻) removes an acidic proton from the other α-carbon (C6), which is α' to the bromine. This forms an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate anion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻). This forms a strained bicyclic intermediate: bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one.\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the bicyclic intermediate.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the strained cyclopropane ring opens. The bond cleavage occurs to form the more stable carbanion. This results in the formation of a five-membered ring (cyclopentane ring) with a carboxylate group.\n    5.  Protonation during workup (from water) gives the final product.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   *Note:* An alternative reaction is elimination to form cyclohex-2-enone. However, the subsequent reaction steps strongly support the Favorskii rearrangement pathway. The reagents in steps 3 and 4 are classic for converting a carboxylic acid to an aldehyde.\n\n**Structure of Product 2:**\nA five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid and thionyl chloride (SOCl₂). Pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride). The -OH of the carboxyl group is replaced by -Cl.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Structure of Product 3:**\nA five-membered ring with an acyl chloride group (-COCl) attached.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride and Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.\n*   **Reaction:** LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. Its primary use in organic synthesis is the selective reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes. It is not strong enough to further reduce the aldehyde to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Structure of Product 4:**\nA five-membered ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nThe final product is **Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. Now we need to determine how many unique hydrogen environments exist in this molecule.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a C₅H₉ ring attached to a CHO group. The total number of hydrogens is 10.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (a Cₛ plane) that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C-H bond on the ring carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n*   **Identifying Equivalent Hydrogens:** Hydrogens that can be interchanged by this plane of symmetry are chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's count the distinct sets of hydrogens:\n1.  **The aldehyde hydrogen (-CHO):** This hydrogen is unique. (1st distinct type)\n2.  **The hydrogen on C1:** This is the carbon of the ring attached to the aldehyde group. This single hydrogen lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (2nd distinct type)\n3.  **The hydrogens on C2 and C5:** These two -CH₂- groups are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, within each CH₂ group, the two hydrogens are diastereotopic (one is 'cis' to the aldehyde group, one is 'trans'). They are not equivalent to each other.\n    *   The two 'cis' hydrogens (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other. (3rd distinct type)\n    *   The two 'trans' hydrogens (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other. (4th distinct type)\n4.  **The hydrogens on C3 and C4:** These two -CH₂- groups are also equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Like the C2/C5 positions, the two hydrogens on each carbon are diastereotopic.\n    *   The two 'cis' hydrogens (one on C3, one on C4) are equivalent to each other. (5th distinct type)\n    *   The two 'trans' hydrogens (one on C3, one on C4) are equivalent to each other. (6th distinct type)\n\nIn total, we have 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe six distinct sets are:\n1.  Aldehyde H (1H)\n2.  C1 methine H (1H)\n3.  C2/C5 cis H's (2H)\n4.  C2/C5 trans H's (2H)\n5.  C3/C4 cis H's (2H)\n6.  C3/C4 trans H's (2H)\n\n<<<D>>>"
