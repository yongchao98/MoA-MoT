    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify Substance X:**\n\n    *   **\"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\"**: This is a strong hint towards a deuterated compound, where Deuterium (D or ²H) replaces Hydrogen (H or ¹H).\n\n    *   **\"reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\"**:\n        *   Let's identify Gas W. We need a simple molecule where the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons.\n            *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n            *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (Yes)\n            *   HF: H (1p, 0n) + F (9p, 10n) = 10 protons, 10 neutrons. (Yes)\n            *   N₂: Each N (7p, 7n) = 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Yes)\n            *   CO: C (6p, 6n) + O (8p, 8n) = 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   Given the first clue about a heavier isotope, D₂ is the most likely candidate for Gas W. This implies that Substance X is a deuteride. The violent reaction suggests liquid Y is likely water (H₂O).\n\n    *   **\"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\"**: This points towards a common reagent. If X is a deuteride, a very common analog would be a hydride. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is an extremely common and powerful reducing agent. Its deuterated analog is lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄). This fits perfectly.\n\n    *   **\"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\"**:\n        *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits this clue.\n        *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (R-CO-R') and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It has at least 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   LiAlD₄ (like LiAlH₄) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both functional groups to alcohols.\n        *   Ketone (C=O) is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-CD(OH)-).\n        *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CD₂OH).\n        *   The final product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups, -OH). A diol contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms. This clue strongly supports X being LiAlD₄.\n\n    *   **\"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K\"**:\n        *   Let's write the reaction of X (LiAlD₄) with Y (H₂O):\n            `LiAlD₄ + 4H₂O → LiOH(aq) + Al(OH)₃(s) + 4D₂(g)`\n        *   In this reaction, the gas W is D₂, which we already established.\n        *   A precipitate G, aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃), is formed. This fits.\n        *   When precipitate G (Al(OH)₃) is heated, it decomposes:\n            `2Al(OH)₃(s) → Al₂O₃(s) + 3H₂O(g)`\n        *   The reaction *releases* a substance B. So, B is water (H₂O).\n        *   The melting point of water is 0°C, which is 273.15 K. The clue states the melting point of B is \"very close to 277 K\" (4°C). This is a reasonable approximation for a puzzle-style question (it might also be an oblique reference to the temperature of water's maximum density).\n\n2.  **Conclusion on Substance X:**\n    All clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   First, identify the elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄):\n        *   Lithium (Li), Atomic Number (Z) = 3\n        *   Aluminum (Al), Atomic Number (Z) = 13\n        *   Hydrogen (H), represented by its isotope Deuterium (D), Atomic Number (Z) = 1\n    *   Identify the lightest and heaviest elements based on their atomic number (Z):\n        *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (Z=1)\n        *   Heaviest element: Aluminum (Z=13)\n    *   Calculate the total mass for each of these elements in the molecule using integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes present.\n        *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n          Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n        *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum. The stable isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n          Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   Calculate the cumulative (summed) mass:\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass from Hydrogen isotopes) + (Mass from Aluminum isotopes)\n        *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
