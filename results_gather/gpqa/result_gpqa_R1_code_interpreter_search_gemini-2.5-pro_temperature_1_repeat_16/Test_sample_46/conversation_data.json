    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as:\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional degree of unsaturation, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** These two medium-to-strong bands are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is too high for a simple amide (which is typically < 1690 cm-1) but is perfect for an ester group that is conjugated with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR).\n\n**3. 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** A methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** This indicates it is adjacent to a -CH2- group (n+1 = 2+1 = 3 peaks). This suggests an ethyl group fragment (-CH2CH3).\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** A methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** This indicates it is adjacent to a -CH3 group (n+1 = 3+1 = 4 peaks). This confirms the ethyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH2- group, which is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH2-).\n\n*   **Combining the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm, we can confidently identify an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).**\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** This is typical for exchangeable protons, such as those on an amine (-NH2) or alcohol (-OH). Combined with the IR data showing N-H stretches, this signal is assigned to the two protons of the primary amine group (-NH2).\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** Four protons in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Chemical Shift & Splitting:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt).\n    *   The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-donating amine group (-NH2).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   We have a benzene ring.\n*   It is 1,4- (para) disubstituted.\n*   The two substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verifying the Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all spectral data and the molecular formula (C9H11NO2). This is the correct structure.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group is part of a propionyl group (-COCH2CH3). The -CH2- group would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm-1. It also has a formyl proton (-CHO) and an amide N-H proton, which do not match the NMR spectrum.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide (inconsistent IR) and is meta-substituted, which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern in the NMR, not two doublets.\n\nTherefore, the only compound that fits all the evidence is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
