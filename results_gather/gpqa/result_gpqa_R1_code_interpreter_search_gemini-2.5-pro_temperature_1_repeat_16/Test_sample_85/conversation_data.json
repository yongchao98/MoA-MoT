    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this name:\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered heterocyclic ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro-**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: A carbonyl group (C=O) is at position 2 of the ring. This makes the molecule a lactone (a cyclic ester). The ring oxygen is numbered as position 1.\n*   **4-ethyl-**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to carbon 4 of the ring.\n*   **(R)- or (S)-**: This denotes the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is carbon-4 (the carbon atom bearing the ethyl group).\n\nThe structure is a delta-lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options suggest the starting material is a derivative of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's deduce its structure:\n*   **pentanoic acid**: A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) as the principal functional group. The carbons are numbered starting from the carboxylic acid carbon (C1).\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group is on C3.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This indicates that at C5, there is an ester group: -C(=O)O-isobutyl.\n\nSo, the structure is:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-isobutyl`\n\nThis molecule has two functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester. It has one chiral center at C3, the carbon atom with the ethyl group. The starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this compound.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group reacts much more slowly.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the ester group (-COOiBu) of compound A to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) remains unchanged.\n        `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`  ---(LiBH₄)--> `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n        The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl (-OH) group at C5 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid at C1 to form a stable six-membered ring (the delta-lactone).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** In this entire sequence, the bonds to the chiral center (C3 of the starting material) are not broken. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. The C3 of the starting acid becomes the C4 of the final lactone product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of compound B to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The ester group (-COOiBu) remains unchanged.\n        `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` ---(BH₃)--> `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`\n        The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl (-OH) group attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) and forming the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in Reaction 1, the bonds to the chiral center (C3 of the starting material) are not affected during the reaction sequence. The stereochemistry is retained. C3 of the starting material becomes C4 of the lactone product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A is the (R)-enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
