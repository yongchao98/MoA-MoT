    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted reaction.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and Reaction\n\n*   **Initial State:** A bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S(initial) = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation for L=0) implies the orbital angular momentum `L(initial) = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum `J(initial) = 0`.\n*   **Reaction:** The initial NN system emits a particle X: `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   It has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s, p, d, f...`) denotes its orbital angular momentum state, `L(X)`. So, `s` means `L(X)=0`, `p` means `L(X)=1`, `f` means `L(X)=3`.\n    *   We will assume particle X has no spin (`S(X)=0`), so its total angular momentum is `J(X) = L(X)`. This is a standard assumption in such problems unless specified otherwise.\n*   **Final NN State:**\n    *   The problem specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN final) = 0`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Relevant Conservation Laws and Principles\n\nFor a reaction to be permitted, it must satisfy all relevant physical laws. The key ones here are:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** As nucleons are identical fermions, the total wavefunction of the two-nucleon system must be antisymmetric under their exchange.\n\n### 3. Formulate the Conditions for a Permitted Reaction\n\nLet's translate the laws into specific conditions for this problem. Let `S_f`, `L_f`, and `J_f` be the quantum numbers for the final NN state.\n\n1.  **J-Conservation:**\n    *   `J(initial) = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's angular momentum (`J(X) = L(X)`).\n    *   `vec(J(initial)) = vec(J_f) + vec(J(X))`\n    *   `vec(0) = vec(J_f) + vec(L_X)`\n    *   This implies that the vectors must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. For the quantum numbers, this means their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = L(X)`.\n\n2.  **Parity Conservation:**\n    *   The parity of a system is given by `P = P_intrinsic * (-1)^L`. For a two-nucleon system, the intrinsic parity is `(+1)*(+1)=+1`.\n    *   `P(initial) = P(NN, 1S0) = (-1)^L(initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   `P(final) = P(NN, final) * P(X, intrinsic) * P(X, orbital)`\n    *   `P(final) = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^L(X) = (-1)^(L_f + L(X) + 1)`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved, `P(initial) = P(final)`, so `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + L(X) + 1)`.\n    *   This requires the exponent `L_f + L(X) + 1` to be an even number, which means `L_f + L(X)` must be **odd**.\n\n3.  **Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:**\n    *   The problem states the condition as `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is equivalent to the standard requirement that `L+S+T` must be odd for a two-nucleon system.\n    *   We are given that the final NN state has `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Plugging this into the condition: `L_f + S_f + 0` must be odd.\n    *   Therefore, `L_f + S_f` must be **odd**.\n\n### 4. Test Each Option Against the Conditions\n\nA reaction is forbidden if it fails even one of these three conditions.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f=3`, `L_f=2` (D-state), `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `L(X)=1`.\n*   1. **J-Conservation:** `J_f = L(X)`? -> `1 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   2. **Parity:** `L_f + L(X)` is odd? -> `2 + 1 = 3`. (Pass)\n*   3. **Pauli:** `L_f + S_f` is odd? -> `2 + 3 = 5`. (Pass)\n*   This reaction is **permitted**.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0` (S-state), `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `L(X)=1`.\n*   1. **J-Conservation:** `J_f = L(X)`? -> `1 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   2. **Parity:** `L_f + L(X)` is odd? -> `0 + 1 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   3. **Pauli:** `L_f + S_f` is odd? -> `0 + 1 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   This reaction is **permitted**.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2` (D-state), `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `L(X)=3`.\n*   1. **J-Conservation:** `J_f = L(X)`? -> `3 = 3`. (Pass)\n*   2. **Parity:** `L_f + L(X)` is odd? -> `2 + 3 = 5`. (Pass)\n*   3. **Pauli:** `L_f + S_f` is odd? -> `2 + 1 = 3`. (Pass)\n*   This reaction is **permitted**.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1` (P-state), `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `L(X)=0`.\n*   1. **J-Conservation:** `J_f = L(X)`? -> `0 = 0`. (Pass)\n*   2. **Parity:** `L_f + L(X)` is odd? -> `1 + 0 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   3. **Pauli:** `L_f + S_f` is odd? -> `1 + 1 = 2`. (Fail)\n*   The sum `L_f + S_f` is even, which violates the Pauli exclusion principle for a two-nucleon state with `T_f = 0`. Therefore, the final state `NN(3P0)` with `T=0` cannot exist.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe reaction `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is not permitted because it requires the formation of a final `3P0` two-nucleon state with `T=0`, which is forbidden by the generalized Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n<<<D>>>"
