    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n1.  **Understanding Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of gas molecules per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area that a target particle presents for a collision.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Two Scenarios**\n    In both scenarios described, the conditions of the residual gas in the sample compartment (pressure, temperature, volume) are the same. This means the number density `n` of the gas molecules is constant. The only difference between the calculation of λ1 and λ2 is the nature of the collision, which affects the collision cross-section `σ`.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1: Calculating λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collision)**\n        *   Here, we are considering a gas molecule moving and colliding with other gas molecules.\n        *   Let's model the gas molecules as hard spheres with a radius `r`. A collision occurs when the center of one molecule comes within a distance of `2r` (the sum of the radii of the two identical molecules) of the center of another molecule.\n        *   Therefore, the collision cross-section, σ1, is the area of a circle with radius `2r`.\n        *   σ1 = π * (2r)² = 4πr²\n        *   So, the mean free path for gas-gas collisions is: **λ1 = 1 / (n * 4πr²)**\n\n    *   **Scenario 2: Calculating λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule Collision)**\n        *   Here, we are considering an electron from the beam moving and colliding with the gas molecules.\n        *   The size of an electron is negligible compared to the size of a gas molecule. We can treat the electron as a point particle.\n        *   A collision occurs when the electron comes within a distance of `r` (the radius of the gas molecule) of the center of the molecule.\n        *   Therefore, the collision cross-section, σ2, is the area of a circle with radius `r`.\n        *   σ2 = π * r²\n        *   So, the mean free path for electron-gas collisions is: **λ2 = 1 / (n * πr²)**\n\n3.  **Comparing λ1 and λ2**\n    Now we can find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * πr²)] / [1 / (n * 4πr²)]\n    λ2 / λ1 = (n * 4πr²) / (n * πr²)\n    λ2 / λ1 = 4\n\n    This means **λ2 = 4 * λ1**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    The mean free path for an electron scattering with gas molecules (λ2) is approximately four times longer than the mean free path for gas molecules scattering with each other (λ1). This is because the collision cross-section for an electron hitting a molecule is about four times smaller than that for two molecules hitting each other.\n\n    Let's evaluate the given options based on our result λ2 = 4 * λ1:\n    A) λ2 < λ1: False.\n    B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: False.\n    C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: True, since 4 is indeed greater than or equal to 1.22.\n    D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: False, since 4 is not less than 1.22.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
