    "This problem requires the application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between energy and momentum for a moving particle.\n\n**1. Identify the relevant physical principles:**\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (Position-Momentum):** This principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously know the exact position and momentum of a particle. The minimum uncertainty is given by the relation:\n    Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   Δx is the uncertainty in position.\n    *   Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** The energy (E) of a particle is related to its momentum (p). We need to find the relationship between the uncertainties, ΔE and Δp. This can be found by taking the derivative of energy with respect to momentum, dE/dp.\n\n**2. Analyze the particle's speed:**\n\n*   The electron's speed is v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s.\n*   The speed of light is c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s.\n*   Since the electron's speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (v = 2/3 c), we should use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n    E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n    where m₀ is the rest mass of the electron.\n\n**3. Derive the relationship between ΔE and Δp:**\n\nWe can find the relationship between small changes in energy (dE) and momentum (dp) by differentiating the energy-momentum equation with respect to p:\nd(E²)/dp = d/dp [ (pc)² + (m₀c²)² ]\n2E * (dE/dp) = 2p * c²\ndE/dp = (pc²) / E\n\nFrom relativistic dynamics, we also know that total energy E = γm₀c² and momentum p = γm₀v, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Substituting these into the expression for dE/dp:\ndE/dp = ( (γm₀v) * c² ) / (γm₀c²) = v\n\nThis gives us a simple relationship: dE = v * dp. For small uncertainties, we can approximate this as:\nΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\n**4. Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):**\n\nUsing the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for the minimum uncertainty:\nΔp_min = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\nGiven:\n*   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nΔp_min = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔp_min ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n**5. Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE):**\n\nNow, use the relationship ΔE ≈ v * Δp with the calculated minimum Δp:\nΔE_min ≈ v * Δp_min\nΔE_min ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\nΔE_min ≈ 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\nΔE_min ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThis value is on the order of 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\n# Constants\nv = 2e8  # speed of the electron in m/s\ndelta_x = 0.1e-9  # uncertainty in position in meters (0.1 nm)\nhbar = 1.054571817e-34  # reduced Planck constant in J.s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (delta_p)\n# Using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: delta_x * delta_p >= hbar / 2\n# Minimum uncertainty: delta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\ndelta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (delta_E)\n# The relationship between energy and momentum uncertainty is dE/dp = v\n# So, delta_E = v * delta_p\ndelta_E = v * delta_p\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"{delta_E:.3e} J\")\n```\n>>>\n1.055e-16 J\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 1.055 x 10⁻¹⁶ J. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n\nThe result clearly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the core principles:**\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle establishes a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, such as position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. For position (x) and momentum (p), the relationship is:\n    Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n    where Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** We need to find the relationship between the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). For a particle moving with velocity v, the change in energy with respect to momentum (dE/dp) is equal to its velocity (v).\n    dE/dp = v\n    For small uncertainties, we can approximate this as:\n    ΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\n**2. Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):**\n\nWe are looking for the *minimum* uncertainty, so we use the equality in the Heisenberg principle:\nΔp_min = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\nGiven:\n*   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nPlugging in the values:\nΔp_min = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔp_min ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n**3. Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE):**\n\nNow, use the relationship ΔE ≈ v * Δp with the minimum momentum uncertainty we just calculated.\n\nGiven:\n*   v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   Δp_min ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\nΔE_min ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\nΔE_min ≈ 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\nΔE_min ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n**4. Compare with the given options:**\n\nThe calculated value is ~1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n*   A) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n*   B) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n*   C) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n*   D) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n\nOur calculated value matches the order of magnitude of option C. The calculation performed by the code confirms this result precisely: `1.055e-16 J`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
