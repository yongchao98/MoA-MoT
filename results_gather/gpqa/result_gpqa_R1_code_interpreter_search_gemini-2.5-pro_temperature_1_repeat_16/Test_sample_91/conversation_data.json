    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the enthalpy of formation of the given compound.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Molar Mass**\n\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's count the number of Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H) atoms:\n*   **(CH3)2C=**: 3 C, 6 H\n*   **CH**: 1 C, 1 H\n*   **CH2**: 1 C, 2 H\n*   **CH(CH3)**: 2 C, 4 H\n*   **CH2**: 1 C, 2 H\n*   **CH**: 1 C, 1 H\n*   **=C(CH3)2**: 3 C, 6 H\n\nAdding these up:\n*   Total Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nThe molar mass of C12H22 is calculated as:\nMolar Mass = (12 × Atomic Mass of C) + (22 × Atomic Mass of H)\nMolar Mass ≈ (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nWe need to analyze the structure to count all the covalent bonds:\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds (`C=C`). So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: These are the single bonds between carbon atoms.\n    *   In `(CH3)2C=`: 2 C-C bonds connecting the two methyl groups.\n    *   In `=CH-CH2-`: 1 C-C bond.\n    *   In `-CH2-CH(CH3)-`: 1 C-C bond in the main chain and 1 C-C bond to the methyl branch. Total = 2.\n    *   In `-CH(CH3)-CH2-`: 1 C-C bond.\n    *   In `-CH2-CH=`: 1 C-C bond.\n    *   In `=C(CH3)2`: 2 C-C bonds connecting the two methyl groups.\n    *   Total C-C single bonds = 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atomization)**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound. We use the given bond energies:\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atomization = (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C))\nΔH_atomization = (22 × 400) + (2 × 300) + (9 × 200)\nΔH_atomization = 8800 + 600 + 1800\nΔH_atomization = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\n\nThe formation of the compound C12H22 occurs from its elements in their standard states: 12 C(s, graphite) and 11 H2(g). We need to calculate the energy required to convert these into gaseous atoms: 12 C(g) and 22 H(g).\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of Carbon (C(s) → C(g)) = 1000 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of H-H (H2(g) → 2H(g)) = 100 kJ/mol\n\nTotal Enthalpy = (No. of C atoms × ΔH_atom(C)) + (No. of H2 molecules × BE(H-H))\nTotal Enthalpy = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\nTotal Enthalpy = 12000 + 1100\nTotal Enthalpy = **13100 kJ/mol**\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation of the compound can be found using Hess's Law:\nΔH_f = (Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Enthalpy of atomization of the compound)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔH_f = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### **Step 6: Convert the Answer to the Required Units (kJ/g)**\n\nThe options include answers in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. Let's convert our result to kJ/g to compare with the options.\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol\nΔH_f (kJ/g) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 11.44 kJ/g\nB) 1900 kJ/g\nC) 67.4 kJ/mol\nD) 11200 kJ/mol\n\nOur calculated value of 11.44 kJ/g matches option A exactly. Option D is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, and Option B uses the correct value for the enthalpy of formation but with incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol).\n\n```python\n# Given values\nBE_CH = 400  # Bond energy of C-H in kJ/mol\nBE_CC_single = 200  # Bond energy of C-C in kJ/mol\nBE_CC_double = 300  # Bond energy of C=C in kJ/mol\nBE_HH = 100  # Bond energy of H-H in kJ/mol\ndH_atom_C = 1000  # Enthalpy of atomization of Carbon in kJ/mol\n\n# Molecular formula: C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Number of bonds in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\nnum_CC_single_bonds = 9\nnum_CC_double_bonds = 2\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the compound\ndH_atomization_compound = (num_CH_bonds * BE_CH) + \\\n                          (num_CC_single_bonds * BE_CC_single) + \\\n                          (num_CC_double_bonds * BE_CC_double)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the enthalpy of formation of the gaseous atoms from standard states\n# Formation reaction: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22(g)\n# Reactants need to be atomized: 12 C(s) -> 12 C(g) and 11 H2(g) -> 22 H(g)\ndH_atomization_reactants = (num_C * dH_atom_C) + ((num_H / 2) * BE_HH)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound\n# dH_f = dH_atomization_reactants - dH_atomization_compound\ndH_f_mol = dH_atomization_reactants - dH_atomization_compound\n\n# Step 4: Convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g\n# Molar mass of C12H22 = 12*12.011 + 22*1.008 ≈ 166.3 g/mol\n# Using integer masses for simplicity as per problem's likely intent\nmolar_mass = 12 * 12 + 22 * 1  # 166 g/mol\ndH_f_gram = dH_f_mol / molar_mass\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): {dH_f_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): {dH_f_gram}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
