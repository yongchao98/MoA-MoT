    "Eradicating an anti-nutritional compound requires disrupting the function of the enzyme that synthesizes it. The most effective way to achieve this is to introduce a mutation that prevents the formation of a functional protein. This is typically accomplished by creating a truncated, non-functional protein. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein sequence.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. This means we are looking for a mutation that will knock out the function of the gene. The most definitive way to do this is to introduce a **nonsense mutation** (a premature stop codon) or a **frameshift mutation** (an insertion or deletion that scrambles the entire downstream amino acid sequence). A **missense mutation** (changing a single amino acid) might reduce or alter function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it entirely.\n\n### **2. Analyzing the Intact Gene**\n\nFirst, let's translate the beginning of the intact gene's coding sequence. The sequence is read in groups of three nucleotides, called codons.\n*   **Intact Gene:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...-3’\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start codon)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine\n    *   ...and so on.\n\nThe resulting protein starts with: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...\n\n### **3. Evaluating Each Mutant**\n\nNow, let's examine each mutant sequence to see how the mutation affects the protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   Changes: The second codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and the third codon `CTC` becomes `TAC`.\n    *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: Both codons code for Phenylalanine. This is a **silent mutation**.\n    *   `CTC` -> `TAC`: `CTC` codes for Leucine, while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine. This is a **missense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** The final protein will have one amino acid changed (Leucine to Tyrosine). This might affect the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   Changes: The second codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and the third codon `CTC` becomes `TAA`.\n    *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: This is a silent mutation (Phenylalanine).\n    *   `CTC` -> `TAA`: `CTC` codes for Leucine, but `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The cell's machinery will stop protein synthesis at this new, premature stop codon. The result is a tiny, truncated peptide of only two amino acids (Met-Phe). This peptide will be completely non-functional. This mutation will almost certainly eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT...-3’ (There appears to be an error in the provided Mutant 3 sequence, as it's identical to Mutant 4. Assuming the intended comparison is with Mutant 4)\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’\n    *   Change: The third codon `CTC` is changed to `TAC`.\n    *   `CTC` -> `TAC`: `CTC` codes for Leucine, while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine. This is a **missense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** This mutation results in a single amino acid change, identical to the missense portion of Mutant 1. As with Mutant 1, this is less likely to completely eliminate the compound's production than a nonsense mutation.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nComparing the four options, Mutant 2 is the only one that introduces a premature stop codon. This **nonsense mutation** will halt protein production almost immediately, leading to a non-functional protein and, consequently, the elimination of the anti-nutritional compound. The other mutations result in changes to one or two amino acids, which might not be sufficient to destroy the protein's function. Therefore, Mutant 2 provides the highest probability of achieving the desired outcome.\n\n<<<B>>>"
