    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics Principle:** The problem involves the decay of relativistic particles. The key concepts are:\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial population `N₀` after a time `t` is given by N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/τ), where `τ` is the mean lifetime.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** For a particle moving at a relativistic speed, its internal clock runs slower as observed from a stationary frame (the lab/detector frame). The lifetime of the particle in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is dilated by the Lorentz factor `γ` compared to its proper lifetime (`τ_proper`): `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equation:**\n    *   The time it takes for a particle to travel the detector radius `r` in the lab frame is `t_lab = r / v`, where `v` is the particle's velocity.\n    *   The decay law in the lab frame is: `N = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`.\n    *   Substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`, we get: `N = N₀ * exp(-(r / v) / (γ * τ_proper))`.\n    *   The fraction of particles reaching the detector is `N/N₀`:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-r / (v * γ * τ_proper))`\n    *   Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is extremely close to the speed of light `c`. So we can approximate `v ≈ c`.\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-r / (c * γ * τ_proper))`\n\n3.  **Use the Initial Conditions:**\n    *   We are given that for the first case (let's use subscript 1), `γ₁ = 20` and the fraction of surviving particles is `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`.\n    *   Plugging these values into the equation:\n        `1/3 = exp(-r / (c * γ₁ * τ_proper))`\n        `1/3 = exp(-r / (c * 20 * τ_proper))`\n    *   To solve for the unknown constants, let's take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -r / (c * 20 * τ_proper)`\n        `-ln(3) = -r / (c * 20 * τ_proper)`\n        `ln(3) = r / (c * 20 * τ_proper)`\n    *   This equation relates the known quantities to the constant term `r / (c * τ_proper)`, which depends on the detector size and the particle's intrinsic properties. We can rearrange it as: `20 * ln(3) = r / (c * τ_proper)`.\n\n4.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor:**\n    *   For the second case (subscript 2), we want the fraction of surviving particles to be `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`. We need to find the required Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    *   The equation for this case is:\n        `2/3 = exp(-r / (c * γ₂ * τ_proper))`\n    *   Again, taking the natural logarithm:\n        `ln(2/3) = -r / (c * γ₂ * τ_proper)`\n        `-ln(3/2) = -r / (c * γ₂ * τ_proper)`\n        `ln(3/2) = r / (c * γ₂ * τ_proper)`\n    *   Rearranging gives: `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = r / (c * τ_proper)`.\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    *   We now have two expressions for the same constant `r / (c * τ_proper)`:\n        1.  `20 * ln(3) = r / (c * τ_proper)`\n        2.  `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = r / (c * τ_proper)`\n    *   We can set them equal to each other:\n        `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    *   Now, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Result:**\n    To get a precise numerical value, we can use a simple python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given Lorentz factor\ngamma1 = 20\n\n# We derived the formula: gamma2 = gamma1 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n# where ln is the natural logarithm.\ngamma2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\n\nprint(gamma2)\n```\n\nThe calculation yields a value of approximately 54.19. This is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem relates the survival fraction of relativistic particles to their Lorentz factor. The key physics principles are exponential decay and time dilation.\n\n**1. Model the Particle Decay:**\nThe fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that survive after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_mean)`\nwhere `τ_mean` is the mean lifetime of the particles as measured in the observer's frame (the lab frame).\n\n**2. Incorporate Time Dilation:**\nFor relativistic particles, the mean lifetime measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is dilated by the Lorentz factor `γ` compared to their proper lifetime `τ_proper` (the lifetime in their own rest frame).\n`τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`\n\n**3. Determine the Time of Flight:**\nThe particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. The time it takes for them to travel from the center to the detector wall of radius `r` is:\n`t = r / v ≈ r / c`\n\n**4. Combine the Equations:**\nSubstituting the expressions for `t` and `τ_lab` into the decay equation gives the fraction of particles reaching the detector:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-(r/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\nThis can be written as:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-C / γ)`\nwhere `C = r / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant that depends on the experimental setup (detector radius `r`) and the intrinsic properties of the particle (`τ_proper`), but not on the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n\n**5. Use the Initial Condition to find the constant C:**\nWe are given that when `γ₁ = 20`, the survival fraction is `N/N₀ = 1/3`.\n`1/3 = exp(-C / 20)`\nTo solve for `C`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -C / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -C / 20`\n`C = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**6. Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\nWe want to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` required for `2/3` of the particles to reach the detector.\n`2/3 = exp(-C / γ₂)`\nAgain, take the natural logarithm:\n`ln(2/3) = -C / γ₂`\n`-ln(3/2) = -C / γ₂`\n`γ₂ = C / ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, substitute the value of `C` we found in the previous step:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Value:**\nUsing the values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n`γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis calculated value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
