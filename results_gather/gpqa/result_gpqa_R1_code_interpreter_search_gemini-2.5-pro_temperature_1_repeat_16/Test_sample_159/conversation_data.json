    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Geometry of the Aperture:**\n    *   The aperture is a regular N-sided polygon.\n    *   A key piece of information is that all apothems are of the same length, 'a'. The apothem is the line segment from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of a side. It is also the radius of the inscribed circle.\n    *   The question states that N is infinitely large (N → ∞).\n    *   Let's consider what happens to a regular N-sided polygon as N → ∞. The number of sides increases, and the length of each side decreases. The polygon will approximate a smooth curve.\n    *   For a regular N-sided polygon, the relationship between the apothem 'a' and the circumradius 'R' (distance from the center to a vertex) is `a = R * cos(π/N)`.\n    *   As N → ∞, the angle `π/N` approaches 0. Since `cos(0) = 1`, the relationship becomes `a = R * cos(0)`, which means `a = R`.\n    *   When the apothem equals the circumradius, the inscribed and circumscribed circles are the same. This means the N-sided polygon becomes a circle.\n    *   Therefore, for N → ∞, the aperture is a circle with radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physics Principle:**\n    *   The problem describes the diffraction of monochromatic light by an aperture in the far-field region. This is known as Fraunhofer diffraction.\n    *   For a circular aperture, the resulting diffraction pattern is called an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Condition for Minima:**\n    *   The intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture of radius 'a' is given by:\n        `I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]²`\n        where:\n        *   `θ` is the angular distance from the central axis.\n        *   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n        *   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one.\n        *   `I₀` is the intensity at the center (θ = 0).\n    *   The intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator `J₁(k * a * sin(θ))` is equal to zero (while the denominator is non-zero).\n    *   So, the condition for the m-th minimum is:\n        `k * a * sin(θ_m) = j_{1,m}`\n        where `j_{1,m}` is the m-th root (or zero) of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\n4.  **Find the Zeros of the Bessel Function:**\n    *   We need the first two zeros of the `J₁` Bessel function to find the positions of the first two minima. These are well-known mathematical constants.\n    *   First zero, `j_{1,1} ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero, `j_{1,2} ≈ 7.0156`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Positions of the Minima:**\n    *   Substitute the values of `j_{1,m}` and `k` into the condition for minima.\n    *   For the first minimum (m=1):\n        `(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ₁) = j_{1,1} ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   For the second minimum (m=2):\n        `(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ₂) = j_{1,2} ≈ 7.0156`\n    *   The problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n    *   Angular position of the first minimum:\n        `θ₁ ≈ (j_{1,1} / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n    *   Angular position of the second minimum:\n        `θ₂ ≈ (j_{1,2} / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:**\n    *   The angular distance between the first two minima is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    *   `Δθ ≈ [(j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) / (2π)] * (λ / a)`\n    *   `Δθ ≈ [(7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π)] * (λ / a)`\n    *   `Δθ ≈ [3.1839 / (2π)] * (λ / a)`\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Numerical Value:**\n    *   To find the numerical coefficient, we calculate `3.1839 / (2π)`. We can use a python script for better precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Zeros of the Bessel function J1(x)\nj1_1 = 3.83170597\nj1_2 = 7.01558667\n\n# The angular position of the m-th minimum is given by theta_m = (j1_m / (2*pi)) * (lambda / a)\n# We need to find the coefficient for the angular distance Delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1\n\n# Coefficient for theta_1\ncoeff_1 = j1_1 / (2 * np.pi)\n\n# Coefficient for theta_2\ncoeff_2 = j1_2 / (2 * np.pi)\n\n# Coefficient for the angular distance Delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1\ndelta_coeff = coeff_2 - coeff_1\n\n# We can also calculate it directly\n# delta_coeff = (j1_2 - j1_1) / (2 * np.pi)\n\nprint(f\"Coefficient for the first minimum (theta_1): {coeff_1:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Coefficient for the second minimum (theta_2): {coeff_2:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Coefficient for the angular distance (Delta_theta): {delta_coeff:.4f}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nCoefficient for the first minimum (theta_1): 0.6098\nCoefficient for the second minimum (theta_2): 1.1166\nCoefficient for the angular distance (Delta_theta): 0.5068\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculation shows that the coefficient for the angular distance `Δθ` is approximately `0.5068`.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 0.500 λ / a\n    *   B) 0.610 λ / a (This is the approximate position of the *first* minimum, `θ₁`)\n    *   C) 1.220 λ / a (This is related to the diameter and the first minimum, `1.22 = 2 * 0.61`)\n    *   D) 0.506 λ / a\n\nOur calculated result `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)` is a very close match to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "An N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circle of radius 'a' as the number of sides N approaches infinity. This is because the relationship between the apothem 'a' and the circumradius 'R' (the distance from the center to a vertex) for a regular N-sided polygon is `a = R * cos(π/N)`. As N → ∞, `cos(π/N) → cos(0) = 1`, which implies that `a → R`. Thus, the aperture becomes a circle of radius 'a'.\n\nThe problem now simplifies to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'. The intensity distribution for such an aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The angular positions of the intensity minima (dark rings) are given by the condition:\n\n`sin(θ) = j_{1,m} / (k * a)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `θ` is the angular distance from the central axis.\n*   `j_{1,m}` is the m-th zero of the Bessel function of the first kind, `J₁(x)`.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n\nSubstituting `k = 2π / λ` and using the small-angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`, the condition for the m-th minimum becomes:\n\n`θ_m ≈ (j_{1,m} * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\nWe need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which corresponds to `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\nThe first two zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)` are:\n*   `j_{1,1} ≈ 3.8317` (for the first minimum)\n*   `j_{1,2} ≈ 7.0156` (for the second minimum)\n\nNow we can calculate the angular positions:\n*   `θ₁ ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n*   `θ₂ ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\nThe angular distance between them is:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\nAlternatively, `Δθ = (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) * λ / (2π * a) = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π * a) = 3.1839 * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`.\n\nThe python script executed in the previous step confirms this calculation, giving a coefficient of 0.5067.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 0.610 λ / a\nC) 1.220 λ /a\nD) 0.506 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5068 * (λ / a)` is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
