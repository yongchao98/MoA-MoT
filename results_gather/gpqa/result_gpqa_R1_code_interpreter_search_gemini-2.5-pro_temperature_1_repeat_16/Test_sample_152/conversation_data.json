These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nA) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\nB) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\nC) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\nD) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Dimethyl malonate (`CH₂(COOCH₃)₂`) + Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (`p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`)\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium ethoxide (`NaOEt`) in ethanol (`EtOH`).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Sodium ethoxide is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate. The resulting proton is highly acidic because the negative charge on the conjugate base (the enolate) is stabilized by resonance across two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n        `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt → Na⁺ ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + EtOH`\n        The nucleophile is the malonate enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the carbon atom of the C=C double bond that is further from the ester group) is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group. The structure is `p-tolyl-C³H=C²H-C¹(=O)OCH₃`. The β-carbon is C3.\n    3.  **Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon (C3) of the acrylate. The π-electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon (C2), and the carbonyl π-electrons shift to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate. This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol) at the α-carbon to yield the final product.\n        *   **Attack:** `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of `p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`.\n        *   **Bond Formation:** A new C-C bond forms between the carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n        *   **Product Structure:** `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    4.  **Naming Product (A):** The product is a tri-ester. To name it according to the options, we identify a three-carbon \"propane\" backbone `C1-C2-C3`.\n        *   `C1` is the carbon from the malonate: `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-`.\n        *   `C2` is the β-carbon from the acrylate, now bonded to `C1` and bearing the p-tolyl group: `-CH(p-tolyl)-`.\n        *   `C3` is the α-carbon from the acrylate, which gets protonated: `-CH₂-`, bonded to the original ester group.\n        *   Putting it together and including the third ester group gives the structure: `(CH₃OOC)₂CH¹-CH²(p-tolyl)-CH₂³-COOCH₃`.\n        *   This corresponds to the IUPAC-based name **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`)\n*   **Reagents:** Methanol (`MeOH`) followed by acidic workup (`H₃O⁺`).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, which utilizes an enamine as the nucleophile in a Michael addition.\n    1.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C=C carbon not bonded to the nitrogen). The lone pair on the nitrogen pushes electron density into the ring, making the β-carbon act like a carbanion.\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`), also known as crotononitrile, is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the electrophilic center.\n    3.  **Reaction:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and generates an iminium ion intermediate. The acidic workup (`H₃O⁺`) serves two purposes: it protonates the nitrile intermediate and, crucially, it hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n        *   **Attack:** The enamine attacks `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`.\n        *   **Resulting Alkyl Group:** The fragment added to the cyclohexanone ring is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n        *   **Hydrolysis:** The enamine functionality is converted back to a ketone (cyclohexanone). The alkyl group is attached at the α-position (C2) of the original ketone.\n    4.  **Naming Product (B):** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at the C2 position.\n        *   Naming this as a substituted butanenitrile (where the nitrile carbon is C1): `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(substituent)-C⁴H₃`.\n        *   The substituent on C3 is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n        *   Therefore, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major, most stable product, not the enol (`-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl`).\n\n### **Reaction C**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Reactant `C` + but-3-en-2-one (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`)\n*   **Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (`KOH`) in water (`H₂O`).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a retrospective analysis (retrosynthesis) to find the starting Michael donor (`C`).\n    1.  **Identify Fragments:** The product, 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, is formed by joining two molecules. We can identify these by cleaving the bond formed during the Michael addition.\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor:** The problem states that but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK) is one of the reactants. In the product, this corresponds to the \"3-oxobutyl\" side chain (`-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`). This group is formed by adding a nucleophile to the β-carbon and a proton to the α-carbon of MVK (`CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃`).\n    3.  **Michael Donor (Reactant C):** The rest of the molecule is the Michael donor. This is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system. The bond was formed at the C2 position of this ring. The C2 protons of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are very acidic because they are located between two carbonyl groups (an active methylene group). The base (`KOH`) removes one of these protons to form a highly stabilized enolate, which then acts as the nucleophile in the Michael addition.\n    4.  **Conclusion for C:** Therefore, reactant `C` is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
