    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe primary goal is to calculate the uncertainty, $\\Delta P_z$, of the operator $P_z$ for a system in a specific quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$. The formula for uncertainty is:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $P_z$.\n*   $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $P_z^2$.\n\n**2. Define the Operators and the State Vector**\n\nFrom the problem statement, we can write down the matrices for the operators and the column vector for the state. Let's set $\\hbar=1$ for now to simplify calculations and reintroduce it at the end.\n\nThe operator $P_z$ is:\n$P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe state of the system, $|\\psi\\rangle$, is given as a column vector:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe corresponding \"bra\" vector, $\\langle\\psi|$, is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*(Self-check: The problem states that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal, which is consistent with this statement. The eigenvectors are $(1,0,0)^T$, $(0,1,0)^T$, and $(0,0,1)^T$ with eigenvalues $\\hbar$, $0$, and $-\\hbar$ respectively.)*\n\n**3. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n\nThe expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nFirst, let's compute the action of the operator $P_z$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z|\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we compute the inner product with $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| (P_z|\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left[ (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right]$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left[ \\frac{1}{4} + 0 - \\frac{1}{4} \\right] = 0$\n\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z$ is 0.\n\n**4. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\n\nFirst, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$. Let's compute $P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, compute the inner product with $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| (P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left[ (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right]$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{4} + 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\right] = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\n\nNow we can plug the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. This corresponds to option B.\n\nTo verify the result, we can use a python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Set h_bar to 1 for calculation, will add it back in the final result.\nh_bar = 1\n\n# Define the operator P_z\nPz = h_bar * np.array([\n    [1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, -1]\n])\n\n# Define the state vector psi\npsi = np.array([\n    [-1/2],\n    [1/np.sqrt(2)],\n    [-1/2]\n])\n\n# Bra vector is the conjugate transpose of the ket\npsi_bra = psi.T.conj()\n\n# 1. Calculate the expectation value of P_z: <P_z> = <psi|P_z|psi>\n# First, Pz * psi\nPz_psi = Pz @ psi\n# Then, <psi| * (Pz * psi)\nexp_Pz = (psi_bra @ Pz_psi)[0, 0]\n\n# 2. Calculate the expectation value of P_z^2: <P_z^2> = <psi|P_z^2|psi>\n# First, find the matrix for P_z^2\nPz_squared = Pz @ Pz\n# Then calculate the expectation value\nPz_squared_psi = Pz_squared @ psi\nexp_Pz_squared = (psi_bra @ Pz_squared_psi)[0, 0]\n\n# 3. Calculate the uncertainty Delta P_z\n# Note: exp_Pz is 0, so the square is also 0.\nvariance = exp_Pz_squared - exp_Pz**2\nuncertainty = np.sqrt(variance)\n\n# The result is in units of h_bar.\n# The value of 1/sqrt(2) is approximately 0.707\n# The code output will be a float.\nprint(f\"The uncertainty Delta P_z is {uncertainty} * h_bar.\")\nprint(f\"For comparison, 1/sqrt(2) is approximately {1/np.sqrt(2)}.\")\nprint(f\"The expectation value <P_z^2> is {exp_Pz_squared} * h_bar^2.\")\nprint(f\"The expectation value <P_z> is {exp_Pz} * h_bar.\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$ in a given quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n**1. Recall the definition of uncertainty**\nThe uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the standard deviation:\n$\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\nwhere $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|A|\\psi\\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A$.\n\nFor this problem, we need to compute $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$.\n\n**2. Identify the operator matrix and the state vector**\nFrom the problem description, we have:\nThe matrix for the operator $P_z$:\n$P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe state of the system, represented as a column vector (ket):\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe corresponding bra vector is the conjugate transpose of the ket. Since the components are real, it is simply the transpose:\n$\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**3. Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| P_z |\\psi\\rangle$\n\nFirst, let's apply the operator $P_z$ to the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\times (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar \\times (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, compute the inner product with $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( (-\\frac{1}{2})(-\\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})(0) + (-\\frac{1}{2})(\\frac{1}{2}) \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = 0$\n\n**4. Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle$\n\nFirst, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$. Since $P_z$ is a diagonal matrix, $P_z^2$ is found by squaring the diagonal elements:\n$P_z^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-\\hbar)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we calculate $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( (-\\frac{1}{2})(-\\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})(0) + (-\\frac{1}{2})(-\\frac{1}{2}) \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{2}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n**5. Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\nNow we substitute the values of $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ and $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ into the uncertainty formula:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$.
