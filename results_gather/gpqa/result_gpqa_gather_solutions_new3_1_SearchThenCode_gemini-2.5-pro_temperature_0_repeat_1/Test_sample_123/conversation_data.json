The fraction of particles that survive after a certain time is determined by their proper lifetime and the time dilation effect due to their high velocity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Survival Probability:** The probability `P` that a particle survives for a time `t` in the laboratory frame is given by the exponential decay law. This law depends on the particle's mean proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) and the Lorentz factor `γ`. The formula is:\n    `P(t) = exp(-t / (γ * τ))`\n    The time `t` it takes for the particles to reach the detector wall is the radius of the detector `R` divided by the particle's velocity `v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t ≈ R / c`.\n    Substituting this into the survival equation, we get the fraction of particles `N/N₀` reaching the wall:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n2.  **Applying the Initial Conditions:** We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁` is 20, one-third of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   `N/N₀ = 1/3`\n    *   `R = 30 m`\n\n    Plugging these values into the equation:\n    `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * c * τ))`\n\n    To solve for the unknown `c * τ` term, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ)`\n    `-ln(3) = -1.5 / (c * τ)`\n    `ln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ)`\n\n3.  **Applying the Target Conditions:** We want to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which two-thirds of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   `N/N₀ = 2/3`\n    *   `γ₂ = ?`\n\n    Using the same survival equation:\n    `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * c * τ))`\n\n    Taking the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n    `ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n\n4.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):** We now have a system of two equations:\n    1) `ln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ)`\n    2) `ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n\n    We can establish a ratio between these two equations to eliminate the `c * τ` term. Dividing the second equation by the first:\n    `ln(1.5) / ln(3) = (30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)) / (1.5 / (c * τ))`\n    `ln(1.5) / ln(3) = (30 / γ₂) / 1.5`\n    `ln(1.5) / ln(3) = 20 / γ₂`\n\n    Now, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`\n\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    *   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n    *   `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis calculated value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo solve this problem, we will use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation as it applies to particle decay.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physics of Particle Decay\n\nThe number of particles, N, that survive after a time 't' from an initial population N₀ is described by the exponential decay law:\nN(t) = N₀ * e^(-t / T_lab)\n\nHere, T_lab is the average lifetime of the particles as measured in the laboratory frame. According to the theory of special relativity, a moving particle's lifetime appears longer to a stationary observer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, τ). This phenomenon is called time dilation and is given by the formula:\nT_lab = γ * τ\nwhere γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe time 't' it takes for the particles to reach the detector wall is the distance (the radius R) divided by their velocity (v). Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity is approximately the speed of light, c.\nt ≈ R / c\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, we get the fraction of particles that reach the detector:\nN/N₀ = e^(-(R/c) / (γτ)) = e^(-R / (γcτ))\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the First Scenario\n\nIn the first scenario, we are given:\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₁): 20\n*   Fraction of surviving particles (N₁/N₀): 1/3\n*   Detector radius (R): 30 m\n\nPlugging these values into our equation:\n1/3 = e^(-30 / (20 * cτ))\n\nTo solve for the unknown constant part of the exponent, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)\n-ln(3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)\nln(3) = 30 / (20 * cτ)\n\nThis equation relates the physical properties of the particle (its proper lifetime τ) and the detector setup.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Second Scenario\n\nIn the second scenario, we want to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂) that results in a different survival fraction:\n*   Target fraction of surviving particles (N₂/N₀): 2/3\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₂): ?\n*   Detector radius (R): 30 m\n\nThe equation for this scenario is:\n2/3 = e^(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\nln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n\n### Step 4: Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂)\n\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n1.  ln(3) = 30 / (20 * cτ)\n2.  ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n\nWe can solve this system by creating a ratio of the two equations to eliminate the common term `30 / (cτ)`:\n(ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = [30 / (20 * cτ)] / [30 / (γ₂ * cτ)]\n(ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = (1/20) / (1/γ₂)\n(ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = γ₂ / 20\n\nNow, we can solve for γ₂:\nγ₂ = 20 * [ln(3) / ln(3/2)]\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055):\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709\nγ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem deals with the exponential decay of relativistic particles. The fraction of particles that survive after traveling a certain distance depends on their lifetime, which is affected by time dilation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **The Survival Equation:**\n    The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial sample `N₀` after a time `t` in the lab frame is given by the decay law:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T_lab)`\n    where `T_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:**\n    Due to special relativity, the lifetime of a moving particle is dilated. The lab-frame lifetime `T_lab` is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `T_lab = γ * τ`\n\n3.  **Travel Time:**\n    The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time `t` it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` is:\n    `t ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combined Formula:**\n    Substituting the expressions for `T_lab` and `t` into the decay law, we get the fraction of particles `N/N₀` that reach the detector wall:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ)) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n    The term `cτ` is a constant property of the particle, representing its proper decay length.\n\n5.  **Using the Initial Condition:**\n    We are given that for a Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one-third of the particles reach the detector (`N₁/N₀ = 1/3`). The radius `R` is 30 m.\n    `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * cτ))`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)`\n    `-ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)`\n    `ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)`  (Equation 1)\n\n6.  **Setting up the Second Condition:**\n    We want to find the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` for which two-thirds of the particles reach the detector (`N₂/N₀ = 2/3`).\n    `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n    `ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`  (Equation 2)\n\n7.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n    We can solve for `γ₂` by dividing Equation 1 by Equation 2. This cancels out the unknown `cτ` term.\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = (1.5 / cτ) / (30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = (1.5 / cτ) * (γ₂ * cτ / 30)`\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = 1.5 * γ₂ / 30`\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = γ₂ / 20`\n\n    Now, we can isolate `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n8.  **Calculation:**\n    Using the values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the required Lorentz factor.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Particle Decay:**\n    The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by an exponential decay law. The number of particles, N, remaining at a time 't' from an initial population N₀ is given by:\n    N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t/τ)\n    Here, 't' is the time measured in the particle's own rest frame (this is called the proper time), and 'τ' is the mean proper lifetime of the particle, a constant for a given particle type.\n\n2.  **Relate Lab Frame and Particle's Rest Frame (Time Dilation):**\n    The problem is described from the perspective of the laboratory (the detector). The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the wall of the detector in the lab frame is `t_lab`.\n    However, due to time dilation from special relativity, the time experienced by the fast-moving particle (its proper time, `t_proper`) is shorter. The relationship is:\n    `t_lab = γ * t_proper`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle is `t_proper = t_lab / γ`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time of Flight in the Lab Frame:**\n    The particles travel a distance equal to the detector's radius, R = 30 m. They are ultra-relativistic, meaning their speed `v` is extremely close to the speed of light, `c`. We can approximate `v ≈ c`.\n    So, the time of flight in the lab frame is:\n    `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combine the Concepts for the First Scenario:**\n    *   Initial Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n    *   Fraction of particles reaching the wall is 1/3. This means N/N₀ = 1/3.\n    *   The proper time for this scenario is `t_proper₁ = t_lab / γ₁ ≈ (R/c) / γ₁`.\n    *   Plugging this into the decay equation:\n        `1/3 = e^(-t_proper₁ / τ) = e^(-(R / (c * γ₁ * τ)))`\n\n5.  **Analyze the First Scenario Equation:**\n    To solve this, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = - (R / (c * γ₁ * τ))`\n    Using the property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `-ln(3) = - (R / (c * γ₁ * τ))`\n    `ln(3) = R / (c * γ₁ * τ)`\n    This equation relates the known `γ₁` to the unknown constants `R`, `c`, and `τ`. We can rearrange it to find an expression for the constant group `R / (c * τ)`:\n    `R / (c * τ) = γ₁ * ln(3)`\n\n6.  **Formulate the Equation for the Second Scenario:**\n    *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    *   The fraction of particles reaching the wall is 2/3. So, N/N₀ = 2/3.\n    *   The proper time for this scenario is `t_proper₂ = t_lab / γ₂ ≈ (R/c) / γ₂`.\n    *   Plugging this into the decay equation:\n        `2/3 = e^(-t_proper₂ / τ) = e^(-(R / (c * γ₂ * τ)))`\n\n7.  **Analyze the Second Scenario Equation and Solve for γ₂:**\n    Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = - (R / (c * γ₂ * τ))`\n    Using the property `ln(x/y) = -ln(y/x)`:\n    `-ln(3/2) = - (R / (c * γ₂ * τ))`\n    `ln(3/2) = R / (c * γ₂ * τ)`\n    Rearranging for the constant group `R / (c * τ)`:\n    `R / (c * τ) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n8.  **Equate the Expressions and Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    We now have two different expressions for the same constant group `R / (c * τ)`. We can set them equal to each other:\n    `γ₁ * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n    We can now solve for the unknown `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = γ₁ * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n    Now, substitute the known value `γ₁ = 20`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(1.5))`\n    Using the approximate values for the logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Proper Time:** The most critical point is to use the proper time (`t_proper`) in the exponential decay formula, not the lab time (`t_lab`).\n*   **Time Dilation:** Correctly applying the time dilation formula `t_proper = t_lab / γ` is essential. A higher Lorentz factor `γ` means the particle experiences less time, and therefore less decay.\n*   **Constant Grouping:** Realizing that `R`, `c`, and `τ` are all constants allows you to solve the problem without needing their specific values. The ratio of the two scenarios cancels them out.\n*   **Logical Check:** To have more particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must decay less. For a fixed travel distance, this means they must experience less proper time. This requires a *higher* Lorentz factor. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is higher than `γ₁ = 20`, which makes physical sense.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.18, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem describes the decay of relativistic particles. The fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that survive after traveling a distance `R` is given by the exponential decay law:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n\nwhere `t_lab` is the time of flight in the lab frame and `τ_lab` is the particle's lifetime in the lab frame.\n\n1.  **Time of Flight (`t_lab`):** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The detector has a radius `R`. The time to reach the wall is:\n    `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n2.  **Lifetime in Lab Frame (`τ_lab`):** Due to time dilation, the lifetime of a particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` is longer in the lab frame than its proper lifetime `τ_proper` (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`\n\n3.  **Combined Equation:** Substituting these into the decay equation gives the fraction of particles reaching the detector:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n    We can group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ_proper` into a single constant `K = R / (c * τ_proper)`, as these values do not change between the two scenarios.\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n4.  **Using the First Condition:** We are given that for a Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one-third (`1/3`) of the particles reach the detector.\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n5.  **Solving for the Second Condition:** We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which two-thirds (`2/3`) of the particles reach the detector.\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    Again, take the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    Now, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`\n    Substitute the value of `K` we found in the previous step:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we can simplify this to:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n    `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n    `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055 ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19, which is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe relationship between the fraction of surviving particles (`f`), the Lorentz factor (`γ`), the detector radius (`R`), and the particle's proper lifetime (`τ`) is described by the exponential decay law in the laboratory frame.\n\nThe time it takes for a particle to travel to the detector wall in the lab frame is `t_lab = R/v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R/c`.\n\nThe lifetime of the particles in the lab frame is dilated by the Lorentz factor: `t_dilated = γ * τ`.\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive is given by `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / t_dilated)`.\nSubstituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `t_dilated`, we get:\n`f = exp(- (R/c) / (γ * τ) ) = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ))`\n\nLet's define a constant `K = R / (c * τ)`, which depends on the detector setup and the particle's intrinsic properties, but not on the Lorentz factor. The equation becomes:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for `K`:\n`ln(f) = -K / γ`\n`K = -γ * ln(f) = γ * ln(1/f)`\n\nSince `K` is the same for both scenarios, we can write:\n`γ₁ * ln(1/f₁) = γ₂ * ln(1/f₂)`\n\nNow, we plug in the values from the problem:\n*   Scenario 1: `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n*   Scenario 2: `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n`20 * ln(1 / (1/3)) = γ₂ * ln(1 / (2/3))`\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, we solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\nUsing the values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay. The search results confirm the relevant physics concepts.\n\n*   **Exponential Decay Law**: The number of particles, N, remaining from an initial sample, N₀, after a time, t, follows the exponential decay law N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/τ), where τ is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n*   **Time Dilation**: For a particle moving at a relativistic speed, its internal clock runs slower as observed from the lab frame. The lifetime as measured in the lab, t_lab, is related to the proper lifetime, τ, by the Lorentz factor, γ (gamma). The lab-frame lifetime is t_lab = γτ.\n*   **Relativistic Decay in Lab Frame**: Combining these, the number of particles remaining after a time t_lab in the lab frame is N(t_lab) = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / (γτ)).\n*   **Distance and Time**: For ultra-relativistic particles, their velocity, v, is approximately the speed of light, c. The time taken to travel a distance, d, in the lab is t_lab ≈ d/c.\n\nThis allows us to write the fraction of surviving particles as a function of distance d:\nN(d)/N₀ = exp(-d / (γ * c * τ))\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n**1.

The search results confirm the fundamental concepts I used.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a moving particle (`t`) as observed in a stationary frame (like the detector) is longer than its proper lifetime (`τ`, its lifetime in its own rest frame). The relationship is `t = γ * τ`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Particle Decay Law:** The probability that a particle survives for a time `t` in the lab frame is given by an exponential decay law: `P(t) = exp(-t / (γ * τ))`. This is equivalent to the fraction of particles remaining, `N/N₀`.\n*   **Travel Time:** For ultra-relativistic particles, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time taken to travel a distance `R` is `t ≈ R / c`.\n\nCombining these, the fraction of particles reaching the detector wall at radius `R` is:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ))`\n\nThis confirms that the formula used in the initial reasoning was correct.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation again to ensure accuracy:\n\n1.  **Set up the equation:**\n    The fraction of surviving particles, `N/N₀`, is given by `exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`.

The fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that survive after a time `t` in their own rest frame is given by:\n    `N/N₀ = e^(-t/τ)`\n    where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle (a constant for a given particle type).\n\n2.  **Incorporate Special Relativity (Time Dilation):**\n    The particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds relative to the detector (the lab frame). Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime appears longer in the lab frame. The dilated lifetime, `τ'`, is given by:\n    `τ' = γτ`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    The decay law in the lab frame, for a time `t_lab`, becomes:\n    `N/N₀ = e^(-t_lab / τ') = e^(-t_lab / (γτ))`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time of Flight in the Lab Frame:**\n    The particles are created at the center and travel to the inner wall of the spherical detector.\n    *   Radius of the detector, `R = 30 m`.\n    *   The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`.\n    *   The time it takes to reach the wall in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the First Scenario:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n    *   Fraction of particles reaching the wall (surviving) = `1/3`.\n    *   Using the decay formula from Step 2:\n        `1/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (γ₁τ))`\n    *   Substitute `γ₁ = 20`:\n        `1/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (20τ))`\n    *   To solve for the unknown term `(R/c)/τ`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -(R/c) / (20τ)`\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n        `-ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20τ)`\n    *   This gives us a value for the constant term that depends on the particle and detector properties:\n        `(R/c) / τ = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n5.  **Analyze the Second Scenario:**\n    *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    *   The desired fraction of particles reaching the wall is `2/3`.\n    *   Set up the decay equation for this scenario:\n        `2/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (γ₂τ))`\n    *   Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = -(R/c) / (γ₂τ)`\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`:\n        `-ln(3/2) = -(R/c) / (γ₂τ)`\n    *   This gives us another expression:\n        `(R/c) / τ = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n    We now have two expressions for the same constant `(R/c) / τ`. We can set them equal to each other:\n    `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    Now, isolate `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2)))`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Use the standard values for natural logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(2) ≈ 0.6931`.\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / (1.0986 - 0.6931))`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.

Solving for this term in the first scenario is the key to solving the second.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe fraction of particles, `f`, that survive to travel a distance `R` is given by the exponential decay law, where the time is considered in the particle's own reference frame (proper time, `t_p`).\n\n`f = N/N₀ = exp(-t_p / τ)`\n\nwhere `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n\nThe time it takes for the particle to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n\nDue to time dilation, the proper time `t_p` experienced by the particle is related to the lab time `t_lab` by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n\n`t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ`\n\nSubstituting this into the decay equation:\n\n`f = exp(-(R / (c * γ)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\nLet's define a constant `K = R / (c * τ)`. This value is constant for this experiment since the detector radius `R` and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` do not change.

This relationship is defined by the Lorentz factor (γ):\n    τ_lab = γ * τ₀\n    This phenomenon is a key prediction of special relativity and has been experimentally verified numerous times.\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are produced at the center of the detector and travel to the inner wall. The time it takes for them to travel the radius (R) of the detector is:\n    t = R / v\n    Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed (v) is approximately the speed of light (c).

Define the survival fraction of particles using the exponential decay law, incorporating time dilation. The number of particles N at a time t in the lab frame is given by N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / (γ * τ)), where N₀ is the initial number, τ is the proper lifetime, and γ is the Lorentz factor.\n2.  The time `t` for a particle to travel the detector radius `R` is `t = R/v`.

    "This problem requires us to determine the new Lorentz factor needed to change the survival rate of decaying particles. The solution involves applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, to the law of exponential decay.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    The fraction of particles, `f = N/N₀`, that survive after a certain time is governed by the exponential decay law. In the particle's own rest frame (proper frame), this is `f = exp(-t_proper / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n\n2.  **Incorporate Relativistic Effects:**\n    From the laboratory's perspective, two key relativistic effects are at play:\n    *   **Time of Flight (`t_lab`):** The particles travel the detector radius `R = 30 m`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the time taken in the lab frame is `t_lab ≈ R/c`.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** The time experienced by the moving particle (`t_proper`) is shorter than the time measured in the lab (`t_lab`) by a factor of `γ` (the Lorentz factor). The relationship is `t_proper = t_lab / γ`.\n\n3.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    We substitute the relativistic expressions into the decay law to get the survival fraction in terms of lab-frame variables:\n    `f = exp(-(t_lab / γ) / τ) = exp(-t_lab / (γ * τ))`\n    Now, substituting `t_lab ≈ R/c`:\n    `f = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Two Scenarios:**\n    The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius and the particle's proper lifetime do not change.

The fraction of particles that survive after a certain time is determined by their proper lifetime and the time dilation effect due to their high velocity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Survival Probability:** The probability `P` that a particle survives for a time `t` in the laboratory frame is given by the exponential decay law. This law depends on the particle's mean proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) and the Lorentz factor `γ`. The formula is:\n    `P(t) = exp(-t / (γ * τ))`\n    The time `t` it takes for the particles to reach the detector wall is the radius of the detector `R` divided by the particle's velocity `v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t ≈ R / c`.\n    Substituting this into the survival equation, we get the fraction of particles `N/N₀` reaching the wall:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n2.  **Applying the Initial Conditions:** We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁` is 20, one-third of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   `N/N₀ = 1/3`\n    *   `R = 30 m`\n\n    Plugging these values into the equation:\n    `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * c * τ))`\n\n    To solve for the unknown `c * τ` term, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ)`\n    `-ln(3) = -1.5 / (c * τ)`\n    `ln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ)`\n\n3.  **Applying the Target Conditions:** We want to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which two-thirds of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   `N/N₀ = 2/3`\n    *   `γ₂ = ?`\n\n    Using the same survival equation:\n    `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * c * τ))`\n\n    Taking the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n    `ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n\n4.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):** We now have a system of two equations:\n    1) `ln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ)`\n    2) `ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n\n    We can establish a ratio between these two equations to eliminate the `c * τ` term. Dividing the second equation by the first:\n    `ln(1.5) / ln(3) = (30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)) / (1.5 / (c * τ))`\n    `ln(1.5) / ln(3) = (30 / γ₂) / 1.5`\n    `ln(1.5) / ln(3) = 20 / γ₂`\n\n    Now, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`\n\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    *   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n    *   `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis calculated value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo solve this problem, we will use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation as it applies to particle decay.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physics of Particle Decay\n\nThe number of particles, N, that survive after a time 't' from an initial population N₀ is described by the exponential decay law:\nN(t) = N₀ * e^(-t / T_lab)\n\nHere, T_lab is the average lifetime of the particles as measured in the laboratory frame. According to the theory of special relativity, a moving particle's lifetime appears longer to a stationary observer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, τ). This phenomenon is called time dilation and is given by the formula:\nT_lab = γ * τ\nwhere γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe time 't' it takes for the particles to reach the detector wall is the distance (the radius R) divided by their velocity (v). Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity is approximately the speed of light, c.\nt ≈ R / c\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, we get the fraction of particles that reach the detector:\nN/N₀ = e^(-(R/c) / (γτ)) = e^(-R / (γcτ))\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the First Scenario\n\nIn the first scenario, we are given:\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₁): 20\n*   Fraction of surviving particles (N₁/N₀): 1/3\n*   Detector radius (R): 30 m\n\nPlugging these values into our equation:\n1/3 = e^(-30 / (20 * cτ))\n\nTo solve for the unknown constant part of the exponent, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)\n-ln(3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)\nln(3) = 30 / (20 * cτ)\n\nThis equation relates the physical properties of the particle (its proper lifetime τ) and the detector setup.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Second Scenario\n\nIn the second scenario, we want to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂) that results in a different survival fraction:\n*   Target fraction of surviving particles (N₂/N₀): 2/3\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₂): ?\n*   Detector radius (R): 30 m\n\nThe equation for this scenario is:\n2/3 = e^(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\nln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n\n### Step 4: Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂)\n\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n1.  ln(3) = 30 / (20 * cτ)\n2.  ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n\nWe can solve this system by creating a ratio of the two equations to eliminate the common term `30 / (cτ)`:\n(ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = [30 / (20 * cτ)] / [30 / (γ₂ * cτ)]\n(ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = (1/20) / (1/γ₂)\n(ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = γ₂ / 20\n\nNow, we can solve for γ₂:\nγ₂ = 20 * [ln(3) / ln(3/2)]\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055):\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709\nγ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem deals with the exponential decay of relativistic particles. The fraction of particles that survive after traveling a certain distance depends on their lifetime, which is affected by time dilation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **The Survival Equation:**\n    The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial sample `N₀` after a time `t` in the lab frame is given by the decay law:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T_lab)`\n    where `T_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:**\n    Due to special relativity, the lifetime of a moving particle is dilated. The lab-frame lifetime `T_lab` is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `T_lab = γ * τ`\n\n3.  **Travel Time:**\n    The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time `t` it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` is:\n    `t ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combined Formula:**\n    Substituting the expressions for `T_lab` and `t` into the decay law, we get the fraction of particles `N/N₀` that reach the detector wall:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ)) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n    The term `cτ` is a constant property of the particle, representing its proper decay length.\n\n5.  **Using the Initial Condition:**\n    We are given that for a Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one-third of the particles reach the detector (`N₁/N₀ = 1/3`). The radius `R` is 30 m.\n    `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * cτ))`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)`\n    `-ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)`\n    `ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)`  (Equation 1)\n\n6.  **Setting up the Second Condition:**\n    We want to find the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` for which two-thirds of the particles reach the detector (`N₂/N₀ = 2/3`).\n    `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n    `ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`  (Equation 2)\n\n7.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n    We can solve for `γ₂` by dividing Equation 1 by Equation 2. This cancels out the unknown `cτ` term.\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = (1.5 / cτ) / (30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = (1.5 / cτ) * (γ₂ * cτ / 30)`\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = 1.5 * γ₂ / 30`\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = γ₂ / 20`\n\n    Now, we can isolate `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n8.  **Calculation:**\n    Using the values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the required Lorentz factor.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Particle Decay:**\n    The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by an exponential decay law. The number of particles, N, remaining at a time 't' from an initial population N₀ is given by:\n    N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t/τ)\n    Here, 't' is the time measured in the particle's own rest frame (this is called the proper time), and 'τ' is the mean proper lifetime of the particle, a constant for a given particle type.\n\n2.  **Relate Lab Frame and Particle's Rest Frame (Time Dilation):**\n    The problem is described from the perspective of the laboratory (the detector). The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the wall of the detector in the lab frame is `t_lab`.\n    However, due to time dilation from special relativity, the time experienced by the fast-moving particle (its proper time, `t_proper`) is shorter. The relationship is:\n    `t_lab = γ * t_proper`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle is `t_proper = t_lab / γ`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time of Flight in the Lab Frame:**\n    The particles travel a distance equal to the detector's radius, R = 30 m. They are ultra-relativistic, meaning their speed `v` is extremely close to the speed of light, `c`. We can approximate `v ≈ c`.\n    So, the time of flight in the lab frame is:\n    `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combine the Concepts for the First Scenario:**\n    *   Initial Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n    *   Fraction of particles reaching the wall is 1/3. This means N/N₀ = 1/3.\n    *   The proper time for this scenario is `t_proper₁ = t_lab / γ₁ ≈ (R/c) / γ₁`.\n    *   Plugging this into the decay equation:\n        `1/3 = e^(-t_proper₁ / τ) = e^(-(R / (c * γ₁ * τ)))`\n\n5.  **Analyze the First Scenario Equation:**\n    To solve this, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = - (R / (c * γ₁ * τ))`\n    Using the property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `-ln(3) = - (R / (c * γ₁ * τ))`\n    `ln(3) = R / (c * γ₁ * τ)`\n    This equation relates the known `γ₁` to the unknown constants `R`, `c`, and `τ`. We can rearrange it to find an expression for the constant group `R / (c * τ)`:\n    `R / (c * τ) = γ₁ * ln(3)`\n\n6.  **Formulate the Equation for the Second Scenario:**\n    *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    *   The fraction of particles reaching the wall is 2/3. So, N/N₀ = 2/3.\n    *   The proper time for this scenario is `t_proper₂ = t_lab / γ₂ ≈ (R/c) / γ₂`.\n    *   Plugging this into the decay equation:\n        `2/3 = e^(-t_proper₂ / τ) = e^(-(R / (c * γ₂ * τ)))`\n\n7.  **Analyze the Second Scenario Equation and Solve for γ₂:**\n    Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = - (R / (c * γ₂ * τ))`\n    Using the property `ln(x/y) = -ln(y/x)`:\n    `-ln(3/2) = - (R / (c * γ₂ * τ))`\n    `ln(3/2) = R / (c * γ₂ * τ)`\n    Rearranging for the constant group `R / (c * τ)`:\n    `R / (c * τ) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n8.  **Equate the Expressions and Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    We now have two different expressions for the same constant group `R / (c * τ)`. We can set them equal to each other:\n    `γ₁ * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n    We can now solve for the unknown `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = γ₁ * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n    Now, substitute the known value `γ₁ = 20`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(1.5))`\n    Using the approximate values for the logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Proper Time:** The most critical point is to use the proper time (`t_proper`) in the exponential decay formula, not the lab time (`t_lab`).\n*   **Time Dilation:** Correctly applying the time dilation formula `t_proper = t_lab / γ` is essential. A higher Lorentz factor `γ` means the particle experiences less time, and therefore less decay.\n*   **Constant Grouping:** Realizing that `R`, `c`, and `τ` are all constants allows you to solve the problem without needing their specific values. The ratio of the two scenarios cancels them out.\n*   **Logical Check:** To have more particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must decay less. For a fixed travel distance, this means they must experience less proper time. This requires a *higher* Lorentz factor. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is higher than `γ₁ = 20`, which makes physical sense.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.18, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem describes the decay of relativistic particles. The fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that survive after traveling a distance `R` is given by the exponential decay law:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n\nwhere `t_lab` is the time of flight in the lab frame and `τ_lab` is the particle's lifetime in the lab frame.\n\n1.  **Time of Flight (`t_lab`):** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The detector has a radius `R`. The time to reach the wall is:\n    `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n2.  **Lifetime in Lab Frame (`τ_lab`):** Due to time dilation, the lifetime of a particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` is longer in the lab frame than its proper lifetime `τ_proper` (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`\n\n3.  **Combined Equation:** Substituting these into the decay equation gives the fraction of particles reaching the detector:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n    We can group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ_proper` into a single constant `K = R / (c * τ_proper)`, as these values do not change between the two scenarios.\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n4.  **Using the First Condition:** We are given that for a Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one-third (`1/3`) of the particles reach the detector.\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n5.  **Solving for the Second Condition:** We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which two-thirds (`2/3`) of the particles reach the detector.\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    Again, take the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    Now, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`\n    Substitute the value of `K` we found in the previous step:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we can simplify this to:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n    `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n    `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055 ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19, which is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe relationship between the fraction of surviving particles (`f`), the Lorentz factor (`γ`), the detector radius (`R`), and the particle's proper lifetime (`τ`) is described by the exponential decay law in the laboratory frame.\n\nThe time it takes for a particle to travel to the detector wall in the lab frame is `t_lab = R/v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R/c`.\n\nThe lifetime of the particles in the lab frame is dilated by the Lorentz factor: `t_dilated = γ * τ`.\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive is given by `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / t_dilated)`.\nSubstituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `t_dilated`, we get:\n`f = exp(- (R/c) / (γ * τ) ) = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ))`\n\nLet's define a constant `K = R / (c * τ)`, which depends on the detector setup and the particle's intrinsic properties, but not on the Lorentz factor. The equation becomes:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for `K`:\n`ln(f) = -K / γ`\n`K = -γ * ln(f) = γ * ln(1/f)`\n\nSince `K` is the same for both scenarios, we can write:\n`γ₁ * ln(1/f₁) = γ₂ * ln(1/f₂)`\n\nNow, we plug in the values from the problem:\n*   Scenario 1: `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n*   Scenario 2: `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n`20 * ln(1 / (1/3)) = γ₂ * ln(1 / (2/3))`\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, we solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\nUsing the values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.

Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime appears longer in the lab frame. The dilated lifetime, `τ'`, is given by:\n    `τ' = γτ`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    The decay law in the lab frame, for a time `t_lab`, becomes:\n    `N/N₀ = e^(-t_lab / τ') = e^(-t_lab / (γτ))`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time of Flight in the Lab Frame:**\n    The particles are created at the center and travel to the inner wall of the spherical detector.\n    *   Radius of the detector, `R = 30 m`.\n    *   The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`.\n    *   The time it takes to reach the wall in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the First Scenario:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n    *   Fraction of particles reaching the wall (surviving) = `1/3`.\n    *   Using the decay formula from Step 2:\n        `1/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (γ₁τ))`\n    *   Substitute `γ₁ = 20`:\n        `1/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (20τ))`\n    *   To solve for the unknown term `(R/c)/τ`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -(R/c) / (20τ)`\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n        `-ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20τ)`\n    *   This gives us a value for the constant term that depends on the particle and detector properties:\n        `(R/c) / τ = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n5.  **Analyze the Second Scenario:**\n    *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    *   The desired fraction of particles reaching the wall is `2/3`.\n    *   Set up the decay equation for this scenario:\n        `2/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (γ₂τ))`\n    *   Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = -(R/c) / (γ₂τ)`\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`:\n        `-ln(3/2) = -(R/c) / (γ₂τ)`\n    *   This gives us another expression:\n        `(R/c) / τ = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n    We now have two expressions for the same constant `(R/c) / τ`. We can set them equal to each other:\n    `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    Now, isolate `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2)))`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Use the standard values for natural logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(2) ≈ 0.6931`.\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / (1.0986 - 0.6931))`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.

The relationship is exponential, which requires the use of natural logarithms to solve.\n*   **Constant Term:** The term `(R/c)/τ` combines all the fixed parameters of the system (detector size and particle's proper lifetime). Solving for this term in the first scenario is the key to solving the second.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe fraction of particles, `f`, that survive to travel a distance `R` is given by the exponential decay law, where the time is considered in the particle's own reference frame (proper time, `t_p`).\n\n`f = N/N₀ = exp(-t_p / τ)`\n\nwhere `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n\nThe time it takes for the particle to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n\nDue to time dilation, the proper time `t_p` experienced by the particle is related to the lab time `t_lab` by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n\n`t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ`\n\nSubstituting this into the decay equation:\n\n`f = exp(-(R / (c * γ)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\nLet's define a constant `K = R / (c * τ)`. This value is constant for this experiment since the detector radius `R` and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` do not change.

This relationship is defined by the Lorentz factor (γ):\n    τ_lab = γ * τ₀\n    This phenomenon is a key prediction of special relativity and has been experimentally verified numerous times.\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are produced at the center of the detector and travel to the inner wall. The time it takes for them to travel the radius (R) of the detector is:\n    t = R / v\n    Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed (v) is approximately the speed of light (c).

This can be solved by using the relativistic particle decay formula.\n\nMy proposed solution is as follows:\n1.  Define the survival fraction of particles using the exponential decay law, incorporating time dilation. The number of particles N at a time t in the lab frame is given by N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / (γ * τ)), where N₀ is the initial number, τ is the proper lifetime, and γ is the Lorentz factor.\n2.  The time `t` for a particle to travel the detector radius `R` is `t = R/v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, we can approximate their velocity `v` as the speed of light `c`, so `t ≈ R/c`.\n3.  Set up two equations based on the two scenarios given:\n    *   Scenario 1: γ₁ = 20, and the survival fraction N/N₀ = 1/3. This gives: 1/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (20 * τ)).\n    *   Scenario 2: γ₂ is unknown, and the survival fraction N/N₀ = 2/3. This gives: 2/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ)).\n4.  Solve these two equations to find γ₂. By taking the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation and then taking their ratio, the unknown terms `R/c` and `τ` will cancel out, allowing for a direct calculation of γ₂.\n\nMy proposed action is to perform a search to get the precise values of the natural logarithms needed for the calculation.\n\nSkeptic: The proposed path is logical. The use of the relativistic decay formula is appropriate, and the method of solving the two simultaneous equations by taking their ratio is efficient as it eliminates the unknown proper lifetime (τ) and the `R/c` term.

The minor difference can be attributed to the initial condition stating the Lorentz factor is \"~20\".\n\nThe debate converges. The method is sound, the necessary data has been acquired, and the calculation is verified.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
