This requires careful consideration of the directing effects of each group.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Substituent Effects**:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3)**: This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br)**: This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2)**: This is a strong deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\n2.  **Evaluation of Synthetic Routes**: The goal is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene. This substitution pattern is achieved when *meta*-directing groups are used to guide subsequent additions.\n\n    *   **Starting with Bromination or Nitration**: If the first step were bromination (as in option C), the bromo group would direct the next substituent to the *ortho* and *para* positions, which is incorrect for the desired 1,3,5-pattern. If the first step were nitration (as in options A and B), the nitro group would correctly direct the next substituent to the *meta* position. However, a major limitation of the Friedel-Crafts acylation is that it fails on strongly deactivated rings like nitrobenzene. Therefore, adding the acetyl group after nitration is not feasible.\n\n    *   **Starting with Friedel-Crafts Acylation (Option D)**: This is the most logical first step.\n        *   **Step i) CH3COCl/AlCl3**: Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n        *   **Step ii) Br2/FeBr3**: The acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position. This reaction yields 3-bromoacetophenone, correctly establishing the 1,3-relationship.\n        *   **Step iii) HNO3/H2SO4**: The final step is the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. Now, the ring has two directing groups: the *meta*-directing acetyl group and the *ortho, para*-directing bromo group. The acetyl group directs the new nitro group to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. The only position where their directing effects align is position 5 (*meta* to the acetyl group and *ortho* to the bromo group). This synergistic effect leads to the high-yield synthesis of the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe subsequent steps listed in option D (iv through vii) are unnecessary for creating the final product and appear to be erroneous. However, the initial three steps of option D represent the only chemically sound and high-yield pathway to the desired compound among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful sequence of reactions is required to ensure the substituents are placed at the correct positions (1, 3, and 5). This involves considering the directing effects of each group added to the benzene ring. The target molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) all in a meta relationship to each other.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the most effective synthesis strategy, which aligns with the steps presented in one of the options:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** The first step is to add the acetyl group to the benzene ring. This is achieved by reacting benzene with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst like aluminum chloride (AlCl3). This reaction forms acetophenone. The acetyl group is a meta-director and deactivates the ring for subsequent electrophilic substitutions.\n\n2.  **Bromination:** The second step is the bromination of acetophenone. Since the acetyl group is a meta-director, it will direct the incoming bromine atom to the meta (position 3) position. This reaction is carried out using bromine (Br2) and a Lewis acid catalyst such as iron(III) bromide (FeBr3), yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n\n3.  **Nitration:** The final step is to introduce the nitro group. At this stage, the benzene ring has two substituents: an acetyl group at position 1 (meta-director) and a bromine atom at position 3 (ortho-, para-director).\n    *   The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n    *   The bromo group directs incoming groups to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   When directing effects are in conflict, the position that is least sterically hindered and electronically favored will be the major product. In this case, both existing groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. The acetyl group strongly directs meta to itself, and the bromo group directs ortho/para. Position 5 is ortho to the bromine and meta to the acetyl group. More importantly, in a 1,3-disubstituted ring, substitution at the 5-position is strongly favored as both groups direct the incoming electrophile to this position. This reaction, using a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), yields the final product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis three-step sequence is the most direct and high-yield pathway. However, the options provided are more complex, suggesting a misunderstanding in the premise of the question options. Based on the most chemically sound principles for achieving the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern, a sequence starting with acylation, followed by the introduction of the other two groups, is the correct approach. The other options fail because they either perform Friedel-Crafts acylation on a heavily deactivated ring (which is not feasible), or they follow a sequence of directing effects that would not lead to the 1,3,5-product.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the provided options based on this correct three-step synthesis: `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4`. This sequence is a truncated version of option D. The additional steps in option D (reduction, nitration, diazotization, deamination) are nonsensical and incorrect in that order. However, since the initial three steps of option D are the only chemically logical start to forming a 1,3,5-substituted acetophenone derivative, it is the most plausible choice despite its flawed later steps.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each option to determine the correct sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule:**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are meta to each other. Let's analyze their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   -COCH3: meta-director, deactivating.\n*   -Br: ortho,para-director, deactivating.\n*   -NO2: meta-director, strongly deactivating.\n\nThe presence of an ortho,para-director (-Br) meta to two meta-directors makes direct substitution challenging. This often requires a more complex strategy, possibly involving the use of a temporary directing group that is later removed or modified (e.g., via a Sandmeyer reaction). The presence of reagents like Fe/HCl, NaNO2/HCl, and H3PO2 in the options strongly suggests such a strategy is employed.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline (reduction)\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride (diazotization)\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene (deamination with H3PO2)\nThis sequence of steps i-iv starts with benzene and ends with benzene, making it a pointless loop. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene\n*   ii) Bromobenzene → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product) and o-bromonitrobenzene.\n*   iii) p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails or gives very low yields on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a nitro group. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene → Acetophenone\n*   ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone (The acetyl group is a meta-director).\n*   iii) Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. The substituents are -COCH3 (meta-director) at C1 and -Br (ortho,para-director) at C3. The directing effects are conflicting. The -Br group directs nitration to positions 2, 4, and 6, while the -COCH3 group directs to position 5. The o,p-directing effect of the halogen will dominate, leading to a mixture of 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one and 1-(3-bromo-6-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one would not be the major product. This is not a high-yield synthesis. Thus, option D is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nThis sequence is complex but represents a valid, albeit sophisticated, synthetic strategy. Let's break it down. The final steps (vi, vii) are diazotization and deamination, which remove an amino group. This is a powerful technique to achieve substitution patterns that are otherwise inaccessible. The synthesis likely involves creating a precursor with an extra amino group, which is then removed.\n\nHere is the plausible reaction pathway for option C:\n1.  **i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene**\n2.  **ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline**\n3.  **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl → Acetanilide.** This is an N-acylation to protect the amino group. The acetyl group makes the amine less activating and sterically hinders it. (Note: AlCl3 is typically used for Friedel-Crafts C-acylation, not N-acylation, and would problematically complex with the amine. Its inclusion here is likely to indicate it will be used for a later Fries rearrangement step).\n4.  **iv) Acetanilide + Br2/FeBr3 → 4-Bromoacetanilide.** The -NHCOCH3 group is an ortho,para-director, and the para product is major due to less steric hindrance.\n5.  **v) 4-Bromoacetanilide + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-Bromo-2-nitroacetanilide.** The activating -NHCOCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to its ortho position (C2), which is also meta to the bromo group.\n6.  **Fries Rearrangement:** The product from step v, 4-bromo-2-nitroacetanilide, is treated with the Lewis acid **AlCl3** (from step iii). This causes the acetyl group to migrate from the nitrogen atom to the ring, typically ortho to the amino group. This yields **1-(2-amino-5-bromo-3-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n7.  **vi) Diazotization:** The resulting primary amine, 1-(2-amino-5-bromo-3-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, is treated with **NaNO2/HCl** to form a diazonium salt.\n8.  **vii) Deamination:** The diazonium salt is treated with **H3PO2** to remove the diazonium group and replace it with a hydrogen atom. This removes the temporary amino group from position 2.\n\nThe final product is **1-(5-bromo-3-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, which is the same molecule as the target, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\nThis sequence, while complex and involving a non-obvious Fries rearrangement, is chemically sound and leads to the desired product in high yield by carefully controlling the regiochemistry at each step. Since options A, B, and D are fundamentally flawed, C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent structure:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nThe key feature is the relationship between the substituents. The acetyl group is at position 1. The bromo group is at position 3 (meta to the acetyl group). The nitro group is at position 5 (also meta to the acetyl group). The bromo and nitro groups are meta to each other. This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene derivative.\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order in which substituents are added is crucial, as existing groups on the ring direct the position of new incoming groups during electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** Deactivating (weakly) and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene:** Correct nitration.\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline:** Correct reduction of a nitro group.\n*   **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction does not work on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2+-AlCl3-). This complex is very strongly deactivating, preventing the acylation of the ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence fails at step (iii).\n\n**B) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Benzene → Bromobenzene:** Correct bromination.\n*   **ii) Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene:** Correct nitration. The -Br group is an o,p-director, giving a mixture of ortho and para products, with para being the major one.\n*   **iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group (-NO2). Friedel-Crafts reactions do not proceed on rings bearing a nitro group.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence fails at step (iii).\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.**\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.**\n*   **iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.**\n*   **iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene:** This is a deamination reaction. Steps (i) through (iv) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless loop.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence is illogical for synthesizing the target molecule.\n\n**D) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The product, acetophenone, has a meta-directing acetyl group. This step is correct and high-yield.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group is a meta-director, so bromination occurs at the meta position (position 3). This step is correct and high-yield.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** The ring now has a strong meta-director (-COCH3 at position 1) and a weak o,p-director (-Br at position 3). The powerful meta-directing effect of the acetyl group dominates, directing the incoming nitro group to the other meta position (position 5). This gives the desired target molecule. This is a known and effective transformation.\n*   **Steps iv) - vii):** These steps are performed on the final product. They involve reduction of the nitro group, another nitration, diazotization, and deamination. This sequence is nonsensical for the synthesis of the target molecule and appears to be included as a distractor. The synthesis is effectively complete after step (iii).\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nComparing the four options, only sequence D provides a chemically sound and high-yield route to the target molecule in its first three steps. The other options contain steps that are either impossible under the given conditions or are logically flawed.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each option to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\nThis molecule has three substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are *meta* to each other. This substitution pattern (1,3,5) is crucial for determining the correct synthetic route.\n\n**Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** A deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group (by induction) but an *ortho, para*-director (by resonance).\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** A strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A:**\ni) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene. The -NO2 group is a *meta*-director.\nii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline. The -NH2 group is a strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\niii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation): This reaction does not work well. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2+AlCl3-). This complex is strongly deactivating, making the Friedel-Crafts reaction on the ring fail. The primary reaction would be N-acylation. Thus, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.\nii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline.\niii) Aniline + NaNO2/HCl → Benzenediazonium chloride.\niv) Benzenediazonium chloride + H3PO2 → Benzene. This sequence of reactions (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) simply converts benzene back to benzene, making the first four steps pointless. The synthesis then restarts from benzene.\nv) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.\nvi) Bromobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → 4-Bromoacetophenone (major product, since -Br is an *o,p*-director and para is sterically favored).\nvii) 4-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration. The ring has a -Br at C1 (o,p-director) and a -COCH3 at C4 (m-director). The -Br directs to C2 and C6. The -COCH3 directs to C3 and C5. The directing effects do not align to produce the desired 1,3,5 substitution pattern. The major product would be 4-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone. This is not the target molecule.\n\n**Option D:**\ni) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene. The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\nii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product).\niii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation): This reaction fails. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group (-NO2), and Friedel-Crafts reactions do not proceed on strongly deactivated rings.\n\n**Option C:**\ni) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\nii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3). This step is correct.\niii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration. The ring now has a -COCH3 group at C1 (*meta*-director) and a -Br group at C3 (*ortho, para*-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   The acetyl group is a strong deactivator, making the positions ortho and para to it (C2, C4, C6) much less reactive towards electrophilic attack. The least deactivated position is C5 (meta to the acetyl group). Therefore, nitration will preferentially occur at C5.\n    *   This reaction yields 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which is the desired target molecule.\n\nThe synthesis is successfully completed in these first three steps. The subsequent steps listed in option C (iv to vii) are superfluous for synthesizing the target molecule and are likely an error in the question's formulation. However, since the initial part of sequence C provides a valid and high-yield route to the desired product, and all other options contain fatal flaws, option C is the correct choice.\n\nFinal check:\n1.  Start with benzene.\n2.  Introduce a *meta*-director: Acylation to get acetophenone.\n3.  Introduce a second substituent *meta* to the first: Bromination to get 3-bromoacetophenone.\n4.  Introduce the third substituent: Nitration. The combined directing effects lead to substitution at C5, resulting in the 1,3,5 pattern. This is a logical and effective synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nI have analyzed the reaction sequences and confirmed the key step in option D.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target:** The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This is a benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2). They are in a 1,3,5-relationship (all meta to each other).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Directing Effects:**\n    *   Acetyl (-COCH3): Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   Bromo (-Br): Deactivating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   Nitro (-NO2): Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n3.  **Analyze Option D:**\n    *   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. It correctly adds the acetyl group. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n    *   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-bromoacetophenone:** This is a bromination. The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta-position (C3). This step is correct.\n    *   **iii) 3-bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** This is a nitration. We have two groups on the ring: acetyl at C1 (meta-director) and bromo at C3 (ortho/para-director).\n        *   The acetyl group directs the nitro group to C5.\n        *   The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6.\n        *   As confirmed by the provided information and chemical principles, the directing effect of the acetyl group to the C5 position prevails, leading to the desired 1,3,5-substituted product. This step correctly forms the target molecule.\n\n4.  **Analyze Other Options:**\n    *   **A)** Starts with bromination (o,p-director), so the next substitution (nitration) would primarily give the 1,4-product, not the 1,3-product needed.\n    *   **B)** Starts with nitration, reduction to aniline, and then deamination. This sequence (i-iv) just converts benzene back to benzene, which is illogical.\n    *   **C)** Starts with nitration and reduction to form aniline. Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) fails on the highly activated (and basic) aniline ring.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The sequence of reactions in option D (steps i, ii, and iii) is the only one that correctly synthesizes the target molecule with high yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and incorrect, but the initial, crucial part of the synthesis is correct only in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene requires a careful sequence of reactions to ensure the correct placement of the three substituents on the benzene ring. The key is to consider the directing effects of each group as it is added. The target molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) in a 1,3,5-relationship.\n\nLet's analyze the directing effects of the substituents:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\nA logical and high-yield synthesis route is as follows:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation of Benzene:** The first step is to add the acetyl group to the benzene ring using acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and a Lewis acid catalyst like aluminum chloride (AlCl3). This reaction forms acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which is crucial for placing the next substituents at the 3 and 5 positions.\n    *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone\n\n2.  **Bromination of Acetophenone:** The next step is the bromination of acetophenone using bromine (Br2) and a catalyst like iron(III) bromide (FeBr3). Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the bromine atom will be added to the C3 position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone\n\n3.  **Nitration of 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The final step is the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone using a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Now, we have two directing groups on the ring: the acetyl group at C1 (*meta*-directing) and the bromo group at C3 (*ortho, para*-directing).\n    *   The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position.\n    *   The bromo group directs incoming groups to positions C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   In this case of competing directors, the position that is *meta* to both deactivating groups is the most deactivated. However, the positions that are *meta* to the acetyl group (C5) and *ortho/para* to the bromo group (C2, C4, C6) must be considered. The position C5 is *meta* to the acetyl group and also *meta* to the bromo group. The position C4 is *meta* to the acetyl group and *para* to the bromo group. The position C2 is *meta* to the acetyl group and *ortho* to the bromo group. While complex, the synthesis proceeds to place the nitro group at the C5 position, yielding the final product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This specific substitution pattern is known and the compound is commercially available.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to the first three steps of option C. The additional steps in option C (iv, v, vi, vii) involve reduction of a nitro group, another nitration, and then diazotization and removal of a group, which are unnecessarily complex and incorrect for synthesizing the target molecule which retains a nitro group. However, among the choices provided, the initial sequence of option C is the only chemically sound pathway to begin the synthesis. The question asks for the sequence that *would lead to* the synthesis, and the initial steps of C are the correct ones. The other options contain fundamental flaws in their initial steps:\n\n*   **Option A:** Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (produced in step ii) is problematic without protection of the amino group.\n*   **Option B:** Bromination followed by nitration would lead to a mixture of ortho and para isomers, not the desired meta relationship.\n*   **Option D:** The sequence of reducing a nitro group and then removing the resulting amino group (steps i-iv) would just convert benzene back to benzene, making the sequence nonsensical.\n\nTherefore, the sequence starting with acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration is the most viable route.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents at each step. The target molecule has three substituents—acetyl (-COCH3), bromo (-Br), and nitro (-NO2)—in a 1,3,5-relationship (all meta to each other). This substitution pattern is a key clue.\n\nLet's analyze the directing properties of the groups involved:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Moderately deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Weakly deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n\nThe final product has two *meta*-directors and one *ortho, para*-director, all positioned *meta* to one another. This complex arrangement suggests a multi-step synthesis where directing groups are added, used to control the position of subsequent substitutions, and potentially modified or removed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   Steps i through iv (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. This sequence is redundant and inefficient, making this option incorrect.\n\n**B) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product).\n*   Step iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group and moderately deactivated by the bromo group. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not proceed on strongly deactivated rings. Thus, this step would fail or give a very low yield.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   Step iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. The amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a complex that strongly deactivates the ring, preventing the acylation reaction. This makes the proposed sequence unfeasible.\n\n**C) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nLet's trace this sequence step-by-step:\n1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position.\n3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone:** Now we have a *meta*-directing acetyl group and an *ortho, para*-directing bromo group. The bromo group is less deactivating, so it controls the position of the incoming nitro group, directing it to positions ortho and para relative to itself (positions 2, 4, 6 on the ring). The major product will be the one where the nitro group is at position 4.\n4.  **iv) Product from (iii) + Fe/HCl → 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone:** The nitro group at position 4 is reduced to an amino group (-NH2).\n5.  **v) Product from (iv) + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone:** Now the ring has three substituents: -COCH3 (*m*-director), -Br (*o,p*-director), and -NH2 (strong *o,p*-director). The amino group is the most powerful activating director and will control the substitution. It directs the new nitro group to its ortho positions (positions 3 and 5). Position 3 is already occupied by bromine, so the nitration occurs unambiguously at position 5.\n6.  **vi) Product from (v) + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt:** The amino group at position 4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n7.  **vii) Diazonium salt + H3PO2 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\nThis sequence successfully uses a nitro group (later reduced to an amino group) as a temporary directing group to install the final nitro group in the correct position, and then removes it to yield the desired 1,3,5-substituted product. This is a logical and effective synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is necessary. The target molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) in a 1,3,5-relationship on the benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nThe final 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all groups are *meta* to each other, presents a challenge. A straightforward approach where substituents are added one by one is often complicated by conflicting directing effects or severe deactivation of the ring.\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Synthetic Routes:\n\n1.  **Initial Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This is a good first step as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which can help establish the 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   **Step i: Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This reaction introduces the acetyl group.\n\n2.  **Introduction of the Second and Third Groups:** Now, a nitro group and a bromo group must be added to the acetophenone ring at the 3 and 5 positions. We can consider two possibilities for the second step: nitration or bromination.\n\n    *   **Path A: Nitration followed by Bromination**\n        *   **Step ii: Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the *meta* position.\n        *   **Step iii: 3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** In this step, the ring has two substituents: an acetyl group at position 1 and a nitro group at position 3. Both are *meta*-directors. The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 5. The nitro group also directs the incoming bromine to position 5 (which is *meta* to its own position). Since both groups direct the substitution to the same carbon, this step should proceed with high regioselectivity to yield the desired product. Although the ring is strongly deactivated by two groups, the reinforcing directing effects make this a viable pathway for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n    *   **Path B: Bromination followed by Nitration**\n        *   **Step ii: Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromo group to the *meta* position.\n        *   **Step iii: 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** In this step, the ring has an acetyl group (meta-director) at position 1 and a bromo group (*ortho, para*-director) at position 3. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. Because the directing effects are not reinforcing, a mixture of products could potentially form, making this route less efficient for a high-yield synthesis compared to Path A.\n\n### Conclusion based on Chemical Principles:\nThe most logical and high-yield direct synthesis involves:\n1.  Friedel-Crafts Acylation of benzene to form acetophenone.\n2.  Nitration of acetophenone to form 3-nitroacetophenone.\n3.  Bromination of 3-nitroacetophenone to form the final product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nNow, let's re-examine the provided options. The options are complex and include reduction and diazotization steps, which are often used to overcome directing group conflicts or to introduce groups that cannot be added directly. However, upon detailed analysis:\n*   Options A, C, and D contain steps that are either nonsensical (like creating and then immediately removing a functional group to return to the starting material) or chemically impossible (like performing a Friedel-Crafts reaction on a strongly deactivated ring like nitrobenzene or aniline under acidic conditions).\n*   Option B begins with the sequence: **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4**. This corresponds to the less efficient \"Path B\" discussed above. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) seem to describe a different, unrelated synthesis that would ultimately fail to produce the target molecule.\n\nThere appears to be a significant flaw in the construction of the options provided. However, if forced to choose the *best* starting sequence that could theoretically lead to the product, the initial steps are the most critical. The sequence of acylation, followed by two successive electrophilic aromatic substitutions, is the correct strategy. The sequence in Path A (Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination) is superior in terms of regioselectivity. None of the options list this exact sequence. The sequence in Path B (Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration) is plausible, although potentially lower-yielding. This sequence matches the beginning of option B. Given the flaws in the other options, option B presents the only plausible, albeit imperfect, starting point.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in option B and the intended sequence was Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination. Or, that despite the conflicting directing effects, the sequence Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration is considered viable. The additional steps (iv-vii) in option B are extraneous and incorrect for the synthesis of the target compound. Based on the initial plausible steps, B is the only choice that starts correctly with a Friedel-Crafts acylation on benzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a refined analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Substituent Effects**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It has three substituents on a benzene ring at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nThe key challenge is installing these three groups with the correct 1,3,5-relationship, especially given the mix of *meta* and *ortho, para* directors. A simple sequential electrophilic aromatic substitution is unlikely to be high-yield.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's analyze the key steps of each sequence to determine its viability for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Option C: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    1.  Benzene → Acetophenone (Friedel-Crafts Acylation).\n    2.  Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone (Bromination). The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, so this step is regioselective.\n    3.  3-Bromoacetophenone → Nitration. At this crucial step, the ring has two substituents: -COCH3 (a *meta*-director) and -Br (an *ortho, para*-director).\n        *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n        *   The -Br group directs the incoming -NO2 group to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    Since the directing effects are conflicting, this step will produce a mixture of several isomers, significantly lowering the yield of the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Therefore, this is not a high-yield route.\n\n*   **Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    1.  Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n    2.  Bromobenzene → 4-Bromonitrobenzene (Nitration, para is major).\n    3.  4-Bromonitrobenzene → Acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group, making Friedel-Crafts acylation very difficult. Even if it worked, the substitution would occur *ortho* to the bromine, leading to a 1,2,4-substitution pattern, not the required 1,3,5 pattern. This route is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...**\n    1.  The first four steps convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, which is then converted to a diazonium salt and finally reduced back to benzene via deamination. This sequence accomplishes nothing and is nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    This sequence uses a sophisticated strategy involving a temporary directing group that is later removed.\n    1.  **i) & ii):** Benzene is nitrated and then reduced to form aniline. The amino group (-NH2) is a powerful *ortho, para*-director.\n    2.  **iii):** This step should be interpreted as protection of the amine (forming acetanilide, -NHCOCH3) followed by Friedel-Crafts acylation. The powerful *o,p*-directing acetamido group directs the acylation to the *para* position, forming 4-acetamidoacetophenone.\n    3.  **iv) Bromination:** The ring has a strongly activating *o,p*-director (-NHCOCH3) and a deactivating *m*-director (-COCH3). Both groups direct the incoming bromine to the position *ortho* to the acetamido group (position 3), resulting in high regioselectivity.\n    4.  **v) Nitration:** The ring now has three groups: -NHCOCH3 (*o,p*), -Br (*o,p*), and -COCH3 (*m*). All three groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same available position (position 5). This reinforcing effect ensures a very high yield of a single isomer.\n    5.  **vi) & vii):** These steps (preceded by an implicit hydrolysis of the acetamide to an amine) achieve the removal of the temporary amino/acetamido directing group via diazotization and deamination, yielding the final product.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOnly sequence A provides a rational, high-yield pathway by using a temporary directing group (-NH2/-NHCOCH3) to control the regiochemistry of subsequent substitutions through reinforcing directing effects. The other options fail due to low yields from conflicting directors (C), incorrect regiochemistry (B), or being nonsensical (D).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is necessary. The target molecule has three substituents—acetyl (-COCH3), bromo (-Br), and nitro (-NO2)—all in a *meta* relationship to each other (positions 1, 3, and 5).\n\n**Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** A deactivating group that directs incoming substituents to the *meta* position.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group that directs incoming substituents to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** A strongly deactivating group that directs incoming substituents to the *meta* position.\n\n**Evaluation of the Proposed Sequences:**\n\n*   **Option A and C:** These sequences begin with nitration to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Aniline's amino group (-NH2) is a strong *ortho, para*-director. Subsequent reactions, such as Friedel-Crafts acylation (which fails on anilines without protection) or bromination, would not lead to the required 1,3,5-substitution pattern. Therefore, these options are incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence starts with the bromination of benzene to form bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The next step, nitration, would predominantly yield *p*-bromonitrobenzene, which does not have the necessary *meta* relationship between the substituents. This makes option B an unviable route.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence begins with the Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene to produce acetophenone.\n    1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position (position 3), which is consistent with the target molecule's structure.\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** At this stage, the benzene ring has an acetyl group at position 1 and a bromo group at position 3. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director (directing to position 5), and the bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director (directing to positions 5 and 1). Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. This reinforcement of directing effects leads to the selective formation of the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis three-step sequence (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) is the most logical and effective pathway among the choices to achieve the specific 1,3,5-substitution pattern. While Friedel-Crafts reactions are generally difficult on deactivated rings, this sequence introduces the deactivating groups in an order that maintains sufficient reactivity for each subsequent step while ensuring the correct regiochemistry. The additional steps listed in option D (iv through vii) are superfluous as the target molecule is successfully synthesized in the first three steps. Their inclusion appears to be a distractor, as the initial three-step sequence is chemically sound and directly produces the target compound with high regioselectivity, which implies a high yield of the desired isomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe user has confirmed the previous analysis was correct.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nProposer: The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) at positions 1, 3, and 5, respectively. All substituents are meta to each other.\n\nA straightforward approach would be a sequence of three electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. Let's analyze the directing effects of the groups:\n*   -COCH3 (acetyl): deactivating, meta-director.\n*   -Br (bromo): deactivating, ortho/para-director.\n*   -NO2 (nitro): deactivating, meta-director.\n\nLet's propose a simple synthesis path:\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene reacts with `CH3COCl/AlCl3` to form acetophenone. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone is nitrated with `HNO3/H2SO4`. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the meta position, yielding 3-nitroacetophenone.\n3.  **Bromination:** 3-nitroacetophenone is brominated with `Br2/FeBr3`. In this molecule, both the acetyl group (at C1) and the nitro group (at C3) are meta-directors. They both direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the C5 position.\n\nThis sequence (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) should produce the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one with high regioselectivity.\n\nHowever, none of the options provided match this simple three-step synthesis. The options include steps like reduction of a nitro group (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), and deamination (`H3PO2`), suggesting a more complex route is intended, likely to circumvent a low-yield step in the simple path. The potential low-yield step in my proposed synthesis is the final bromination, as the ring is strongly deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups (-COCH3 and -NO2), which would require harsh conditions.\n\nLet's analyze the provided options to see if they present a viable, high-yield alternative.\n\nSkeptic: The proposed simple path (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is chemically sound in terms of regioselectivity, but the final bromination on a heavily deactivated ring is a valid concern for achieving high yield. The complex reaction sequences in the options suggest this is the problem to be solved. Let's critically evaluate each option.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3` (Acetophenone) → `ii) Br2/FeBr3` (3-bromoacetophenone) → `iii) HNO3/H2SO4`. In step (iii), the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone, the directing effects of the -COCH3 (meta) and -Br (ortho, para) groups are in conflict. The -COCH3 group directs to position 5, while the -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. This would lead to a mixture of products and thus a low yield of the desired isomer, making this path inefficient. The subsequent steps make no sense in the context of creating the target molecule.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) Br2/FeBr3` (Bromobenzene) → `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`. The nitration of bromobenzene yields primarily the para isomer (1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene) and some ortho isomer. The desired meta relationship is not achieved. Furthermore, step `iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3` (Friedel-Crafts acylation) would fail or have a very low yield on the strongly deactivated 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene ring. This path is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitrobenzene) → `ii) Fe/HCl` (Aniline) → `iii) NaNO2/HCl` (Diazonium salt) → `iv) H3PO2` (Benzene). This sequence of reactions simply converts benzene to aniline and then back to benzene, achieving nothing. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitrobenzene) → `ii) Fe/HCl` (Aniline) → `iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3`... This sequence is problematic from step (iii). Friedel-Crafts acylation (`CH3COCl/AlCl3`) cannot be performed on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring entirely. If this step is a typo for the protection of the amine to form acetanilide, the subsequent steps (as analyzed in the thought process) lead to 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene, not the final target which also needs an acetyl group.\n\nAll provided options appear to be flawed based on standard organic chemistry principles. There might be a typo in the question or the options. The most logical and regioselective synthesis is the simple three-step pathway I initially proposed: Acylation → Nitration → Bromination. Despite the potential for a slow final step, it is the only one that directs all substituents to the correct positions without ambiguity. If forced to choose the \"best\" sequence of reactions that *should* be listed, it is this three-step route. Since none of the options reflect this or any other valid complex pathway, there is an error in the question's premise.\n\nHowever, if we must assume there is a correct answer among the choices and re-evaluate, we must reconsider the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone (Option A, step iii). While the directing groups are conflicting, it's possible that the deactivating -COCH3 group's meta-directing effect to position 5 is dominant enough to provide a reasonable yield, making it the \"least wrong\" option among a set of flawed choices. But the subsequent steps in A (reduction, nitration again) are nonsensical.\n\nGiven the severe flaws in all options, a definitive answer cannot be reached. The question or options are likely incorrect. The most chemically sound synthesis is not listed.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in option A and the reaction sequence is only the first three steps.\ni) `CH3COCl/AlCl3` ; ii) `Br2/FeBr3` ; iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`\nThis would produce 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, but as discussed, step ii -> iii has conflicting directors.\n\nLet's reconsider the simple path: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.\n1. Benzene -> Acetophenone\n2. Acetophenone -> 3-Nitroacetophenone\n3. 3-Nitroacetophenone -> 3-Bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.\nThis path is the most logical. Let's re-examine the options to see if any can be interpreted as this path. None can.\n\nLet's step back and reconsider the initial bromination and nitration order.\nPath: Nitration -> Bromination -> Acylation\n1. Benzene -> Nitrobenzene\n2. Nitrobenzene -> 1-Bromo-3-nitrobenzene\n3. 1-Bromo-3-nitrobenzene -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\nThis path has perfect regioselectivity. The only issue is the final Friedel-Crafts acylation on a deactivated ring. This is often cited as a major limitation.\n\nComparing the two most plausible routes:\nRoute 1: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination (final step is slow)\nRoute 2: Nitration -> Bromination -> Acylation (final step is slow/fails)\n\nBetween the two, bromination on a ring with two deactivating groups (Route 1) is generally considered more feasible than Friedel-Crafts acylation on a similarly deactivated ring (Route 2). Therefore, the sequence Acylation → Nitration → Bromination is the superior theoretical pathway. Since this is not an option, and all given options contain significant chemical errors, a correct answer cannot be determined from the choices.\n\nFinal decision based on re-evaluation: All options are critically flawed. There is no correct sequence among the choices. The problem is ill-posed. However, in a multiple-choice scenario where a \"best\" fit must be found, it's impossible to logically justify any of the given sequences.\n\n<<<No correct option can be determined from the provided choices as they all contain significant chemical errors or nonsensical steps.>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order of reactions is critical and depends on how each substituent directs the next incoming group during electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n    *   The first four steps (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination with H3PO2) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. This is a chemically pointless loop, making the sequence incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    *   Step i) produces bromobenzene.\n    *   Step ii) nitration of bromobenzene gives mainly the *para* product (1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene), not the required *meta* relationship.\n    *   Step iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring that is strongly deactivated by a nitro group. This reaction would fail or give an extremely low yield. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    *   Steps i) and ii) produce aniline from benzene.\n    *   Step iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a strongly deactivated complex and preventing the acylation of the ring. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    *   This sequence represents a valid, albeit complex, high-yield synthesis that uses a temporary directing group.\n    *   **i) Benzene → Acetophenone:** The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    *   **ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group correctly directs the bromine to the *meta* position.\n    *   **iii) Nitration of 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). Their effects conflict, leading to a mixture of products. The *ortho, para*-directing halogen tends to control the substitution, leading to the formation of 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone as a major product. This is not the final target, but an intermediate.\n    *   **iv) Reduction:** The nitro group at position 4 is reduced to an amino group (-NH2), forming 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone.\n    *   **v) Nitration:** The ring now has a powerful activating *ortho, para*-director (-NH2). This group's effect dominates all others, directing the new nitro group to its open *ortho* position (position 5). This step is highly regioselective. The product is 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone.\n    *   **vi) Diazotization:** The amino group at position 4 is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    *   **vii) Deamination:** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom using H3PO2. This removes the temporary directing group.\n    *   **Final Product:** The sequence correctly yields 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOptions A, C, and D contain chemically flawed steps (pointless loops or reactions that fail under the given conditions). Option B describes a multi-step synthesis that, while complex, is chemically sound and uses established techniques (temporary directing groups, diazotization/deamination) to overcome the challenge of conflicting directing effects and achieve a high yield of the specific 1,3,5-trisubstituted product.\n\n<<<B>>>"

This requires careful consideration of the directing effects of each group.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Substituent Effects**:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3)**: This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br)**: This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2)**: This is a strong deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\n2.  **Evaluation of Synthetic Routes**: The goal is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene. This substitution pattern is achieved when *meta*-directing groups are used to guide subsequent additions.\n\n    *   **Starting with Bromination or Nitration**: If the first step were bromination (as in option C), the bromo group would direct the next substituent to the *ortho* and *para* positions, which is incorrect for the desired 1,3,5-pattern. If the first step were nitration (as in options A and B), the nitro group would correctly direct the next substituent to the *meta* position. However, a major limitation of the Friedel-Crafts acylation is that it fails on strongly deactivated rings like nitrobenzene. Therefore, adding the acetyl group after nitration is not feasible.\n\n    *   **Starting with Friedel-Crafts Acylation (Option D)**: This is the most logical first step.\n        *   **Step i) CH3COCl/AlCl3**: Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n        *   **Step ii) Br2/FeBr3**: The acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position. This reaction yields 3-bromoacetophenone, correctly establishing the 1,3-relationship.\n        *   **Step iii) HNO3/H2SO4**: The final step is the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. Now, the ring has two directing groups: the *meta*-directing acetyl group and the *ortho, para*-directing bromo group. The acetyl group directs the new nitro group to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. The only position where their directing effects align is position 5 (*meta* to the acetyl group and *ortho* to the bromo group). This synergistic effect leads to the high-yield synthesis of the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe subsequent steps listed in option D (iv through vii) are unnecessary for creating the final product and appear to be erroneous. However, the initial three steps of option D represent the only chemically sound and high-yield pathway to the desired compound among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful sequence of reactions is required to ensure the substituents are placed at the correct positions (1, 3, and 5). This involves considering the directing effects of each group added to the benzene ring. The target molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) all in a meta relationship to each other.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the most effective synthesis strategy, which aligns with the steps presented in one of the options:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** The first step is to add the acetyl group to the benzene ring. This is achieved by reacting benzene with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst like aluminum chloride (AlCl3). This reaction forms acetophenone. The acetyl group is a meta-director and deactivates the ring for subsequent electrophilic substitutions.\n\n2.  **Bromination:** The second step is the bromination of acetophenone. Since the acetyl group is a meta-director, it will direct the incoming bromine atom to the meta (position 3) position. This reaction is carried out using bromine (Br2) and a Lewis acid catalyst such as iron(III) bromide (FeBr3), yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n\n3.  **Nitration:** The final step is to introduce the nitro group. At this stage, the benzene ring has two substituents: an acetyl group at position 1 (meta-director) and a bromine atom at position 3 (ortho-, para-director).\n    *   The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n    *   The bromo group directs incoming groups to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   When directing effects are in conflict, the position that is least sterically hindered and electronically favored will be the major product. In this case, both existing groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. The acetyl group strongly directs meta to itself, and the bromo group directs ortho/para. Position 5 is ortho to the bromine and meta to the acetyl group. More importantly, in a 1,3-disubstituted ring, substitution at the 5-position is strongly favored as both groups direct the incoming electrophile to this position. This reaction, using a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), yields the final product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis three-step sequence is the most direct and high-yield pathway. However, the options provided are more complex, suggesting a misunderstanding in the premise of the question options. Based on the most chemically sound principles for achieving the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern, a sequence starting with acylation, followed by the introduction of the other two groups, is the correct approach. The other options fail because they either perform Friedel-Crafts acylation on a heavily deactivated ring (which is not feasible), or they follow a sequence of directing effects that would not lead to the 1,3,5-product.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the provided options based on this correct three-step synthesis: `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4`. This sequence is a truncated version of option D. The additional steps in option D (reduction, nitration, diazotization, deamination) are nonsensical and incorrect in that order. However, since the initial three steps of option D are the only chemically logical start to forming a 1,3,5-substituted acetophenone derivative, it is the most plausible choice despite its flawed later steps.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each option to determine the correct sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule:**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are meta to each other. Let's analyze their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   -COCH3: meta-director, deactivating.\n*   -Br: ortho,para-director, deactivating.\n*   -NO2: meta-director, strongly deactivating.\n\nThe presence of an ortho,para-director (-Br) meta to two meta-directors makes direct substitution challenging. This often requires a more complex strategy, possibly involving the use of a temporary directing group that is later removed or modified (e.g., via a Sandmeyer reaction). The presence of reagents like Fe/HCl, NaNO2/HCl, and H3PO2 in the options strongly suggests such a strategy is employed.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline (reduction)\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride (diazotization)\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene (deamination with H3PO2)\nThis sequence of steps i-iv starts with benzene and ends with benzene, making it a pointless loop. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene\n*   ii) Bromobenzene → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product) and o-bromonitrobenzene.\n*   iii) p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails or gives very low yields on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a nitro group. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene → Acetophenone\n*   ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone (The acetyl group is a meta-director).\n*   iii) Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. The substituents are -COCH3 (meta-director) at C1 and -Br (ortho,para-director) at C3. The directing effects are conflicting. The -Br group directs nitration to positions 2, 4, and 6, while the -COCH3 group directs to position 5. The o,p-directing effect of the halogen will dominate, leading to a mixture of 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one and 1-(3-bromo-6-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one would not be the major product. This is not a high-yield synthesis. Thus, option D is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nThis sequence is complex but represents a valid, albeit sophisticated, synthetic strategy. Let's break it down. The final steps (vi, vii) are diazotization and deamination, which remove an amino group. This is a powerful technique to achieve substitution patterns that are otherwise inaccessible. The synthesis likely involves creating a precursor with an extra amino group, which is then removed.\n\nHere is the plausible reaction pathway for option C:\n1.  **i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene**\n2.  **ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline**\n3.  **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl → Acetanilide.** This is an N-acylation to protect the amino group. The acetyl group makes the amine less activating and sterically hinders it. (Note: AlCl3 is typically used for Friedel-Crafts C-acylation, not N-acylation, and would problematically complex with the amine. Its inclusion here is likely to indicate it will be used for a later Fries rearrangement step).\n4.  **iv) Acetanilide + Br2/FeBr3 → 4-Bromoacetanilide.** The -NHCOCH3 group is an ortho,para-director, and the para product is major due to less steric hindrance.\n5.  **v) 4-Bromoacetanilide + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-Bromo-2-nitroacetanilide.** The activating -NHCOCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to its ortho position (C2), which is also meta to the bromo group.\n6.  **Fries Rearrangement:** The product from step v, 4-bromo-2-nitroacetanilide, is treated with the Lewis acid **AlCl3** (from step iii). This causes the acetyl group to migrate from the nitrogen atom to the ring, typically ortho to the amino group. This yields **1-(2-amino-5-bromo-3-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n7.  **vi) Diazotization:** The resulting primary amine, 1-(2-amino-5-bromo-3-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, is treated with **NaNO2/HCl** to form a diazonium salt.\n8.  **vii) Deamination:** The diazonium salt is treated with **H3PO2** to remove the diazonium group and replace it with a hydrogen atom. This removes the temporary amino group from position 2.\n\nThe final product is **1-(5-bromo-3-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, which is the same molecule as the target, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\nThis sequence, while complex and involving a non-obvious Fries rearrangement, is chemically sound and leads to the desired product in high yield by carefully controlling the regiochemistry at each step. Since options A, B, and D are fundamentally flawed, C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent structure:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nThe key feature is the relationship between the substituents. The acetyl group is at position 1. The bromo group is at position 3 (meta to the acetyl group). The nitro group is at position 5 (also meta to the acetyl group). The bromo and nitro groups are meta to each other. This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene derivative.\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order in which substituents are added is crucial, as existing groups on the ring direct the position of new incoming groups during electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** Deactivating (weakly) and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene:** Correct nitration.\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline:** Correct reduction of a nitro group.\n*   **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction does not work on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2+-AlCl3-). This complex is very strongly deactivating, preventing the acylation of the ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence fails at step (iii).\n\n**B) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Benzene → Bromobenzene:** Correct bromination.\n*   **ii) Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene:** Correct nitration. The -Br group is an o,p-director, giving a mixture of ortho and para products, with para being the major one.\n*   **iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group (-NO2). Friedel-Crafts reactions do not proceed on rings bearing a nitro group.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence fails at step (iii).\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.**\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.**\n*   **iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.**\n*   **iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene:** This is a deamination reaction. Steps (i) through (iv) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless loop.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence is illogical for synthesizing the target molecule.\n\n**D) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The product, acetophenone, has a meta-directing acetyl group. This step is correct and high-yield.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group is a meta-director, so bromination occurs at the meta position (position 3). This step is correct and high-yield.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** The ring now has a strong meta-director (-COCH3 at position 1) and a weak o,p-director (-Br at position 3). The powerful meta-directing effect of the acetyl group dominates, directing the incoming nitro group to the other meta position (position 5). This gives the desired target molecule. This is a known and effective transformation.\n*   **Steps iv) - vii):** These steps are performed on the final product. They involve reduction of the nitro group, another nitration, diazotization, and deamination. This sequence is nonsensical for the synthesis of the target molecule and appears to be included as a distractor. The synthesis is effectively complete after step (iii).\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nComparing the four options, only sequence D provides a chemically sound and high-yield route to the target molecule in its first three steps. The other options contain steps that are either impossible under the given conditions or are logically flawed.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each option to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\nThis molecule has three substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are *meta* to each other. This substitution pattern (1,3,5) is crucial for determining the correct synthetic route.\n\n**Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** A deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group (by induction) but an *ortho, para*-director (by resonance).\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** A strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A:**\ni) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene. The -NO2 group is a *meta*-director.\nii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline. The -NH2 group is a strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\niii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation): This reaction does not work well. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2+AlCl3-). This complex is strongly deactivating, making the Friedel-Crafts reaction on the ring fail. The primary reaction would be N-acylation. Thus, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.\nii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline.\niii) Aniline + NaNO2/HCl → Benzenediazonium chloride.\niv) Benzenediazonium chloride + H3PO2 → Benzene. This sequence of reactions (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) simply converts benzene back to benzene, making the first four steps pointless. The synthesis then restarts from benzene.\nv) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.\nvi) Bromobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → 4-Bromoacetophenone (major product, since -Br is an *o,p*-director and para is sterically favored).\nvii) 4-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration. The ring has a -Br at C1 (o,p-director) and a -COCH3 at C4 (m-director). The -Br directs to C2 and C6. The -COCH3 directs to C3 and C5. The directing effects do not align to produce the desired 1,3,5 substitution pattern. The major product would be 4-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone. This is not the target molecule.\n\n**Option D:**\ni) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene. The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\nii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product).\niii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation): This reaction fails. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group (-NO2), and Friedel-Crafts reactions do not proceed on strongly deactivated rings.\n\n**Option C:**\ni) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\nii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3). This step is correct.\niii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration. The ring now has a -COCH3 group at C1 (*meta*-director) and a -Br group at C3 (*ortho, para*-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   The acetyl group is a strong deactivator, making the positions ortho and para to it (C2, C4, C6) much less reactive towards electrophilic attack. The least deactivated position is C5 (meta to the acetyl group). Therefore, nitration will preferentially occur at C5.\n    *   This reaction yields 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which is the desired target molecule.\n\nThe synthesis is successfully completed in these first three steps. The subsequent steps listed in option C (iv to vii) are superfluous for synthesizing the target molecule and are likely an error in the question's formulation. However, since the initial part of sequence C provides a valid and high-yield route to the desired product, and all other options contain fatal flaws, option C is the correct choice.\n\nFinal check:\n1.  Start with benzene.\n2.  Introduce a *meta*-director: Acylation to get acetophenone.\n3.  Introduce a second substituent *meta* to the first: Bromination to get 3-bromoacetophenone.\n4.  Introduce the third substituent: Nitration. The combined directing effects lead to substitution at C5, resulting in the 1,3,5 pattern. This is a logical and effective synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nI have analyzed the reaction sequences and confirmed the key step in option D.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target:** The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This is a benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2). They are in a 1,3,5-relationship (all meta to each other).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Directing Effects:**\n    *   Acetyl (-COCH3): Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   Bromo (-Br): Deactivating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   Nitro (-NO2): Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n3.  **Analyze Option D:**\n    *   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. It correctly adds the acetyl group. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n    *   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-bromoacetophenone:** This is a bromination. The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta-position (C3). This step is correct.\n    *   **iii) 3-bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** This is a nitration. We have two groups on the ring: acetyl at C1 (meta-director) and bromo at C3 (ortho/para-director).\n        *   The acetyl group directs the nitro group to C5.\n        *   The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6.\n        *   As confirmed by the provided information and chemical principles, the directing effect of the acetyl group to the C5 position prevails, leading to the desired 1,3,5-substituted product. This step correctly forms the target molecule.\n\n4.  **Analyze Other Options:**\n    *   **A)** Starts with bromination (o,p-director), so the next substitution (nitration) would primarily give the 1,4-product, not the 1,3-product needed.\n    *   **B)** Starts with nitration, reduction to aniline, and then deamination. This sequence (i-iv) just converts benzene back to benzene, which is illogical.\n    *   **C)** Starts with nitration and reduction to form aniline. Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) fails on the highly activated (and basic) aniline ring.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The sequence of reactions in option D (steps i, ii, and iii) is the only one that correctly synthesizes the target molecule with high yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and incorrect, but the initial, crucial part of the synthesis is correct only in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene requires a careful sequence of reactions to ensure the correct placement of the three substituents on the benzene ring. The key is to consider the directing effects of each group as it is added. The target molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) in a 1,3,5-relationship.\n\nLet's analyze the directing effects of the substituents:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\nA logical and high-yield synthesis route is as follows:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation of Benzene:** The first step is to add the acetyl group to the benzene ring using acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and a Lewis acid catalyst like aluminum chloride (AlCl3). This reaction forms acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which is crucial for placing the next substituents at the 3 and 5 positions.\n    *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone\n\n2.  **Bromination of Acetophenone:** The next step is the bromination of acetophenone using bromine (Br2) and a catalyst like iron(III) bromide (FeBr3). Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the bromine atom will be added to the C3 position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone\n\n3.  **Nitration of 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The final step is the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone using a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Now, we have two directing groups on the ring: the acetyl group at C1 (*meta*-directing) and the bromo group at C3 (*ortho, para*-directing).\n    *   The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position.\n    *   The bromo group directs incoming groups to positions C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   In this case of competing directors, the position that is *meta* to both deactivating groups is the most deactivated. However, the positions that are *meta* to the acetyl group (C5) and *ortho/para* to the bromo group (C2, C4, C6) must be considered. The position C5 is *meta* to the acetyl group and also *meta* to the bromo group. The position C4 is *meta* to the acetyl group and *para* to the bromo group. The position C2 is *meta* to the acetyl group and *ortho* to the bromo group. While complex, the synthesis proceeds to place the nitro group at the C5 position, yielding the final product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This specific substitution pattern is known and the compound is commercially available.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to the first three steps of option C. The additional steps in option C (iv, v, vi, vii) involve reduction of a nitro group, another nitration, and then diazotization and removal of a group, which are unnecessarily complex and incorrect for synthesizing the target molecule which retains a nitro group. However, among the choices provided, the initial sequence of option C is the only chemically sound pathway to begin the synthesis. The question asks for the sequence that *would lead to* the synthesis, and the initial steps of C are the correct ones. The other options contain fundamental flaws in their initial steps:\n\n*   **Option A:** Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (produced in step ii) is problematic without protection of the amino group.\n*   **Option B:** Bromination followed by nitration would lead to a mixture of ortho and para isomers, not the desired meta relationship.\n*   **Option D:** The sequence of reducing a nitro group and then removing the resulting amino group (steps i-iv) would just convert benzene back to benzene, making the sequence nonsensical.\n\nTherefore, the sequence starting with acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration is the most viable route.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents at each step. The target molecule has three substituents—acetyl (-COCH3), bromo (-Br), and nitro (-NO2)—in a 1,3,5-relationship (all meta to each other). This substitution pattern is a key clue.\n\nLet's analyze the directing properties of the groups involved:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Moderately deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Weakly deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n\nThe final product has two *meta*-directors and one *ortho, para*-director, all positioned *meta* to one another. This complex arrangement suggests a multi-step synthesis where directing groups are added, used to control the position of subsequent substitutions, and potentially modified or removed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   Steps i through iv (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. This sequence is redundant and inefficient, making this option incorrect.\n\n**B) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product).\n*   Step iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group and moderately deactivated by the bromo group. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not proceed on strongly deactivated rings. Thus, this step would fail or give a very low yield.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   Step iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. The amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a complex that strongly deactivates the ring, preventing the acylation reaction. This makes the proposed sequence unfeasible.\n\n**C) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nLet's trace this sequence step-by-step:\n1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position.\n3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone:** Now we have a *meta*-directing acetyl group and an *ortho, para*-directing bromo group. The bromo group is less deactivating, so it controls the position of the incoming nitro group, directing it to positions ortho and para relative to itself (positions 2, 4, 6 on the ring). The major product will be the one where the nitro group is at position 4.\n4.  **iv) Product from (iii) + Fe/HCl → 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone:** The nitro group at position 4 is reduced to an amino group (-NH2).\n5.  **v) Product from (iv) + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone:** Now the ring has three substituents: -COCH3 (*m*-director), -Br (*o,p*-director), and -NH2 (strong *o,p*-director). The amino group is the most powerful activating director and will control the substitution. It directs the new nitro group to its ortho positions (positions 3 and 5). Position 3 is already occupied by bromine, so the nitration occurs unambiguously at position 5.\n6.  **vi) Product from (v) + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt:** The amino group at position 4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n7.  **vii) Diazonium salt + H3PO2 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\nThis sequence successfully uses a nitro group (later reduced to an amino group) as a temporary directing group to install the final nitro group in the correct position, and then removes it to yield the desired 1,3,5-substituted product. This is a logical and effective synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is necessary. The target molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) in a 1,3,5-relationship on the benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nThe final 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all groups are *meta* to each other, presents a challenge. A straightforward approach where substituents are added one by one is often complicated by conflicting directing effects or severe deactivation of the ring.\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Synthetic Routes:\n\n1.  **Initial Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This is a good first step as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which can help establish the 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   **Step i: Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This reaction introduces the acetyl group.\n\n2.  **Introduction of the Second and Third Groups:** Now, a nitro group and a bromo group must be added to the acetophenone ring at the 3 and 5 positions. We can consider two possibilities for the second step: nitration or bromination.\n\n    *   **Path A: Nitration followed by Bromination**\n        *   **Step ii: Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the *meta* position.\n        *   **Step iii: 3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** In this step, the ring has two substituents: an acetyl group at position 1 and a nitro group at position 3. Both are *meta*-directors. The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 5. The nitro group also directs the incoming bromine to position 5 (which is *meta* to its own position). Since both groups direct the substitution to the same carbon, this step should proceed with high regioselectivity to yield the desired product. Although the ring is strongly deactivated by two groups, the reinforcing directing effects make this a viable pathway for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n    *   **Path B: Bromination followed by Nitration**\n        *   **Step ii: Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromo group to the *meta* position.\n        *   **Step iii: 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** In this step, the ring has an acetyl group (meta-director) at position 1 and a bromo group (*ortho, para*-director) at position 3. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. Because the directing effects are not reinforcing, a mixture of products could potentially form, making this route less efficient for a high-yield synthesis compared to Path A.\n\n### Conclusion based on Chemical Principles:\nThe most logical and high-yield direct synthesis involves:\n1.  Friedel-Crafts Acylation of benzene to form acetophenone.\n2.  Nitration of acetophenone to form 3-nitroacetophenone.\n3.  Bromination of 3-nitroacetophenone to form the final product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nNow, let's re-examine the provided options. The options are complex and include reduction and diazotization steps, which are often used to overcome directing group conflicts or to introduce groups that cannot be added directly. However, upon detailed analysis:\n*   Options A, C, and D contain steps that are either nonsensical (like creating and then immediately removing a functional group to return to the starting material) or chemically impossible (like performing a Friedel-Crafts reaction on a strongly deactivated ring like nitrobenzene or aniline under acidic conditions).\n*   Option B begins with the sequence: **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4**. This corresponds to the less efficient \"Path B\" discussed above. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) seem to describe a different, unrelated synthesis that would ultimately fail to produce the target molecule.\n\nThere appears to be a significant flaw in the construction of the options provided. However, if forced to choose the *best* starting sequence that could theoretically lead to the product, the initial steps are the most critical. The sequence of acylation, followed by two successive electrophilic aromatic substitutions, is the correct strategy. The sequence in Path A (Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination) is superior in terms of regioselectivity. None of the options list this exact sequence. The sequence in Path B (Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration) is plausible, although potentially lower-yielding. This sequence matches the beginning of option B. Given the flaws in the other options, option B presents the only plausible, albeit imperfect, starting point.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in option B and the intended sequence was Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination. Or, that despite the conflicting directing effects, the sequence Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration is considered viable. The additional steps (iv-vii) in option B are extraneous and incorrect for the synthesis of the target compound. Based on the initial plausible steps, B is the only choice that starts correctly with a Friedel-Crafts acylation on benzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a refined analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Substituent Effects**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It has three substituents on a benzene ring at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nThe key challenge is installing these three groups with the correct 1,3,5-relationship, especially given the mix of *meta* and *ortho, para* directors. A simple sequential electrophilic aromatic substitution is unlikely to be high-yield.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's analyze the key steps of each sequence to determine its viability for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Option C: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    1.  Benzene → Acetophenone (Friedel-Crafts Acylation).\n    2.  Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone (Bromination). The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, so this step is regioselective.\n    3.  3-Bromoacetophenone → Nitration. At this crucial step, the ring has two substituents: -COCH3 (a *meta*-director) and -Br (an *ortho, para*-director).\n        *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n        *   The -Br group directs the incoming -NO2 group to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    Since the directing effects are conflicting, this step will produce a mixture of several isomers, significantly lowering the yield of the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Therefore, this is not a high-yield route.\n\n*   **Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    1.  Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n    2.  Bromobenzene → 4-Bromonitrobenzene (Nitration, para is major).\n    3.  4-Bromonitrobenzene → Acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group, making Friedel-Crafts acylation very difficult. Even if it worked, the substitution would occur *ortho* to the bromine, leading to a 1,2,4-substitution pattern, not the required 1,3,5 pattern. This route is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...**\n    1.  The first four steps convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, which is then converted to a diazonium salt and finally reduced back to benzene via deamination. This sequence accomplishes nothing and is nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    This sequence uses a sophisticated strategy involving a temporary directing group that is later removed.\n    1.  **i) & ii):** Benzene is nitrated and then reduced to form aniline. The amino group (-NH2) is a powerful *ortho, para*-director.\n    2.  **iii):** This step should be interpreted as protection of the amine (forming acetanilide, -NHCOCH3) followed by Friedel-Crafts acylation. The powerful *o,p*-directing acetamido group directs the acylation to the *para* position, forming 4-acetamidoacetophenone.\n    3.  **iv) Bromination:** The ring has a strongly activating *o,p*-director (-NHCOCH3) and a deactivating *m*-director (-COCH3). Both groups direct the incoming bromine to the position *ortho* to the acetamido group (position 3), resulting in high regioselectivity.\n    4.  **v) Nitration:** The ring now has three groups: -NHCOCH3 (*o,p*), -Br (*o,p*), and -COCH3 (*m*). All three groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same available position (position 5). This reinforcing effect ensures a very high yield of a single isomer.\n    5.  **vi) & vii):** These steps (preceded by an implicit hydrolysis of the acetamide to an amine) achieve the removal of the temporary amino/acetamido directing group via diazotization and deamination, yielding the final product.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOnly sequence A provides a rational, high-yield pathway by using a temporary directing group (-NH2/-NHCOCH3) to control the regiochemistry of subsequent substitutions through reinforcing directing effects. The other options fail due to low yields from conflicting directors (C), incorrect regiochemistry (B), or being nonsensical (D).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is necessary. The target molecule has three substituents—acetyl (-COCH3), bromo (-Br), and nitro (-NO2)—all in a *meta* relationship to each other (positions 1, 3, and 5).\n\n**Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** A deactivating group that directs incoming substituents to the *meta* position.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group that directs incoming substituents to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** A strongly deactivating group that directs incoming substituents to the *meta* position.\n\n**Evaluation of the Proposed Sequences:**\n\n*   **Option A and C:** These sequences begin with nitration to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Aniline's amino group (-NH2) is a strong *ortho, para*-director. Subsequent reactions, such as Friedel-Crafts acylation (which fails on anilines without protection) or bromination, would not lead to the required 1,3,5-substitution pattern. Therefore, these options are incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence starts with the bromination of benzene to form bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The next step, nitration, would predominantly yield *p*-bromonitrobenzene, which does not have the necessary *meta* relationship between the substituents. This makes option B an unviable route.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence begins with the Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene to produce acetophenone.\n    1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position (position 3), which is consistent with the target molecule's structure.\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** At this stage, the benzene ring has an acetyl group at position 1 and a bromo group at position 3. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director (directing to position 5), and the bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director (directing to positions 5 and 1). Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. This reinforcement of directing effects leads to the selective formation of the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis three-step sequence (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) is the most logical and effective pathway among the choices to achieve the specific 1,3,5-substitution pattern. While Friedel-Crafts reactions are generally difficult on deactivated rings, this sequence introduces the deactivating groups in an order that maintains sufficient reactivity for each subsequent step while ensuring the correct regiochemistry. The additional steps listed in option D (iv through vii) are superfluous as the target molecule is successfully synthesized in the first three steps. Their inclusion appears to be a distractor, as the initial three-step sequence is chemically sound and directly produces the target compound with high regioselectivity, which implies a high yield of the desired isomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe user has confirmed the previous analysis was correct.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nProposer: The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) at positions 1, 3, and 5, respectively. All substituents are meta to each other.\n\nA straightforward approach would be a sequence of three electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. Let's analyze the directing effects of the groups:\n*   -COCH3 (acetyl): deactivating, meta-director.\n*   -Br (bromo): deactivating, ortho/para-director.\n*   -NO2 (nitro): deactivating, meta-director.\n\nLet's propose a simple synthesis path:\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene reacts with `CH3COCl/AlCl3` to form acetophenone. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone is nitrated with `HNO3/H2SO4`. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the meta position, yielding 3-nitroacetophenone.\n3.  **Bromination:** 3-nitroacetophenone is brominated with `Br2/FeBr3`. In this molecule, both the acetyl group (at C1) and the nitro group (at C3) are meta-directors. They both direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the C5 position.\n\nThis sequence (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) should produce the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one with high regioselectivity.\n\nHowever, none of the options provided match this simple three-step synthesis. The options include steps like reduction of a nitro group (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), and deamination (`H3PO2`), suggesting a more complex route is intended, likely to circumvent a low-yield step in the simple path. The potential low-yield step in my proposed synthesis is the final bromination, as the ring is strongly deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups (-COCH3 and -NO2), which would require harsh conditions.\n\nLet's analyze the provided options to see if they present a viable, high-yield alternative.\n\nSkeptic: The proposed simple path (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is chemically sound in terms of regioselectivity, but the final bromination on a heavily deactivated ring is a valid concern for achieving high yield. The complex reaction sequences in the options suggest this is the problem to be solved. Let's critically evaluate each option.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3` (Acetophenone) → `ii) Br2/FeBr3` (3-bromoacetophenone) → `iii) HNO3/H2SO4`. In step (iii), the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone, the directing effects of the -COCH3 (meta) and -Br (ortho, para) groups are in conflict. The -COCH3 group directs to position 5, while the -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. This would lead to a mixture of products and thus a low yield of the desired isomer, making this path inefficient. The subsequent steps make no sense in the context of creating the target molecule.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) Br2/FeBr3` (Bromobenzene) → `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`. The nitration of bromobenzene yields primarily the para isomer (1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene) and some ortho isomer. The desired meta relationship is not achieved. Furthermore, step `iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3` (Friedel-Crafts acylation) would fail or have a very low yield on the strongly deactivated 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene ring. This path is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitrobenzene) → `ii) Fe/HCl` (Aniline) → `iii) NaNO2/HCl` (Diazonium salt) → `iv) H3PO2` (Benzene). This sequence of reactions simply converts benzene to aniline and then back to benzene, achieving nothing. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitrobenzene) → `ii) Fe/HCl` (Aniline) → `iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3`... This sequence is problematic from step (iii). Friedel-Crafts acylation (`CH3COCl/AlCl3`) cannot be performed on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring entirely. If this step is a typo for the protection of the amine to form acetanilide, the subsequent steps (as analyzed in the thought process) lead to 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene, not the final target which also needs an acetyl group.\n\nAll provided options appear to be flawed based on standard organic chemistry principles. There might be a typo in the question or the options. The most logical and regioselective synthesis is the simple three-step pathway I initially proposed: Acylation → Nitration → Bromination. Despite the potential for a slow final step, it is the only one that directs all substituents to the correct positions without ambiguity. If forced to choose the \"best\" sequence of reactions that *should* be listed, it is this three-step route. Since none of the options reflect this or any other valid complex pathway, there is an error in the question's premise.\n\nHowever, if we must assume there is a correct answer among the choices and re-evaluate, we must reconsider the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone (Option A, step iii). While the directing groups are conflicting, it's possible that the deactivating -COCH3 group's meta-directing effect to position 5 is dominant enough to provide a reasonable yield, making it the \"least wrong\" option among a set of flawed choices. But the subsequent steps in A (reduction, nitration again) are nonsensical.\n\nGiven the severe flaws in all options, a definitive answer cannot be reached. The question or options are likely incorrect. The most chemically sound synthesis is not listed.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in option A and the reaction sequence is only the first three steps.\ni) `CH3COCl/AlCl3` ; ii) `Br2/FeBr3` ; iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`\nThis would produce 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, but as discussed, step ii -> iii has conflicting directors.\n\nLet's reconsider the simple path: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.\n1. Benzene -> Acetophenone\n2. Acetophenone -> 3-Nitroacetophenone\n3. 3-Nitroacetophenone -> 3-Bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.\nThis path is the most logical. Let's re-examine the options to see if any can be interpreted as this path. None can.\n\nLet's step back and reconsider the initial bromination and nitration order.\nPath: Nitration -> Bromination -> Acylation\n1. Benzene -> Nitrobenzene\n2. Nitrobenzene -> 1-Bromo-3-nitrobenzene\n3. 1-Bromo-3-nitrobenzene -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\nThis path has perfect regioselectivity. The only issue is the final Friedel-Crafts acylation on a deactivated ring. This is often cited as a major limitation.\n\nComparing the two most plausible routes:\nRoute 1: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination (final step is slow)\nRoute 2: Nitration -> Bromination -> Acylation (final step is slow/fails)\n\nBetween the two, bromination on a ring with two deactivating groups (Route 1) is generally considered more feasible than Friedel-Crafts acylation on a similarly deactivated ring (Route 2). Therefore, the sequence Acylation → Nitration → Bromination is the superior theoretical pathway. Since this is not an option, and all given options contain significant chemical errors, a correct answer cannot be determined from the choices.\n\nFinal decision based on re-evaluation: All options are critically flawed. There is no correct sequence among the choices. The problem is ill-posed. However, in a multiple-choice scenario where a \"best\" fit must be found, it's impossible to logically justify any of the given sequences.\n\n<<<No correct option can be determined from the provided choices as they all contain significant chemical errors or nonsensical steps.>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
