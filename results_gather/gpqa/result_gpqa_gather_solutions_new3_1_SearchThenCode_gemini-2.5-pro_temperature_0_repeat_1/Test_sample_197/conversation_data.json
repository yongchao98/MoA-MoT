The formation of these complexes is governed by their overall stability constants (β).\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free metal ion and all the complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nUsing the stability constants, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe fraction (α₂) of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex is given by:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions for the complex concentrations, the [Co²⁺] term cancels out, leading to the following formula for the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nGiven the values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nWe can calculate each term in the denominator:\n*   1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe sum of these terms (the denominator) is:\n1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)₂] complex:\nβ₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, we calculate the fraction and convert it to a percentage:\nPercentage = (0.4 / 2.3646) × 100 ≈ 16.916%\n\nRounding to one decimal place gives 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂].\n\n**1. Identify the species in solution**\nThe total cobalt in the solution is distributed among several species due to complex formation with thiocyanate (SCN⁻). The species are:\n*   Free cobalt(II) ion: Co²⁺\n*   Monothiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   Dithiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   Trithiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   Tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n**2. Use the overall stability constants (β)**\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺], the free thiocyanate concentration [SCN⁻], and the overall stability constants (β_n).\n\nThe formation reactions and stability constants are:\nCo²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺ ;       β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\nCo²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ;     β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\nCo²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ;   β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\nCo²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\nFrom these definitions, we can write the concentration of each complex:\n[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n**3. Express the total cobalt concentration**\nSubstitute these expressions into the equation for the total cobalt concentration:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\nFactor out the [Co²⁺] term:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex**\nThe fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂], is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nSubstitute the expressions for [[Co(SCN)₂]] and c(Co):\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out, leaving an expression that depends only on the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻] and the stability constants:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**5. Plug in the given values and calculate**\nWe are given:\n[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\nβ₁ = 9\nβ₂ = 40\nβ₃ = 63\nβ₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate each term in the expression. Let's denote the denominator as Φ (the complex formation function).\n*   Numerator term: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Denominator terms:\n    *   1\n    *   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, sum the terms in the denominator:\nΦ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nNow, calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = Numerator / Φ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**6. Convert the fraction to a percentage**\nTo find the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = α₂ * 100% ≈ 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 25.6%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 16.9%\n\nThe calculated percentage matches option D. Note that the total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, was not needed for this calculation because the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻] was given directly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n\n*   We have a solution containing Cobalt(II) ions (`Co²⁺`) and thiocyanate ions (`SCN⁻`).\n*   These ions react to form a series of complexes: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`.\n*   The goal is to find the percentage of one specific complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]` (the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex), relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n\n*   Total Cobalt Concentration, `c(Co)` = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M\n*   Thiocyanate Concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   Overall Stability Constants (β):\n    *   `β₁ = 9` for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n    *   `β₂ = 40` for `[Co(SCN)₂]`\n    *   `β₃ = 63` for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n    *   `β₄ = 16` for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**3. Define the Species in Solution**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free cobalt ion and all its complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**4. Express Complex Concentrations using Stability Constants**\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the corresponding stability constant `βn`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**5. Formulate the Expression for the Total Cobalt Concentration**\n\nSubstitute the expressions from Step 4 into the equation from Step 3:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nFactor out the common term `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**6. Formulate the Expression for the Percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]`**\n\nThe percentage of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex is given by:\n`% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co) ) * 100%`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` and `c(Co)`:\n`% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)) ) * 100%`\n\n**7. Simplify the Expression**\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This is a crucial simplification.\n`% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) ) * 100%`\n\n**8. Careful Point: Ligand Concentration**\n\nThe problem states `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. We must consider if this is the *total* or *free* (equilibrium) concentration. The total cobalt concentration (0.01 M) is ten times smaller than the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M). This means the ligand is in large excess, and the amount of `SCN⁻` that binds to `Co²⁺` will be small compared to the total amount of `SCN⁻`. Therefore, we can safely approximate the free ligand concentration at equilibrium as the given concentration.\n*   **Assumption:** `[SCN⁻]` (free) ≈ 0.1 M.\n\n**9. Calculation**\n\nLet's calculate the value of the denominator first. Let `L = [SCN⁻] = 0.1`.\n*   `β₁ * L¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   `β₂ * L² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β₃ * L³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β₄ * L⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate the value of the numerator:\nNumerator = `β₂ * L² = 0.4`\n\nFinally, calculate the fraction and the percentage:\nFraction = `Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\n**10. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is approximately 16.9%. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**1. Identify all cobalt species:**\nThe species in solution are the free `Co²⁺` ion and the complexes formed with thiocyanate (`SCN⁻`):\n*   `Co²⁺`\n*   `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₂]` (the species of interest)\n*   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**2. Define the total cobalt concentration:**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**3.

Formulate the fraction of the target complex:**\nThe fraction of a specific complex, `α_n`, is its concentration divided by the total metal concentration. We are interested in `α₂` for `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions from steps 2 and 3, we get:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels from the numerator and the denominator:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**5. Perform the calculation:**\nWe are given:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M (Since the ligand concentration is 10 times the total metal concentration, we can approximate the free ligand concentration as the total ligand concentration).\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   `1`\n*   `β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nNow, sum them to get the denominator:\n`Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nThe numerator is the term for the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex:\n`Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4`\n\nCalculate the fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\n`Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis matches the result from the code execution (`16.916...%`).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to all cobalt-containing species in the solution.

This can be determined by calculating the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free Co(II) ions and all its thiocyanato complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]`\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, and the free thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN⁻]`:\n`[Co(SCN)ₙ] = βₙ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]ⁿ`\n\nThe fraction of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. The `[Co²⁺]` term will cancel out from the numerator and the denominator.\n\nThe formula for the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (α₂) is:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nMy proposed action is to substitute the given values into this formula and calculate the result. I do not need to perform a search.\n\n**Skeptic:** Your proposed formula is correct for this type of calculation. However, I have some points to consider:\n1.  The problem provides the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, which is not used in your formula. Could this value be important? It might imply that the consumption of the thiocyanate ligand by complex formation is significant, meaning the equilibrium concentration of `[SCN⁻]` is not the stated 0.1 M.\n2.  The notation `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` typically refers to the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand in the solution. If this is the case, your formula is correct, and the total cobalt concentration is extraneous information, possibly included to test understanding.\n3.  Let's assume the standard interpretation that `[SCN⁻]` is the equilibrium concentration. The calculation then depends entirely on the correct application of the formula and accurate arithmetic. A small error could lead to selecting the wrong multiple-choice option.\n\n**Decision:** The most standard and direct interpretation of the problem is that `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` is the equilibrium concentration of the free thiocyanate ligand. In this scenario, the Proposer's formula is the correct path forward. The total cobalt concentration is not needed to calculate the percentage distribution of the species. The next and final action is to perform the calculation.\n\nLet's calculate the denominator (D) of the fraction:\nD = 1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴\nD = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nD = 2.3646\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerator (N), which corresponds to the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex term:\nN = β₂ * [SCN⁻]²\nN = 40 * (0.1)²\nN = 0.4\n\nThe fraction (α₂) is N / D:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo get the percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Based on an analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This is determined by calculating the mole fraction (α₂) of this specific complex and converting it to a percentage.\n\n2.  **Define the Species and Total Concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is distributed among the free ion and its complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mole Fraction Equation:** The concentration of each complex is related to the free cobalt ion `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants (β). The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex (α₂) can be expressed by the following formula, where the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n4.  **Identify Given Values:**\n    *   Ligand Concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   Stability Constant for `[Co(SCN)]⁺}`, β₁ = 9\n    *   Stability Constant for `[Co(SCN)₂]`, β₂ = 40\n    *   Stability Constant for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, β₃ = 63\n    *   Stability Constant for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`, β₄ = 16\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The problem provides the total cobalt concentration (`c(Co) = 10⁻² M`) and the thiocyanate concentration (`[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`). Since the ligand concentration is ten times higher than the total metal concentration, the amount of `SCN⁻` consumed by complex formation is minimal. Therefore, it is a valid and standard approximation to use the given `[SCN⁻]` value as the free equilibrium concentration in the calculation. The `c(Co)` value is not needed to find the percentage distribution.\n*   **Calculation Accuracy:** The calculation involves several steps. A mistake in any step (e.g., powers of 0.1, summation) will lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **Option Matching:** The candidate answers show that while the calculation is often correct, the final letter choice is inconsistent. The final decision must be based on matching the calculated numerical result to the options provided in the original question.\n\n### Calculation\n\n1.  **Calculate the Numerator (the term for the species of interest):**\n    Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n2.  **Calculate the Denominator (the sum of terms for all species):**\n    *   Term for `Co²⁺`: 1\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mole Fraction (α₂):**\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n4.  **Convert to Percentage:**\n    Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 0.16916 × 100% = **16.916%**\n\nRounding to one decimal place gives **16.9%**. This value corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Use the overall stability constants (β)**\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺], the free thiocyanate concentration [SCN⁻], and the overall stability constants (β_n).\n\nThe formation reactions and stability constants are:\nCo²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺ ;       β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\nCo²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ;     β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\nCo²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ;   β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\nCo²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\nFrom these definitions, we can write the concentration of each complex:\n[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n**3. Express the total cobalt concentration**\nSubstitute these expressions into the equation for the total cobalt concentration:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\nFactor out the [Co²⁺] term:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex**\nThe fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂], is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nSubstitute the expressions for [[Co(SCN)₂]] and c(Co):\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out, leaving an expression that depends only on the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻] and the stability constants:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**5.

Understand the System and the Goal**\n\n*   We have a solution containing Cobalt(II) ions (`Co²⁺`) and thiocyanate ions (`SCN⁻`).\n*   These ions react to form a series of complexes: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`.\n*   The goal is to find the percentage of one specific complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]` (the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex), relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n\n*   Total Cobalt Concentration, `c(Co)` = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M\n*   Thiocyanate Concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   Overall Stability Constants (β):\n    *   `β₁ = 9` for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n    *   `β₂ = 40` for `[Co(SCN)₂]`\n    *   `β₃ = 63` for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n    *   `β₄ = 16` for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**3. Define the Species in Solution**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free cobalt ion and all its complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**4. Express Complex Concentrations using Stability Constants**\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the corresponding stability constant `βn`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**5. Formulate the Expression for the Total Cobalt Concentration**\n\nSubstitute the expressions from Step 4 into the equation from Step 3:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nFactor out the common term `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**6. Formulate the Expression for the Percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]`**\n\nThe percentage of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex is given by:\n`% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co) ) * 100%`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` and `c(Co)`:\n`% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)) ) * 100%`\n\n**7. Simplify the Expression**\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This is a crucial simplification.\n`% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) ) * 100%`\n\n**8. Careful Point: Ligand Concentration**\n\nThe problem states `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. We must consider if this is the *total* or *free* (equilibrium) concentration. The total cobalt concentration (0.01 M) is ten times smaller than the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M). This means the ligand is in large excess, and the amount of `SCN⁻` that binds to `Co²⁺` will be small compared to the total amount of `SCN⁻`. Therefore, we can safely approximate the free ligand concentration at equilibrium as the given concentration.\n*   **Assumption:** `[SCN⁻]` (free) ≈ 0.1 M.\n\n**9. Calculation**\n\nLet's calculate the value of the denominator first. Let `L = [SCN⁻] = 0.1`.\n*   `β₁ * L¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   `β₂ * L² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β₃ * L³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β₄ * L⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate the value of the numerator:\nNumerator = `β₂ * L² = 0.4`\n\nFinally, calculate the fraction and the percentage:\nFraction = `Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\n**10. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is approximately 16.9%. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**1.

Formulate the fraction of the target complex:**\nThe fraction of a specific complex, `α_n`, is its concentration divided by the total metal concentration. We are interested in `α₂` for `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions from steps 2 and 3, we get:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels from the numerator and the denominator:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**5.

The model's constraints and the resulting calculation were validated as correct. The final answer is confirmed.\n\nPlease provide the next question.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Proposer:** The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This can be determined by calculating the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free Co(II) ions and all its thiocyanato complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]`\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, and the free thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN⁻]`:\n`[Co(SCN)ₙ] = βₙ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]ⁿ`\n\nThe fraction of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. The `[Co²⁺]` term will cancel out from the numerator and the denominator.\n\nThe formula for the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (α₂) is:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nMy proposed action is to substitute the given values into this formula and calculate the result. I do not need to perform a search.\n\n**Skeptic:** Your proposed formula is correct for this type of calculation. However, I have some points to consider:\n1.  The problem provides the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, which is not used in your formula. Could this value be important? It might imply that the consumption of the thiocyanate ligand by complex formation is significant, meaning the equilibrium concentration of `[SCN⁻]` is not the stated 0.1 M.\n2.  The notation `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` typically refers to the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand in the solution. If this is the case, your formula is correct, and the total cobalt concentration is extraneous information, possibly included to test understanding.\n3.  Let's assume the standard interpretation that `[SCN⁻]` is the equilibrium concentration. The calculation then depends entirely on the correct application of the formula and accurate arithmetic. A small error could lead to selecting the wrong multiple-choice option.\n\n**Decision:** The most standard and direct interpretation of the problem is that `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` is the equilibrium concentration of the free thiocyanate ligand. In this scenario, the Proposer's formula is the correct path forward. The total cobalt concentration is not needed to calculate the percentage distribution of the species. The next and final action is to perform the calculation.\n\nLet's calculate the denominator (D) of the fraction:\nD = 1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴\nD = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nD = 2.3646\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerator (N), which corresponds to the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex term:\nN = β₂ * [SCN⁻]²\nN = 40 * (0.1)²\nN = 0.4\n\nThe fraction (α₂) is N / D:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo get the percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
