    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Part 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule as it possesses a C2 axis of symmetry.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2     H\n              \\   /\n               C=C\n              /   \\\n             H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n\n2.  **Reaction Sequence:** The reaction is a two-step process that results in anti-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. The reaction of a *trans*-alkene via *syn*-addition on its two faces (top and bottom) produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric *trans*-epoxides. In this case, it yields a racemic mixture of (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (H3O+).** This step opens the epoxide ring. The nucleophile (H₂O) attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond (a backside attack). This is an *anti*-opening of the ring.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation. The stereochemical rule for this reaction is:\n    *   **Trans-alkene + Anti-addition → Meso compound**\n\n    Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is a single compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers (in this case, (4R,5S) configuration).\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a *cis*-alkene. This molecule is also achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2     CH2CH2CH3\n              \\       /\n               C=C\n              /   \\\n             H     H\n    ```\n\n2.  **Reaction Sequence:** This is the same anti-dihydroxylation sequence as in Reaction 1.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** We apply the stereochemical rule for the anti-dihydroxylation of a *cis*-alkene:\n    *   **Cis-alkene + Anti-addition → Racemic mixture**\n\n    Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers): **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Part 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these compounds:\n*   Compound 1 is a meso compound (achiral).\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are enantiomers (chiral molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other).\n*   Compound 1 is a diastereomer of Compound 2 and Compound 3 (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Part 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This type of chromatography separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties like polarity and size.\n    *   Enantiomers (like compounds 2 and 3) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a **single peak**.\n    *   Diastereomers (like compound 1 and the pair of 2/3) have different physical properties. Therefore, they will be separated and will elute at different times.\n    *   So, the chromatogram will show one peak for the meso compound (1) and another peak for the unresolved enantiomeric pair (2 + 3).\n    *   **Total peaks on standard HPLC = 2.**\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This type of chromatography uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   Since the three compounds in the mixture are all distinct stereoisomers, they will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   The meso compound (1) will be separated from the enantiomers (2 and 3).\n    *   The enantiomers (2 and 3) will also be separated from each other.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show three distinct peaks, one for each stereoisomer.\n    *   **Total peaks on chiral HPLC = 3.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
