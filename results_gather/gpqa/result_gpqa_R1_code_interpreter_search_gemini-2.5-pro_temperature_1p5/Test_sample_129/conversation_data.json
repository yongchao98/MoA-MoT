    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I need to find the minimum redshift (`z`) that allows the Lyman-alpha spectral line to be detected by a ground-based optical telescope.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Information:**\n    *   **Spectral Line:** Lyman-alpha (Ly-α) line of neutral hydrogen.\n    *   **Rest Wavelength (`λ_emitted`):** Given as ~1216 Angstroms (Å). This is in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n    *   **Detection Method:** Ground-based optical telescopes. This is a crucial constraint.\n    *   **Goal:** Find the *lower limit* on the redshift (`z`).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Constraints:**\n    *   The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most UV radiation. This is mainly due to the ozone layer. This creates an \"atmospheric cutoff\" at a certain minimum wavelength.\n    *   For a spectral line emitted in the UV (like Ly-α at 1216 Å) to be seen from the ground, it must be redshifted enough to have its wavelength stretched past this atmospheric cutoff.\n    *   The redshift `z` is related to the emitted wavelength (`λ_emitted`) and the observed wavelength (`λ_observed`) by the formula:\n        `λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + z)`\n\n4.  **Determine the Cutoff Wavelength:**\n    *   I need to know the shortest wavelength (`λ_observed`) that can penetrate the atmosphere and be detected by a standard optical telescope.\n    *   The absolute physical cutoff is around 3200 Å (320 nanometers). Below this, the atmosphere is essentially opaque.\n    *   However, for practical astronomical observations, especially spectroscopy of faint objects like quasars, astronomers need good atmospheric transmission and detector sensitivity. The atmosphere's transparency improves significantly as you move to longer wavelengths. Therefore, the *practical* start of the ground-based optical window is often considered to be the beginning of the visible spectrum, which is around 4000 Å (400 nm).\n    *   Let's use this more practical value, as \"detection\" implies a measurement with reasonable signal quality. So, let's set the minimum required `λ_observed` to be approximately 4000 Å.\n\n5.  **Set up the Calculation:**\n    *   I need to find the redshift `z` that shifts the 1216 Å line to 4000 Å.\n    *   `λ_emitted = 1216 Å`\n    *   `λ_observed = 4000 Å`\n    *   Using the formula: `4000 = 1216 * (1 + z)`\n\n6.  **Solve for `z`:**\n    *   First, I'll rearrange the formula to solve for `z`:\n        `(1 + z) = λ_observed / λ_emitted`\n        `z = (λ_observed / λ_emitted) - 1`\n    *   Now, I will plug in the values and compute the result using a python script.\n\n```python\n# The rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line in Angstroms.\nlambda_emitted = 1216\n\n# The approximate shortest wavelength observable from the ground for practical purposes\n# (start of the visible spectrum). This is the minimum observed wavelength.\nlambda_observed_min = 4000\n\n# Calculate the redshift z using the formula: z = (lambda_observed / lambda_emitted) - 1\nredshift_z = (lambda_observed_min / lambda_emitted) - 1\n\nprint(redshift_z)\n```\n\n7.  **Interpret the Result:**\n    *   The calculation gives a redshift of approximately `z ≈ 2.29`.\n    *   Now I compare this result to the given multiple-choice options:\n        A) 2.4\n        B) 1.2\n        C) 3\n        D) 1.9\n    *   The calculated value `z ≈ 2.29` is closest to option A, which is 2.4. The small difference is likely due to using an approximate value for the cutoff wavelength (e.g., the actual practical limit considered for this problem might be closer to 4100 Å). A redshift of 2.4 would shift the line to `1216 * (1 + 2.4) = 4134 Å`, which is well within the standard optical window. A redshift of 1.9 would shift it to `1216 * (1 + 1.9) = 3526 Å`, which is in the near-UV and much more difficult to observe from the ground due to lower atmospheric transmission. Therefore, 2.4 is the most reasonable lower limit for practical detection.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift of an object so that its Lyman-alpha emission line can be detected by a ground-based optical telescope.\n\n1.  **Identify the emitted wavelength:** The Lyman-alpha (Ly-α) line of neutral hydrogen has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength is in the far ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Identify the observational constraint:** Ground-based optical telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere is opaque to most ultraviolet radiation, particularly wavelengths shorter than about 3200 Å. For practical spectroscopic observations, which require good atmospheric transparency, the effective cutoff is typically considered to be the beginning of the visible spectrum, around 4000 Å. This is the minimum observed wavelength (`λ_observed`) that can be reliably detected.\n\n3.  **Use the redshift formula:** The redshift `z` relates the emitted wavelength (`λ_emitted`) to the observed wavelength (`λ_observed`) by the formula:\n    `λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + z)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the minimum redshift:** To find the lower limit on the redshift, we need to calculate the `z` value that shifts the 1216 Å line to the minimum observable wavelength from the ground. We will use `λ_observed_min` ≈ 4000 Å.\n\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for `z`:\n    `z = (λ_observed / λ_emitted) - 1`\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    `z = (4000 Å / 1216 Å) - 1`\n    `z ≈ 3.289 - 1`\n    `z ≈ 2.29`\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) 2.4\n    B) 1.2\n    C) 3\n    D) 1.9\n\n    The calculated value `z ≈ 2.29` is closest to option A) 2.4. A redshift of 2.4 would shift the Ly-α line to `1216 Å * (1 + 2.4) = 4134.4 Å`, which is well within the observable optical window for ground-based telescopes. The other options are either too low (1.2, 1.9), which would leave the line in the difficult-to-observe near-UV, or significantly higher than the calculated lower limit. Therefore, `z = 2.4` represents a realistic and practical lower limit for such observations.\n\n<<<A>>>"
