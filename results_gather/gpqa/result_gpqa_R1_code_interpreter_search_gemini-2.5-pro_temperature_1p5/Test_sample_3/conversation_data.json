    "*   **Step 1: Understand the core concept.** The question is about magnetic monopoles. In our universe, magnets always have a North and a South pole together (they are dipoles). An \"isolated North or South pole\" is a hypothetical particle called a magnetic monopole. The question asks how Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism would change if these monopoles existed.\n\n*   **Step 2: Review Maxwell's Equations (in differential form) and their physical meaning.**\n    1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇ ⋅ E = ρ / ε₀**\n        *   This says the divergence (how much a field spreads out from a point) of the electric field (E) is proportional to the electric charge density (ρ). In simple terms: electric field lines start and end on electric charges.\n    2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇ ⋅ B = 0**\n        *   This says the divergence of the magnetic field (B) is zero. In simple terms: there are no magnetic \"charges\" (monopoles) for magnetic field lines to start or end on. Magnetic field lines always form closed loops.\n    3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction: ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t**\n        *   This says the curl (circulation) of the electric field is caused by a changing magnetic field.\n    4.  **Ampère-Maxwell Law: ∇ × B = μ₀(J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t)**\n        *   This says the curl (circulation) of the magnetic field is caused by an electric current (J) and a changing electric field.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the effect of magnetic monopoles on each equation.**\n    *   **Effect on Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∇ ⋅ B = 0):** This is the most direct and obvious change. If magnetic monopoles (let's call their density ρ_m) existed, they would act as sources and sinks for the magnetic field, just like electric charges do for the electric field. The equation would no longer be zero on the right-hand side. It would become analogous to Gauss's Law for Electricity: **∇ ⋅ B = μ₀ρ_m**. Thus, the equation for the **divergence of the magnetic field** would be different.\n\n    *   **Effect on Faraday's Law (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t):** This requires thinking about symmetry. Maxwell's equations are beautiful in their symmetry between electric and magnetic fields, with one exception: the existence of electric charges but not magnetic ones. If magnetic charges (monopoles) exist, it is natural to assume that a flow of these charges—a magnetic current (let's call it J_m)—could also exist. In the symmetric Ampère-Maxwell law, an electric current (J) creates a curling magnetic field. By symmetry, a magnetic current (J_m) should create a curling electric field. This would add a new term to Faraday's Law: **∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀J_m**. Thus, the equation for the **circulation of the electric field** would also be different.\n\n    *   **Effect on the other two equations:**\n        *   Gauss's Law for Electricity deals with electric charges, so it would remain unchanged.\n        *   The Ampère-Maxwell Law deals with the sources of a curling magnetic field (electric currents and changing electric fields). The existence of magnetic monopoles doesn't change this relationship.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude and select the correct option.**\n    The two equations that would be modified by the existence of magnetic monopoles (and their currents) are:\n    1.  Gauss's Law for Magnetism (related to the **divergence of the magnetic field**).\n    2.  Faraday's Law of Induction (related to the **circulation of the electric field**).\n\n    This corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
