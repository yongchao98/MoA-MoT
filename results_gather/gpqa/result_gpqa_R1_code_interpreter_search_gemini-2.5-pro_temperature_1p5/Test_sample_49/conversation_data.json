    "This is a problem about interpreting the structure of an expression from quantum field theory (QFT). The number of loops in a Feynman diagram can be determined from the powers of certain fundamental constants that appear in the expression for the diagram's amplitude.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Loop Factor:** In calculations involving loop diagrams in QFT, particularly when using dimensional regularization in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop integral contributes a factor of `1/(4π)^2` to the overall expression. This factor arises from the surface area of a unit sphere in the dimension of the loop momentum integral after Wick rotation.\n2.  **General Formula:** For a diagram with `L` loops, the total factor from the loop integrations will be `(1/(4π)^2)^L = 1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n3.  **Analyze the Given Expression:** The expression provided is:\n    `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n    The crucial term for determining the number of loops is `1/(4pi)^6`.\n4.  **Equate and Solve:** We can set our general formula equal to the term found in the expression:\n    `1/(4π)^(2L) = 1/(4pi)^6`\n    This implies that the exponents must be equal:\n    `2L = 6`\n    Solving for `L`, we get:\n    `L = 3`\n5.  **Conclusion:** The diagram must have contained 3 loops.\n\nThe other terms in the expression provide additional context but are not needed to find the loop number. `alpha^3` and `g^2` are coupling constants, indicating there are 5 vertices in the diagram. `(Q/M)^2` is a ratio of energy scales that typically appears after evaluating the loop integrals. The numerical factors `sqrt(2)` and `8` are symmetry factors or other constants specific to this particular diagram. The factor of `1/(4pi)^6`, however, is a direct consequence of performing three separate loop integrations.\n\n<<<A>>>"
