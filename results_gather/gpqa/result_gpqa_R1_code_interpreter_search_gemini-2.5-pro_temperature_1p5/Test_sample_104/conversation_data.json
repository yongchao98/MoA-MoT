    "This problem requires us to compare the photometric signal produced by stellar spots with that of a transiting exoplanet. We need to find the relative radius of an exoplanet ($R_{pl}/R_{star}$) that would cause the same brightness dip as the rotational modulation of the spotted star.\n\n**1. Understand the source of brightness variation:**\nThe star has one hemisphere covered in spots and the other is clean. As the star rotates, an observer sees a periodic change in brightness.\n*   **Maximum Brightness ($F_{max}$):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is fully facing the observer.\n*   **Minimum Brightness ($F_{min}$):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is fully facing the observer.\n\nThe amplitude of this variation is given by $\\frac{F_{max} - F_{min}}{F_{max}}$.\n\n**2. Formulate the flux expressions:**\nAccording to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the energy radiated per unit area of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature ($F \\propto T^4$). The total flux received by an observer is the integral of this quantity over the star's visible disk.\n\n*   Let's consider the projected area of the star's disk, $A_{disk} = \\pi R_{star}^2$.\n*   For the unspotted hemisphere (maximum brightness), the entire disk radiates at the star's effective temperature, $T_{star} = 6000$ K.\n    $F_{max} \\propto A_{disk} \\cdot T_{star}^4$\n*   For the spotted hemisphere (minimum brightness), a fraction $f=0.2$ of the disk area is covered by spots at temperature $T_{spot} = 6000 - 1000 = 5000$ K. The remaining area $(1-f)=0.8$ is at $T_{star}$.\n    $F_{min} \\propto (1-f) \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{star}^4 + f \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{spot}^4$\n\n**3. Calculate the amplitude of the spot-induced variation:**\nThe relative amplitude of the signal is:\nAmplitude = $\\frac{F_{max} - F_{min}}{F_{max}} = \\frac{A_{disk} T_{star}^4 - [ (1-f) A_{disk} T_{star}^4 + f A_{disk} T_{spot}^4 ]}{A_{disk} T_{star}^4}$\n\nWe can cancel out the common term $A_{disk}$:\nAmplitude = $\\frac{T_{star}^4 - (1-f) T_{star}^4 - f T_{spot}^4}{T_{star}^4} = \\frac{f T_{star}^4 - f T_{spot}^4}{T_{star}^4}$\nAmplitude = $f \\left( 1 - \\frac{T_{spot}^4}{T_{star}^4} \\right) = f \\left( 1 - \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{star}}\\right)^4 \\right)$\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   $f = 0.20$\n*   $T_{star} = 6000$ K\n*   $T_{spot} = 5000$ K\n\nAmplitude = $0.20 \\times \\left( 1 - \\left(\\frac{5000}{6000}\\right)^4 \\right) = 0.20 \\times \\left( 1 - \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^4 \\right)$\n\n**4. Relate the amplitude to an exoplanet transit:**\nThe dimming caused by a transiting exoplanet (the transit depth) is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area:\nTransit Depth = $\\frac{\\pi R_{pl}^2}{\\pi R_{star}^2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2$\n\nWe are looking for the case where the transit depth equals the amplitude of the spot signal.\n$\\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2$ = Amplitude\n\n**5. Calculate the final value:**\nWe can use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nf = 0.20  # Spot filling factor\nT_star = 6000.0  # Star's effective temperature in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000.0  # Spot temperature in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)**4)\namplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)**4)\n\n# The transit depth of an exoplanet is (R_pl / R_star)**2\n# We set the transit depth equal to the spot variation amplitude\n# (R_pl / R_star)**2 = amplitude\n# So, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude)\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(f\"The amplitude of the spot-induced variation is: {amplitude:.5f}\")\nprint(f\"The required relative radius of the exoplanet (Rpl/Rstar) is: {relative_radius:.5f}\")\n```\nThe amplitude of the spot-induced variation is: 0.10355\nThe required relative radius of the exoplanet (Rpl/Rstar) is: 0.32179\n\nThe calculated relative radius is approximately 0.322. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe value is closest to 0.32.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks us to calculate the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet ($R_{pl}/R_{star}$) that would produce a light curve dip of the same amplitude as the one caused by rotational modulation of a spotted star.\n\n**Step 1: Define the system and the source of brightness variation.**\n\n*   The star has a constant effective temperature, $T_{star} = 6000$ K.\n*   One hemisphere is partially covered by dark spots. The filling factor of these spots is $f = 20\\% = 0.20$.\n*   The spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere by 1000 K, so their temperature is $T_{spot} = 6000 \\text{ K} - 1000 \\text{ K} = 5000$ K.\n*   The star's rotation causes an observer to see different faces of the star over time.
