    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\nThis reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to form an alpha-bromo ketone. Due to the symmetry of cyclohexanone, bromination occurs at either of the equivalent alpha-carbons (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\nThis reaction involves an alpha-halo ketone with a strong base, which are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. The mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1.  A hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes a proton from the other alpha-carbon (C6), which is the one not bearing the bromine atom, to form an enolate.\n2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion. This forms a strained bicyclic intermediate containing a cyclopropane ring, which is a derivative of cyclopropanone (specifically, bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the cyclopropanone intermediate.\n4.  The strained ring opens up to relieve ring strain, leading to a ring contraction. The cleavage occurs to form the more stable carbanion, which is then protonated. For a 2-halocyclohexanone, this process results in the formation of a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group.\n\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride). Thionyl chloride is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n\nThis is a reduction reaction. LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is a bulky, mild reducing agent. Unlike the powerful LiAlH₄ which would reduce the acyl chloride all the way to an alcohol, LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is selective and stops the reduction at the aldehyde stage. This is a common and specific transformation.\n\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nThe final task is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to determining the number of signals expected in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure is a five-membered ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nTo determine the chemical equivalence of the hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational changes (pseudorotation). The time-averaged conformation possesses a plane of symmetry (it belongs to the Cₛ point group). This plane passes through:\n*   The aldehyde group (CHO).\n*   The carbon it is attached to (C1) and the hydrogen on that carbon.\n*   It bisects the bond between C3 and C4.\n\nThis plane of symmetry has the following consequences for the equivalence of atoms:\n*   Carbon C2 is equivalent to carbon C5.\n*   Carbon C3 is equivalent to carbon C4.\n\nNow, let's count the sets of chemically distinct (non-equivalent) hydrogen atoms:\n\n1.  **The aldehydic hydrogen (-CHO):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The hydrogen on C1:** This hydrogen is on the plane of symmetry and is also in a unique environment, being attached to the carbon bonded to the aldehyde. (1 type)\n3.  **The hydrogens on C2 and C5:** C2 and C5 are equivalent. Each of these carbons has two hydrogens. Since C1 is a stereocenter (even in an achiral molecule, it creates a diastereotopic relationship for adjacent protons), the two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. The same applies to C5. By symmetry, the two non-equivalent hydrogens on C2 correspond to the two on C5. Thus, there are two distinct types of hydrogens on these carbons. (2 types)\n4.  **The hydrogens on C3 and C4:** C3 and C4 are equivalent. Similar to the case for C2/C5, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. They are equivalent to their corresponding partners on C4. This gives another two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming up the different types of hydrogen atoms:\n1 (aldehyde) + 1 (on C1) + 2 (on C2/C5) + 2 (on C3/C4) = 6\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<D>>>"
