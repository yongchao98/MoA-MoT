    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Identify the Species:** In the solution, cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes. The total cobalt concentration, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its thiocyanato complexes:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]\n\n3.  **Use Stability Constants:** The concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of the free Co²⁺ concentration, the free SCN⁻ concentration, and the overall stability constants (βₙ):\n    *   β₁ = [Co(SCN)⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻])  =>  [Co(SCN)⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n    *   β₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) =>  [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n    *   β₃ = [Co(SCN)₃⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) =>  [Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n    *   β₄ = [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) =>  [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n4.  **Formulate the Fraction:** The percentage of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100. Let's first find the fraction, denoted as α₂:\n    α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)\n\n5.  **Substitute and Simplify:** Substitute the expressions from steps 2 and 3 into the fraction formula:\n    α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    The [Co²⁺] term is common to all terms in the numerator and denominator, so it can be cancelled out:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n6.  **Approximate the Ligand Concentration:** The total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is significantly larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M). This means that the amount of SCN⁻ that binds to cobalt is small compared to the total amount of SCN⁻ available. Therefore, we can approximate the free SCN⁻ concentration to be equal to its total concentration:\n    [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M\n\n7.  **Calculate the Values:** Now, substitute the given numerical values into the simplified formula for α₂.\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n    First, calculate the terms in the denominator:\n    *   Term 0: 1\n    *   Term 1: β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   Term 2: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   Term 3: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   Term 4: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\n    Now, sum these terms to get the denominator:\n    Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n    The numerator is the term corresponding to [Co(SCN)₂]:\n    Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Calculate the fraction α₂ and convert it to a percentage.\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    Percentage = α₂ * 100 ≈ 16.916%\n\n    This value is very close to 16.9%.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's use a Python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the given stability constants and ligand concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nligand_conc = 0.1  # [SCN-]\n\n# The term in the distribution formula for the desired complex, [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator_term = beta2 * (ligand_conc ** 2)\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms, from the free metal ion (beta0 = 1) to the final complex\ndenominator_sum = 1 + \\\n                  beta1 * (ligand_conc ** 1) + \\\n                  beta2 * (ligand_conc ** 2) + \\\n                  beta3 * (ligand_conc ** 3) + \\\n                  beta4 * (ligand_conc ** 4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nfraction_alpha2 = numerator_term / denominator_sum\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = fraction_alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage=}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
