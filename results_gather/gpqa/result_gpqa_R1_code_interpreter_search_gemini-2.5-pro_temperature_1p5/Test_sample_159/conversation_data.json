    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Geometry of the Aperture**\n\n*   The aperture is a regular N-sided polygon.\n*   A key characteristic given is that all apothems have the same length, 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of a side.\n*   The problem asks for the case where N becomes infinitely large (N → ∞).\n*   As N approaches infinity, a regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' will geometrically approach a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle.\n\n**2. Identify the Physical Phenomenon**\n\n*   A monochromatic light wave of wavelength λ passes through this aperture and forms a pattern in the far-field region.\n*   This is a classic example of Fraunhofer diffraction.\n*   Since the aperture for N → ∞ is a circle of radius 'a', the problem reduces to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from a circular aperture.\n\n**3. Recall the Theory of Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture**\n\n*   The intensity distribution of the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity I at an angle θ from the central axis is given by:\n    I(θ) = I₀ [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²\n    where:\n    *   I₀ is the central maximum intensity.\n    *   J₁(x) is the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one.\n    *   'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   k is the wave number, defined as k = 2π/λ.\n    *   θ is the angular position from the center.\n\n**4. Determine the Positions of the Minima**\n\n*   The intensity minima (dark rings in the pattern) occur when the numerator of the intensity formula is zero, which means J₁(k * a * sinθ) = 0.\n*   We need to find the roots (or zeros) of the Bessel function J₁(x). Let these zeros be denoted by z₁, z₂, z₃, ...\n*   The first few non-trivial zeros of J₁(x) are approximately:\n    *   z₁ ≈ 3.8317\n    *   z₂ ≈ 7.0156\n    *   z₃ ≈ 10.1735\n*   The condition for the n-th minimum at an angle θₙ is:\n    k * a * sin(θₙ) = zₙ\n*   Substituting k = 2π/λ and using the small-angle approximation (sinθ ≈ θ) as specified in the problem:\n    (2π/λ) * a * θₙ = zₙ\n*   Solving for the angular position θₙ:\n    θₙ = (zₙ * λ) / (2π * a)\n\n**5. Calculate the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima**\n\n*   **First Minimum (n=1):** The angular position θ₁ is determined by the first zero, z₁.\n    θ₁ = (z₁ * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ/a)\n\n*   **Second Minimum (n=2):** The angular position θ₂ is determined by the second zero, z₂.\n    θ₂ = (z₂ * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ/a)\n\n**6. Calculate the Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima\", which is the difference between their angular positions: Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n*   Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(z₂ * λ) / (2π * a)] - [(z₁ * λ) / (2π * a)]\n*   Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) * λ / (2π * a)\n*   Substituting the values of the zeros:\n    Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π * a)\n    Δθ = 3.1839 * λ / (2π * a)\n*   Now, we calculate the numerical coefficient:\n    Coefficient = 3.1839 / (2π) ≈ 3.1839 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.5067\n*   Therefore, the angular distance is:\n    Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ/a)\n\n**7. Compare with the Given Options**\n\n*   A) 1.220 λ/a\n*   B) 0.500 λ/a\n*   C) 0.610 λ/a\n*   D) 0.506 λ/a\n\nOur calculated value of approximately 0.507 λ/a is closest to option D.\n\n(Note: Option C, 0.610 λ/a, corresponds to the angular position of the *first* minimum, θ₁, not the distance between the first and second minima. Option A, 1.220 λ/a, is related to the Rayleigh criterion for a circular aperture of diameter 'a', not radius 'a').\n\nFinal Answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
