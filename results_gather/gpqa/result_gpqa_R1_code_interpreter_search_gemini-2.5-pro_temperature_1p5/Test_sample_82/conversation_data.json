    "This problem requires calculating the pH at two specific points during the titration of a diluted weak acid with a strong base.\n\n**1. Understand the initial conditions and dilution:**\n*   We start with 20.00 cm³ (0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   The number of moles of acetic acid is: Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.020 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   This solution is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   The total volume of the acid solution before titration is 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L).\n*   The new concentration of the diluted acetic acid is: [CH₃COOH] = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M.\n\n**2. Titration Reaction:**\nThe reaction between acetic acid (a weak acid, HA) and sodium hydroxide (a strong base, NaOH) is:\nCH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\nThis is a 1:1 molar reaction.\n\n**3. pH at 25% Titration:**\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, forming its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This means 75% of the acetic acid remains.\n*   We now have a buffer solution containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to find the pH of a buffer:\n    pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[weak acid])\n    pH = pKa + log([CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of [CH₃COO⁻] to [CH₃COOH] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   Now, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - log(3)\n    pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.48 = 4.25\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is 4.26.\n\n**4. pH at the Equivalence Point:**\n*   The equivalence point is reached when the moles of NaOH added are equal to the initial moles of CH₃COOH.\n    Moles NaOH = Moles CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n*   Calculate the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed:\n    Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   The total volume of the solution is the initial volume of the diluted acid plus the volume of NaOH added:\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   The concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point is:\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water:\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   To find the pH, we first need to find the concentration of OH⁻. We use the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka, where Kw (the ion product of water) is 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C.\n    Kb = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n*   Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH]. The equation becomes:\n    5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    x² ≈ (5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.082 × 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.082 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Now, calculate the pOH:\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n*   Finally, calculate the pH:\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   The pH at 25% titration is 4.26.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\nThese values match option A.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nKa_acetic_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# Initial conditions\ninitial_vol_acid = 0.020  # L\ninitial_conc_acid = 0.05   # M\nvol_water = 0.020        # L\nconc_naoh = 0.1          # M\n\n# 1.

    "**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n**1. Initial State and Dilution**\n\n*   First, we calculate the initial number of moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) before dilution.\n    *   Volume of acid = 20.00 cm³ = 0.020 L\n    *   Concentration of acid = 0.05 M\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.020 L = 0.001 mol\n\n*   Next, the acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. We calculate the new concentration of the acid.\n    *   Initial volume of acid = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Total volume of the diluted solution = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L\n    *   New concentration of CH₃COOH = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M\n\n**2. Titration Reaction**\n\nThe chemical reaction between acetic acid (a weak acid) and sodium hydroxide (a strong base) is:\nCH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n\n**3. pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This means 75% of the original acetic acid remains.\n*   This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n    pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[weak acid])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   Ka = 1.85 × 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base to the weak acid is:\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n*   Now, we substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - log(3)\n    *   pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, **pH = 4.26**\n\n**4. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   The equivalence point is reached when the moles of NaOH added are equal to the initial moles of CH₃COOH.\n    *   Moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 mol\n*   Calculate the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point:\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution now contains only CH₃COO⁻ ions, which act as a weak base.\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) at the equivalence point:\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, producing OH⁻ ions:\n    *   CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   To find the pH, we first need to find the pOH. We must calculate the Kb for the acetate ion:\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Now, we set up an equilibrium expression to find the concentration of OH⁻:\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻]. Then 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = (5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.082 × 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Calculate the pOH:\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n*   Finally, calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n    *   The **pH at the equivalence point is 8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH = 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<A>>>"
