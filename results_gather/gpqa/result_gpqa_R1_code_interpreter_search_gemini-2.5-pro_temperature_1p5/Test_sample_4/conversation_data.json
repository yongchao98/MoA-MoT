    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the Operators**: The problem provides the components of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon. These are given in terms of the Pauli matrices $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$.\n    *   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n    *   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n    *   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n    This operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S}$ for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon, as $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$.\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector**: The problem asks for the eigenvector of the operator along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane. A general unit vector $\\vec{n}$ in spherical coordinates is given by $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle (angle with the z-axis) and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle (angle with the x-axis in the x-y plane).\n    Since $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. This means we can set the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$. The direction vector $\\vec{n}$ becomes:\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator along $\\vec{n}$**: The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y (0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_z \\cos\\theta$\n    Substituting the matrices for $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_z$:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation**: We need to find the eigenvector $|\\chi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\chi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\chi\\rangle$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    We can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve the System of Equations**: This matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations for the components $a$ and $b$:\n    (1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    (2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    From equation (1), we can rearrange to find the ratio $b/a$:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\n    Using the trigonometric half-angle identities $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    So, $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. This defines the relationship between the components of the eigenvector.\n\n6.  **Determine the Eigenvector and Normalize it**: The eigenvector is of the form $|\\chi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. To find the value of $a$, we normalize the eigenvector, meaning the sum of the squares of the moduli of its components must be 1.\n    $|a|^2 (1^2 + |\\tan(\\theta/2)|^2) = 1$\n    $|a|^2 (1 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n    Using the identity $1 + \\tan^2(x) = \\sec^2(x)$:\n    $|a|^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n    $|a|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sec^2(\\theta/2)} = \\cos^2(\\theta/2)$\n    Choosing $a$ to be real and positive for simplicity, we get $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$.\n\n    Now, we find $b$:\n    $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n\n    So, the normalized eigenvector is:\n    $|\\chi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options**:\n    A) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar) - Incorrect. Eigenvector components should be dimensionless.\n    B) (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2)) - This matches our result.\n    C) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta)) - Incorrect. The dependence is on $\\theta/2$, not $\\theta$.\n    D) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Incorrect due to the factor of $\\hbar$ and the numerical coefficients.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. We can verify this result using python.\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define theta as a symbol\ntheta = sp.Symbol('theta', real=True)\n\n# Define the matrix operator P_n / (hbar/2)\n# This matrix should have an eigenvalue of +1 for the given eigenvector\nPn_scaled = sp.Matrix([\n    [sp.cos(theta), sp.sin(theta)],\n    [sp.sin(theta), -sp.cos(theta)]\n])\n\n# Define the proposed eigenvector from option B\neigenvector_B = sp.Matrix([\n    [sp.cos(theta/2)],\n    [sp.sin(theta/2)]\n])\n\n# Calculate the action of the operator on the eigenvector\nresult = Pn_scaled * eigenvector_B\n\n# Simplify the result using trigonometric identities\nresult_simplified = sp.simplify(result)\n\n# Check if the result is equal to 1 * eigenvector_B\n# This confirms that eigenvector_B is an eigenvector with eigenvalue +1\nis_eigenvector = result_simplified == eigenvector_B\n\n# Check if the eigenvector is normalized.
