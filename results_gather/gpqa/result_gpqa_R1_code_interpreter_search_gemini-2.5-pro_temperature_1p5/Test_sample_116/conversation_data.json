    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups). However, chirality can also arise from other structural features like axial chirality (in atropisomers) or planar chirality.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls consist of two phenyl rings linked by a single C-C bond. In this specific molecule, the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky substituents: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The bulky groups at the ortho positions sterically hinder the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation is a phenomenon known as atropisomerism. Because of this hindrance, the two phenyl rings cannot lie in the same plane. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making it chiral. It exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, this compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its chemical formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon atoms to find a chiral center. The second carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since C2 is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and exists as two enantiomers (R and S forms). Therefore, this compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** Also known as diphenylmethanone, its structure is C6H5-CO-C6H5. A central carbonyl group is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is symmetric. It has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule. There are no chiral centers. The molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This molecule is planar. It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. (Note: It does have a geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate, but this is a different type of isomerism).\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    Based on the analysis, compound 1 (due to atropisomerism) and compound 2 (due to a chiral center) exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\n    Therefore, the correct choice includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
