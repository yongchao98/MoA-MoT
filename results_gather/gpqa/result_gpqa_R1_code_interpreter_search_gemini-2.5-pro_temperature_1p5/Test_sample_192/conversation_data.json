    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks how the number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) depends on the distance (`r`).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:** We are told that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵\". In physics and astronomy, this phrasing typically describes a distribution function or a differential count. Therefore, we interpret this statement as the number of stars per unit parallax, `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx⁵`.\n    Mathematically, this can be written as:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n3.  **Establish the Relationship between Distance and Parallax:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to distance (`r`). For standard astronomical units (distance in parsecs, parallax in arcseconds), the relationship is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Connect the Rates of Change using the Chain Rule:** We want to find `dN/dr`, and we know `dN/d(plx)`. The chain rule of calculus connects these two derivatives:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative of Parallax with Respect to Distance:** We need to find `d(plx)/dr` from the relationship `plx = 1/r`.\n    `plx = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Chain Rule Equation:** Now we substitute the expressions for `dN/d(plx)` and `d(plx)/dr` into the chain rule formula. We are interested in the proportional scaling, so we can ignore constants and the negative sign (which just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases).\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance (r):** The current expression has both `plx` and `r`. To get the final answer, we must express everything in terms of `r`. We use the relationship `plx = 1/r`.\n    Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the term `plx⁻⁵`:\n    `plx⁻⁵ = (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute this back into our expression for `dN/dr`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁵⁻²`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n**Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of distance scales as the cube of the distance, `r³`. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
