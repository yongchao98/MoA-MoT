    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2.**\n\nThe problem states that compound A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let's assume A2 has the formula YF_n, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n\nWhere:\n*   M_F is the atomic mass of Fluorine (≈ 19.00 g/mol).\n*   M_Y is the atomic mass of element Y.\n*   n is an integer.\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for M_Y:\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + n * 19.00)\n0.3196 * M_Y + 0.3196 * (n * 19.00) = n * 19.00\n0.3196 * M_Y = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n0.3196 * M_Y = n * 19.00 * 0.6804\nM_Y = n * (12.9276 / 0.3196)\nM_Y ≈ n * 40.45\n\nNow we test integer values for n to find a plausible element Y with atomic mass M_Y:\n*   n = 1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Calcium, Ca). Unlikely to form the described compounds.\n*   n = 2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Bromine, Br). Chemistry doesn't fit well.\n*   n = 3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, M ≈ 121.76 g/mol).\n*   n = 4: M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is very close to Dysprosium (Dy, M ≈ 162.5 g/mol).\n*   n = 5: M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol. (e.g., Gold, Au, M=197).\n*   n = 6: M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to Plutonium (Pu, M=244 g/mol).\n\nLet's check the mass percentages for the best candidates precisely:\n*   **Y=Sb, n=3 (A2=SbF₃)**: M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3*19.00 = 178.76. ɷF = (57/178.76) * 100% = **31.88%**. (Excellent match)\n*   **Y=Dy, n=4 (A2=DyF₄)**: M(DyF₄) = 162.5 + 4*19.00 = 238.5. ɷF = (76/238.5) * 100% = **31.86%**. (Excellent match)\n*   **Y=Pu, n=6 (A2=PuF₆)**: M(PuF₆) = 244 + 6*19.00 = 358. ɷF = (114/358) * 100% = **31.84%**. (Excellent match)\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the chemical plausibility of each candidate.**\n\nWe must now use the other chemical clues to decide between Sb, Dy, and Pu.\n\n*   **Pu Hypothesis**: While the mass percentage for PuF₆ is a good fit for A2, other clues create contradictions. For instance, A1 decomposes to A2 and fluorine. The only known decomposition of this type is PuF₆ → PuF₄ + F₂. This would imply A1=PuF₆ and A2=PuF₄. But we identified A2 as PuF₆ from the mass percent. This is a fatal contradiction.\n\n*   **Sb Hypothesis**: Antimony chemistry is very rich with fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅, and various mixed-valence compounds like SbF₄, Sb₂F₇), fitting the \"five binary compounds\" clue. Many of the qualitative clues fit if one assumes errors in the problem statement (a common trait of olympiad-style problems). For example, A3, which reacts with Xe, is likely SbF₅. A1 decomposing to A2(SbF₃) would imply A1=SbF₅, but the properties don't match and it creates an identity clash with A3. If we proceed by identifying A4, the most plausible candidate is SbF₅ (as it's a liquid and can be a \"concentrated solution\"). Its molecular weight is 216.76 g/mol. This value does not fall into any of the given ranges, although it is very close to range A [220-240]. This discrepancy suggests this might not be the intended answer.\n\n*   **Dy Hypothesis**: Let's test the Dysprosium case, which also had an excellent mass percentage match.\n    *   Y = Dy, **A2 = DyF₄**.\n    *   \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine\". This implies A1 → DyF₄ + F₂, which means **A1 = DyF₆**. DyF₆ is not a stable, known compound, but may be assumed to exist for the problem.\n    *   \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\" This suggests A3 is a strong oxidizer, like DyF₆ or possibly DyF₄.\n    *   \"A5 is obtained by adding Y (Dy) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". This is a comproportionation reaction: `Dy(0) + A4 -> A5`. This means A4 must have a higher oxidation state than A5.\n    *   \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances\". Let's test the hydrolysis of dysprosium fluorides. `DyF₃ + 3H₂O → Dy(OH)₃↓ + 3HF`. This produces two substances, a solid precipitate and an aqueous acid. So, a plausible candidate for **A5 is DyF₃**.\n    *   Now, let's identify A4 from the reaction: `Dy + A4 → A5(DyF₃)`. To produce Dy(III)F₃ from Dy(0), A4 must be a fluoride with an oxidation state higher than +3. The logical choice is **A4 = DyF₄**. The balanced reaction is `Dy + 3DyF₄ → 4DyF₃`. The 1:1 ratio given in the problem is inconsistent, which is a common issue in such problems.\n    *   This hypothesis provides a full (though not perfectly consistent) set of assignments for the compounds. Crucially, it identifies A4.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight of A4 and select the correct range.**\n\nBased on the Dysprosium hypothesis, **A4 is DyF₄**.\nLet's calculate its molecular weight:\nM(DyF₄) = M(Dy) + 4 * M(F)\nM(DyF₄) = 162.5 g/mol + 4 * 19.00 g/mol\nM(DyF₄) = 162.5 + 76.0\nM(DyF₄) = **238.5 g/mol**\n\nNow, we check which of the given ranges contains this value:\nA) 220-240\nB) 140-160\nC) 110-130\nD) 160-180\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 238.5 g/mol falls squarely within the range **220-240**. While the Dysprosium chemistry is exotic, it provides a numerically perfect answer, which is often the intended solution path when the problem text contains inconsistencies.\n\n<<<A>>>"
