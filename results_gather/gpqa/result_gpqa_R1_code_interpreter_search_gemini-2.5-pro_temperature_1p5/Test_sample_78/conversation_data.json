    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product's Structure from the Provided NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectra for the product of the reaction. We must first deduce the structure of this product. The molecular formula of the starting material, Compound X, is given as C₁₁H₁₂O. The reaction conditions (heating with a base) suggest an isomerization or rearrangement, so the product likely has the same molecular formula, C₁₁H₁₂O.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C₁₁H₁₂O, the DBE = (2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2 = (2*11 + 2 - 12)/2 = 6. This indicates a combination of rings and/or double/triple bonds, with a benzene ring (4 DBEs) being very likely.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   δ 197.7 ppm: This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), most likely a ketone or aldehyde. This accounts for 1 DBE.\n    *   δ 126.9 - 144.1 ppm: This region contains 8 carbon signals, typical for aromatic and vinylic (C=C) carbons. The benzene ring accounts for 4 DBEs and the remaining DBE is likely a C=C double bond.\n    *   δ 21.3 ppm and δ 28.4 ppm: These are in the aliphatic region, corresponding to two separate methyl (CH₃) groups.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): These two signals are singlets, each integrating to 3 protons. This confirms the presence of two methyl groups that are not coupled to any adjacent protons. This matches the two methyl carbons found in the ¹³C spectrum.\n    *   δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d): This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a classic sign of a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d): These are two doublets, each for a single proton, in the vinylic region. The fact that they are doublets implies they are coupled to each other, indicating a `-CH=CH-` group. The large difference in their chemical shifts suggests they are part of an α,β-unsaturated system.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product's Structure:**\n    1.  We have a para-substituted benzene ring. One substituent must be one of the methyl groups (from δ 2.28 or 2.31). This forms a *p-tolyl* group.\n    2.  We have a second methyl group (from δ 2.31 or 2.28) and a ketone (C=O, δ 197.7). A `CH₃-C(=O)-` (acetyl) group would explain the singlet nature of this methyl group.\n    3.  We have a `-CH=CH-` group.\n    4.  Let's combine these fragments: a p-tolyl group (`CH₃-C₆H₄-`), an acetyl group (`-CO-CH₃`), and a `-CH=CH-` linker.\n    5.  The only way to connect these to satisfy the valency and get the formula C₁₁H₁₂O is `CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CO-CH₃`. This structure is **4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n    6.  Let's verify this structure with the NMR data:\n        *   `CH₃(Ar)-`: Singlet, matches (e.g., δ 2.28).\n        *   `-C₆H₄-`: Two doublets (para-substitution), matches δ 7.08 and 7.71.\n        *   `-CH=CH-CO-`: The proton α to the carbonyl (C=O) is expected around δ 6.5-6.8, and the proton β to the carbonyl is further downfield, around δ 7.5. This perfectly matches the signals at δ 6.75 and δ 7.68.\n        *   `-CO-CH₃`: Singlet, matches (e.g., δ 2.31).\n    7.  The proposed product structure, 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one, is fully consistent with all NMR data.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe reaction is an isomerization of Compound X to 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. This means Compound X must also have the formula C₁₁H₁₂O and must contain the same core structural elements that are preserved in the reaction, namely the p-tolyl group.\n\nLet's examine the given options for Compound X:\n*   A) 2-styrylepoxide (C₁₀H₁₀O): Incorrect molecular formula.\n*   B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane (C₁₁H₁₂O): Contains a *phenyl* group (`C₆H₅-`), not a *p-tolyl* group (`CH₃-C₆H₄-`). It cannot form the p-tolyl product.\n*   C) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane (C₁₁H₁₂O): Also contains a *phenyl* group, not a *p-tolyl* group. It cannot form the product.\n*   D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (C₁₁H₁₂O): The name \"4-methylstyryl\" is another name for a *p-tolyl-vinyl* group. This molecule contains a p-tolyl group. Its structure is `CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`. This is the only option that contains the necessary p-tolyl backbone to form the identified product.\n\nThe reaction is a known type of rearrangement where a vinyl epoxide (or allylic epoxide) isomerizes to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound under thermal or catalytic (acid/base) conditions.\nStarting Material (D): `CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH-O-CH₂` (epoxide)\nProduct: `CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CO-CH₃` (methyl ketone)\n\nThe transformation of the epoxide moiety `-CH(O)CH₂-` into the methyl ketone moiety `-CO-CH₃-` is a plausible isomerization.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the product's NMR spectra, the product is 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. The only starting material among the options that has the correct molecular formula and contains the required p-tolyl group is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<D>>>"
