    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a substituted benzene ring. The substituent already on the ring determines the position (regioselectivity) of the incoming bromine atom.\n\nSubstituents are classified into two main types:\n1.  **Activating Groups (Ortho, Para-directing):** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive than benzene. They direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. Examples here are -CH3 (methyl) and -C2H5 (ethyl).\n2.  **Deactivating Groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive than benzene.\n    *   **Meta-directing Deactivators:** Most deactivating groups direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. This is because the ortho and para positions are more strongly deactivated than the meta position. Examples here are -NO2 (nitro), -COOH (carboxyl), and -COOC2H5 (ethyl carboxylate). The yield of the para-isomer for these substances will be very low.\n    *   **Ortho, Para-directing Deactivators:** Halogens are the main exception. They are deactivating due to their strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect but are ortho, para-directing due to electron donation via resonance. The example here is -Cl (chloro).\n\n### Step 2: Separate Meta-directors from Ortho, Para-directors\n\nBased on the expected major products, we can split the substances into two groups:\n\n*   **Group 1 (Low para-yield):** Meta-directors.\n    *   2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n*   **Group 2 (High para-yield):** Ortho, para-directors.\n    *   1) ะก6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n    *   3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n    *   5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n\nThe final order will have all substances from Group 1 followed by all substances from Group 2.\n\n### Step 3: Order the Substances within Group 1 (Meta-directors)\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is very small but not necessarily zero. The order depends on the strength of the deactivating/meta-directing effect. A stronger deactivating group leads to a higher proportion of the meta-isomer and consequently, a lower proportion of the ortho and para isomers.\n\nWe need to rank the deactivating strength of -NO2, -COOH, and -COOC2H5.\n*   The **-NO2** group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. It will give the highest percentage of meta product and the lowest percentage of para product.\n*   The **-COOH** and **-COOC2H5** groups are also strongly deactivating, but less so than -NO2. Between them, the -COOH group is generally considered slightly more deactivating than the -COOC2H5 group. Therefore, the ester will allow for a slightly higher proportion of non-meta products compared to the carboxylic acid.\n\nSo, the order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\nThis means the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: C6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5.\nIn terms of substance numbers, the order is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### Step 4: Order the Substances within Group 2 (Ortho, Para-directors)\n\nFor ortho, para-directing groups, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho product. A higher para/ortho ratio results in a higher overall percentage yield of the para-isomer. This ratio is primarily influenced by two factors: steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n1.  **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):**\n    *   Both -CH3 and -C2H5 are activating alkyl groups.\n    *   The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   This increased bulk hinders the attack of the electrophile (bromine) at the adjacent ortho positions more significantly.\n    *   Therefore, ethylbenzene will produce a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n    *   Order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n2.  **Comparing Ethylbenzene (5) and Chlorobenzene (3):**\n    *   The -Cl group is deactivating but ortho, para-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) deactivates the ortho positions (which are closer) more strongly than the para position.\n    *   This electronic effect strongly favors substitution at the para position, leading to a very high para/ortho ratio for halobenzenes.\n    *   This effect is typically stronger than the steric effect of alkyl groups. Experimental data confirms that bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (around 88-89%). This percentage is generally higher than for toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene (which is expected to be higher than toluene, e.g., ~75-80%, though some data sources vary).\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene is expected to give the highest yield of para-isomer among these three.\n    *   Order: Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nCombining the order for Group 2: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Orders of Both Groups\n\nNow, we combine the sorted groups to get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield.\n\nGroup 1 order: **4 < 6 < 2**\nGroup 2 order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombined full order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
