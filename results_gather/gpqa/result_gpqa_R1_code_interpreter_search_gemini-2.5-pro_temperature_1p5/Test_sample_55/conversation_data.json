    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state |n, l, m⟩ = |3, 0, 0⟩ to the final state |1, 0, 0⟩ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n    The selection rules for E1 transitions are:\n    *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1\n    *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1\n    *   Δn is not restricted, but for a decay (spontaneous emission), energy must be released, so n must decrease.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State**\n    Let the intermediate state be |n', l', m'⟩.\n    *   **First Transition: |3, 0, 0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩**\n        *   Initial state has l=0. To satisfy Δl=±1, the intermediate state must have l'=1.\n        *   Initial state has m=0. To satisfy Δm=0,±1, the intermediate state can have m' = -1, 0, or +1.\n        *   The principal quantum number n must decrease from n=3. The options provided suggest the intermediate state has n'=2, which is a valid decay path (3s → 2p).\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2, 1, -1⟩, |2, 1, 0⟩, and |2, 1, 1⟩.\n\n    *   **Second Transition: |n', l', m'⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩**\n        *   Let's check if a transition from our potential intermediate states |2, 1, m'⟩ to the final state |1, 0, 0⟩ is allowed.\n        *   The intermediate state has l'=1, and the final state has l_f=0. So, Δl = 0 - 1 = -1, which is an allowed transition.\n        *   The intermediate state can have m' = -1, 0, or +1, and the final state has m_f=0. So, Δm = 0 - m'. This is -1, 0, or +1 for m'=1, 0, -1 respectively. All are allowed.\n        *   Thus, all three routes proposed in the options (A, B, and D) are valid cascade paths according to the selection rules.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n    The \"probability\" of a specific transition route refers to its branching ratio: the fraction of atoms starting in |3,0,0⟩ that will follow that specific path to reach |1,0,0⟩. This is the product of the branching ratios of the two sequential steps.\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 1: P(|3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, m'⟩)**\n        *   The initial state |3, 0, 0⟩ (a 3s orbital) is spherically symmetric (l=0). The decay process is governed by the interaction Hamiltonian, which, when averaged over all possible emission directions and polarizations of the photon, shows no preference for the final magnetic quantum number m'.\n        *   A more formal argument using the Wigner-Eckart theorem shows that the transition rates Γ(|3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, m'⟩) are identical for all three possible values of m' (-1, 0, 1).\n        *   Since there are three equally probable final states for this decay step, the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them.\n        *   Therefore, the branching ratio for transitioning to any specific m' state is 1/3.\n            *   P(|3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, -1⟩) = 1/3\n            *   P(|3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, 0⟩) = 1/3\n            *   P(|3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, 1⟩) = 1/3\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 2: P(|2, 1, m'⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩)**\n        *   Now consider an atom in one of the intermediate states, |2, 1, m'⟩ (a 2p orbital). We need to find its decay channels.\n        *   For a dipole transition, n must decrease. The only possibility is n_final = 1.\n        *   For n=1, the only possible value for orbital angular momentum is l=0.\n        *   The transition l'=1 to l_f=0 is allowed (Δl = -1).\n        *   Therefore, the *only* state to which |2, 1, m'⟩ can decay via a single-photon electric dipole transition is the |1, 0, 0⟩ state.\n        *   Since this is the only possible decay channel, it occurs with a probability of 1. The branching ratio for this step is 1.\n\n    *   **Total Probability**\n        *   The total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n        *   Let's take the route specified in option D: |3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, 0⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩.\n        *   Total Probability = P(|3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, 0⟩) × P(|2, 1, 0⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩)\n        *   Total Probability = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    *   A) Route is valid, but probability 1/4 is incorrect. The correct probability is 1/3.\n    *   B) Route is valid, but probability 1/4 is incorrect. The correct probability is 1/3.\n    *   C) The route is likely a typo for |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩, but the probability 2/3 is incorrect.\n    *   D) The route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ is valid, and the calculated probability is 1/3. This matches the option.\n\nFinal conclusion is that option D presents a valid decay path with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<D>>>"
