    "To solve this problem, we need to find the partition function Z for a system of three spins, S1, S2, and S3, where each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J [S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all possible states (microstates) of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n\nSince we have three spins and each can take two values (+1 or -1), there are a total of 2^3 = 8 possible microstates for the system.

    "The problem asks for the partition function Z of a system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, where each spin can take values +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J [S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n\nThe partition function Z is defined as the sum over all possible microstates of the system of the Boltzmann factor e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n\nSince there are three spins, each with two possible values, the total number of microstates is 2^3 = 8. To find Z, we need to calculate the energy E for each of these 8 states, and then sum their corresponding Boltzmann factors.\n\nLet's list all 8 states and calculate their energies:\nWe can classify the states by the number of +1 spins.\n\n1.  **All spins are the same (2 states):**\n    *   **State 1:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n        E₁ = -J [(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   **State 2:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n        E₂ = -J [(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    So, there are **2 states** with energy E = **-3J**.\n\n2.  **Two spins are the same, one is different (6 states):**\n    *   **State 3:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1)\n        E₃ = -J [(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J [1 - 1 - 1] = -J [-1] = J\n    *   **State 4:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1)\n        E₄ = -J [(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J [-1 + 1 - 1] = -J [-1] = J\n    *   **State 5:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1)\n        E₅ = -J [(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J [-1 - 1 + 1] = -J [-1] = J\n    *   **State 6:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1)\n        E₆ = -J [(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J [1 - 1 - 1] = -J [-1] = J\n    *   **State 7:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1)\n        E₇ = -J [(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J [-1 + 1 - 1] = -J [-1] = J\n    *   **State 8:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1)\n        E₈ = -J [(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J [-1 - 1 + 1] = -J [-1] = J\n    So, there are **6 states** with energy E = **J**.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states. Since we have states with the same energy (degeneracy), we can write the sum as:\nZ = (degeneracy of E₁) * e^(-βE₁) + (degeneracy of E₂) * e^(-βE₂)\n\nFrom our calculations:\n*   The energy level E₁ = -3J has a degeneracy g₁ = 2.\n*   The energy level E₂ = J has a degeneracy g₂ = 6.\n\nNow, we plug these values into the partition function formula:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * J)\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z = 2e^(-3Jβ) + 6e^(Jβ)\nB) Z = 2e^(2Jβ) + 6e^(-2Jβ)\nC) Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\nD) Z = 6e^(2Jβ) + 2e^(-2Jβ)\n\nThe calculated partition function matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
