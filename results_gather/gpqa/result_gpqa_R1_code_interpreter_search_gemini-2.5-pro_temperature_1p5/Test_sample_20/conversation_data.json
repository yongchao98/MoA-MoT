    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Part 1: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\nThe first part of the question asks to identify the compound that does **not** show tautomerism from the pair: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton and a shift of a double bond. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen on an sp³-hybridized carbon).\n\n2.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure (Keto form):** It's a six-membered ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH₂- groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these -CH₂- groups is adjacent to two carbonyl groups, meaning they possess highly acidic α-hydrogens.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** The presence of these α-hydrogens allows for keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it can undergo tautomerization at all three keto sites to form 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol).\n    *   **Stability:** The resulting tautomer, phloroglucinol, is an aromatic compound, which makes it extremely stable. The equilibrium strongly favors this aromatic \"enol\" form.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione clearly **shows** tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (specifically, 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It's a six-membered ring with two carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp²-hybridized and do not have the typical α-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon required for simple keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Any rearrangement would disrupt the stable conjugated system without forming a more stable product (like an aromatic ring). Therefore, benzoquinone is not considered to show tautomerism under normal conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Identifying Compound A:** Based on the analysis, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, A = benzoquinone.\n\n---\n\n**Part 2: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\nThe second part of the question asks to identify which compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, will show optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the central carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will show** optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers, R and S).\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar. It possesses a center of symmetry (an inversion center) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. A molecule with a center of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule, it cannot have an enantiomer and is not optically active. Therefore, it does **not** show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Identifying Compound B:** Based on the analysis, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n---\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches the pair described in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
