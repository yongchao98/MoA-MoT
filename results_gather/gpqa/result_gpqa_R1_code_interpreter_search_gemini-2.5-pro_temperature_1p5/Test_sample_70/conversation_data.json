    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Information:**\n    *   System of five exoplanets (Planet_1 to Planet_5).\n    *   They orbit the same star.\n    *   The orbits are circular.\n    *   The orbital periods (T) are in a ratio of T_1 : T_2 : T_3 : T_4 : T_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n    *   All planets have the same albedo (A).\n\n3.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   T_star = Star's effective temperature\n    *   R_star = Star's radius\n    *   a = Semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit)\n    *   A = Planet's albedo\n\n4.  **Simplify the Formula:** Since all planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are constants for this system. The problem also states that the albedo (A) is the same for all planets. This means the terms T_star, R_star, and (1 - A) are constant across all five planets. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature depends only on the orbital distance 'a'.\n    The relationship can be simplified to a proportionality:\n    T_eq ∝ (1 / a)^(1/2) or T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\n5.  **Connect Orbital Distance (a) and Orbital Period (T):** I need to find the relationship between the temperatures, but I'm given the periods, not the distances. I must use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, which relates the orbital period (T) and the semi-major axis (a) for planets orbiting the same star.\n    Kepler's Third Law states: T² ∝ a³\n    I can rearrange this to solve for 'a' in terms of 'T':\n    a ∝ T^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Combine the Relationships:** Now I can substitute the relationship from Kepler's Law into my simplified temperature formula.\n    *   We know T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n    *   We know a ∝ T^(2/3)\n    *   Therefore, T_eq ∝ 1 / √(T^(2/3))\n    *   Simplifying the exponent: √(T^(2/3)) = (T^(2/3))^(1/2) = T^((2/3) * (1/2)) = T^(1/3)\n    *   So, the final relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period is: T_eq ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Formulate the Ratio:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T_eq_4 / T_eq_2). Using the proportionality from the previous step:\n    T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = (1 / T_4^(1/3)) / (1 / T_2^(1/3))\n    T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = T_2^(1/3) / T_4^(1/3)\n    T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = (T_2 / T_4)^(1/3)\n\n8.  **Use the Given Data:** From the problem statement, the ratio of orbital periods is:\n    T_1 : T_2 : T_3 : T_4 : T_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5\n    From this, we can find the ratio of the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    T_2 / T_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Now, I substitute this value back into the temperature ratio equation. I will use a simple Python script for the calculation to ensure accuracy.\n    *   Ratio = (T_2 / T_4)^(1/3) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n# The formula is (T2 / T4)^(1/3), where T2 and T4 are the orbital periods.\n# The ratio of periods T2:T4 is 2:3.5.\n\nt2 = 2.0\nt4 = 3.5\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the periods\nperiod_ratio = t2 / t4\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio, which is the cube root of the period ratio\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.8299298565193988\n</execute_result>\n\n10. **Final Answer Formulation:** The calculated value is approximately 0.8299. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) ~0.69\n    B) ~0.57\n    C) ~0.75\n    D) ~0.83\nThe value ~0.83 is the closest match to my calculated result.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of an exoplanet is determined by the energy it receives from its host star and its own properties. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n\nWe are asked for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. Let's write down the ratio:\n\nT_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_4))^(1/2) * (1 - A_4)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same and cancel out. The problem states that the planets have the same albedo, so A_4 = A_2, and the (1 - A) term also cancels out. The equation simplifies to:\n\nT_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = [(1 / a_4)^(1/2)] / [(1 / a_2)^(1/2)]\nT_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)\n\nWe are given the orbital periods (P), not the orbital distances (a). We need to relate these two quantities using Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion. For planets orbiting the same star, the law states:\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nThis can be rearranged to express `a` in terms of `P`:\n\na ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nNow we can substitute this relationship back into our temperature ratio equation:\n\na_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)\n\nT_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = [ (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\nT_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\nT_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5. Therefore, we can set P_2 = 2 and P_4 = 3.5 in arbitrary units.\n\nT_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating this value:\nT_eq_4 / T_eq_2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.69\nB) ~0.57\nC) ~0.75\nD) ~0.83\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
