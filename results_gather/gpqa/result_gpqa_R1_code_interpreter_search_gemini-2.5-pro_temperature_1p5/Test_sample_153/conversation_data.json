    "*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound containing the most abundant isotope of each element.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The intensity ratio of M+ to M+2 is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This specific isotopic pattern is a strong indicator of the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular formulas and weights of the options for the ³⁵Cl isotope:\n        *   All options (A, B, C, D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n        *   Molecular Weight = (7 × 12.01) + (5 × 1.01) + (1 × 35.45) + (2 × 16.00) ≈ 156.5 g/mol. Using integer masses for C (12), H (1), O (16), and ³⁵Cl (35), the MW is (7×12) + (5×1) + 35 + (2×16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches the M+ peak. The M+2 peak at 158 would correspond to the molecule containing the ³⁷Cl isotope.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   There is a very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹. This is a textbook signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules causes this significant broadening.\n    *   There is a strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carbonyl in a conjugated system, such as an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is characteristic of the highly deshielded proton of a carboxylic acid. The integration of 1H confirms it's a single proton, and it appears as a singlet because it has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-substitution makes the two protons ortho to one substituent chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent. The downfield position of these signals indicates that the benzene ring is attached to electron-withdrawing groups (like -Cl and -COOH). The most deshielded protons (8.02 ppm) are likely the two protons ortho to the strongly electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The protons at 7.72 ppm would be the two protons ortho to the chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Contains an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. The NMR would show 3 distinct aromatic protons, not the 2H/2H doublet pattern.\n    *   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloride. It lacks the acidic O-H group, so it would not show the broad IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n    *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) isomer. It has a carboxylic acid group, but its four aromatic protons would be non-equivalent, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the ¹H NMR spectrum, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule fits all the data perfectly.\n        *   It has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope).\n        *   It contains one chlorine atom.\n        *   It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR data.\n        *   It is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene, which explains the characteristic ¹H NMR pattern of two doublets, each for 2H.\n        *   It has the acidic proton, matching the signal at 11.0 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:** The spectral data points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
