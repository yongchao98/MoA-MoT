    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product and its NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence\n\n1.  **Formation of Product 1:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. The product (P1) is a C₁₀H₁₄O ketone based on the proton count from the ¹H NMR (2+10+2=14H) and the IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ (a typical ketone C=O stretch). The molecular formula C₁₀H₁₄O has 4 degrees of unsaturation. The adamantane cage is tricyclic (3 degrees of unsaturation), and the ketone C=O accounts for the fourth. Thus, P1 is a saturated tricyclic ketone, an isomer of adamantanone. The provided ¹H NMR data (with a peak at 4.79 ppm) is unusual for a simple adamantanone and likely corresponds to a rearranged cage structure or may contain a typo/be a red herring. We will proceed by assuming a plausible structure for P1 based on subsequent reactions.\n\n2.  **Formation of Product 2:** Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of ketones to alcohols. The fact that it is \"heated\" suggests that the resulting alcohol may subsequently undergo dehydration (elimination of water) to form an alkene. Let's call the intermediate alcohol P2' and the final alkene product P2.\n    *   P1 (Ketone, C₁₀H₁₄O) --(MPV reduction)--> P2' (Alcohol, C₁₀H₁₆O)\n    *   P2' (Alcohol, C₁₀H₁₆O) --(Heat, -H₂O)--> P2 (Alkene, C₁₀H₁₄)\n\n3.  **Formation of Product 3:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This confirms that Product 2 must be an alkene. The ozonolysis of a cyclic alkene like P2 (C₁₀H₁₄) will produce a single, larger molecule containing two new carbonyl groups. The resulting product, P3, will have the formula C₁₀H₁₄O₂.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the structure of the intermediates\n\nThe core of the problem lies in identifying the specific structures. The reaction pathway starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane can be complex. However, a common and logical sequence taught in organic chemistry involves rearrangements of the adamantane cage. A very plausible pathway, even if the structure of P1 is not immediately obvious, is one that starts with the most common isomer of adamantanone.\n\n*   **Assume Product 1 (P1) is adamantan-2-one.** This is the most stable and common ketone with an adamantane framework. It's plausible that the harsh conditions rearrange the 1,3-disubstituted starting material to this structure. We will proceed with this assumption, treating the given NMR data for P1 as potentially erroneous or misleading.\n*   **Formation of Product 2 (P2):**\n    *   Reduction of adamantan-2-one gives adamantan-2-ol (P2').\n    *   Acid-catalyzed dehydration of adamantan-2-ol is a well-known reaction that proceeds with a skeletal rearrangement (Wagner-Meerwein type). It does not form the highly strained anti-Bredt alkene \"adamantene\". Instead, it rearranges to form the thermodynamically more stable alkene, **protoadamantene**. The specific isomer formed is **tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene**.\n    *   So, **P2 = protoadamantene**. The double bond in this structure is between a tertiary carbon (C4, a bridgehead) and a secondary carbon (C5). The structure is ...-C(H)=C(H)-..., i.e., it has a proton on each carbon of the double bond.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3 and analyze its NMR spectrum\n\n*   **Formation of Product 3 (P3):** Reductive ozonolysis of P2 (protoadamantene) cleaves the C4=C5 double bond. Since P2 is cyclic, this results in a single, larger molecule where the C4 and C5 atoms are converted to aldehyde groups (-CHO). The tricyclic skeleton of P2 is opened to a bicyclic skeleton. The resulting molecule, P3, is **bicyclo[4.3.1]decane-4,5-dicarbaldehyde**.\n*   **¹H NMR of Product 3:** We need to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton. The most deshielded protons in P3 will be the two aldehyde protons (H-C4=O and H-C5=O), which typically resonate at δ 9-10 ppm. These two protons are in different chemical environments.\n    1.  **Aldehyde proton at C5 (H₅-CHO):** The C5 carbon of the aldehyde is bonded to the C6 carbon of the bicyclic frame. In the parent protoadamantane structure, C6 is a methylene (CH₂) group. Therefore, the H₅-CHO proton is vicinally coupled (³J coupling) to the two protons on C6. This would split its signal into a **triplet** (by the n+1 rule), assuming the two C6 protons have similar coupling constants.\n    2.  **Aldehyde proton at C4 (H₄-CHO):** The C4 carbon of the aldehyde is bonded to the C3 carbon of the bicyclic frame. C3 is a methine (CH) group (it is a bridgehead). Therefore, the H₄-CHO proton is vicinally coupled to the single proton on C3, which would split its signal into a **doublet**.\n\n    Now we consider the options and potential for more complex coupling. Rigid bicyclic systems like P3 often exhibit significant long-range (e.g., ⁴J) couplings, especially through \"W\"-shaped arrangements of bonds.\n    *   The H₄-CHO proton (which is a doublet from ³J coupling) has plausible W-paths to protons on C2 and C8. If these two protons are magnetically equivalent, they would split the signal into a triplet. The resulting pattern would be a **doublet of triplets**.\n    *   The H₅-CHO proton (which is a triplet from ³J coupling) is less likely to have strong long-range couplings due to the local geometry.\n\n    The question asks for the coupling pattern of the *most* deshielded proton. This would be one of the two aldehyde protons. Let's analyze the options given: A) pentet, B) doublet of triplets, C) triplet of triplets, D) triplet.\n    *   We have derived plausible patterns of \"doublet of triplets\" (for H₄-CHO) and \"triplet\" (for H₅-CHO). Both are represented in the options.\n    *   Which proton is more deshielded? The aldehyde at C4 is attached to a tertiary, sterically crowded bridge-fusion carbon, while the aldehyde at C5 is attached to a less-substituted secondary carbon. The higher substitution and steric compression at C4 make it reasonable to assume the H₄-CHO proton is the most deshielded.\n    *   Therefore, the most likely answer is the coupling pattern for H₄-CHO.\n\nThe coupling pattern for the H₄-CHO proton arises from:\n1.  Splitting by the single vicinal proton on C3, resulting in a **doublet**.\n2.  Further splitting of this doublet by the two long-range (⁴J) protons (on C2 and C8), resulting in a **triplet**.\n\nThe final pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
