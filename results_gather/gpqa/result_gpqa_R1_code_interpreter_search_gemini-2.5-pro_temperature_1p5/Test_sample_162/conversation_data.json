    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction and Stoichiometry**\n    The dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide, a base, in a strong monobasic acid (H+) is a neutralization reaction:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n2.  **Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n    First, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Atomic mass of Fe ≈ 55.845 g/mol\n    *   Atomic mass of O ≈ 15.999 g/mol\n    *   Atomic mass of H ≈ 1.008 g/mol\n    Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n\n    Next, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ from the given mass:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 0.00093575 mol.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Required Volume of Acid**\n    The problem asks for the minimum volume of acid required. A common simplification in such problems is to first calculate the volume based purely on the stoichiometric amount needed for the reaction.\n    From the balanced equation, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺.\n    Moles of H⁺ needed = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n    Moles of H⁺ needed = 3 × 0.00093575 mol = 0.00280725 mol.\n\n    The acid is 0.1 M, which means 0.1 moles of H⁺ per liter. We can calculate the volume of acid needed:\n    Volume = Moles / Molarity\n    Volume = 0.00280725 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0280725 L.\n\n    To convert the volume to cm³, we multiply by 1000 (since 1 L = 1000 cm³):\n    Volume = 0.0280725 L × 1000 cm³/L = 28.07 cm³.\n\n    This calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the value of **28.05 cm³** provided in option C. The small difference can be attributed to rounding of atomic masses. This strongly suggests that this is the intended method for calculating the volume.\n\n4.  **Determine the pH of the Final Solution**\n    To dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ completely with the *minimum* amount of acid, the final solution must be saturated. This means the dissolution equilibrium is met:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium is governed by the solubility product constant, Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³.\n\n    First, calculate the concentration of Fe³⁺ in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution:\n    [Fe³⁺] = Moles of Fe³⁺ / Total Volume = 0.00093575 mol / 0.1 L = 0.0093575 M.\n\n    The pH of the solution will be determined by the concentration of H⁺ (and thus OH⁻) at equilibrium. This depends on the Ksp value for Fe(OH)₃. Literature values for Ksp vary, but a typical value is around 10⁻³⁸ - 10⁻³⁹. Let's test the pH from option C, which is **2.04**.\n\n    If pH = 2.04, we can find the pOH:\n    pOH = 14.00 - pH = 14.00 - 2.04 = 11.96.\n\n    From the pOH, we find the hydroxide ion concentration:\n    [OH⁻] = 10⁻ᵖᴼᴴ = 10⁻¹¹·⁹⁶ M.\n\n    Now, we can use our calculated [Fe³⁺] and this [OH⁻] to see what the implied Ksp value would be:\n    Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (0.0093575) × (10⁻¹¹·⁹⁶)³ ≈ (0.00936) × (1.318 × 10⁻³⁶) ≈ 1.23 × 10⁻³⁸.\n\n    This calculated Ksp value of 1.23 × 10⁻³⁸ is a very plausible value for iron(III) hydroxide. Therefore, the pH of 2.04 is consistent with the chemical principles governing the dissolution.\n\n*Note on consistency:* Rigorously, the volume of acid calculated in step 3 (28.07 cm³) is only enough to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃. It does not provide the additional H⁺ ions needed to keep the final pH at 2.04. However, in the context of multiple-choice questions, it is common for the problem to be broken down into two simplified, independent calculations: one for the stoichiometric volume and one for the equilibrium pH. Following this likely intended method, the answer is derived.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated stoichiometric volume is ~28.07 cm³, matching the volume in option C. The pH of 2.04 in option C is consistent with a reasonable Ksp value for the dissolution equilibrium.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
