    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** We need to find the joint probability of two sequential quantum measurements. The process involves:\n    a. Finding the probability of the first measurement (P=0).\n    b. Determining the new state of the system after the first measurement (wavefunction collapse).\n    c. Finding the probability of the second measurement (Q=-1) given the new state.\n    d. Multiplying the two probabilities to get the final answer.\n\n2.  **Define the Initial State and Operators:**\n    *   Initial state vector: `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`. This state is not normalized.\n    *   Operator P:\n        ```\n        P = [[0, 1/√2, 0],\n             [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],\n             [0, 1/√2, 0]]\n        ```\n    *   Operator Q:\n        ```\n        Q = [[1, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, -1]]\n        ```\n\n3.  **Step A: First Measurement (P=0)**\n\n    *   **Normalize the initial state:**\n        The norm-squared of the state is `||ψ||² = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n        The normalization constant is `1/√6`.\n        The normalized state is `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`.\n\n    *   **Find the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0:**\n        We need to solve the equation `P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩`, where `|v⟩ = [x, y, z]ᵀ`.\n        ```\n        [[0, 1/√2, 0],    [x]   [0]\n         [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],  * [y] = [0]\n         [0, 1/√2, 0]]     [z]   [0]\n        ```\n        From the first and third rows, `y/√2 = 0`, which means `y = 0`.\n        From the second row, `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0`, which means `x = -z`.\n        Choosing `z = 1`, we get `x = -1`.

Its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries (1, 0, -1), and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n        The eigenvector for Q=-1 corresponds to the third basis vector: `|q_{-1}⟩ = [0, 0, 1]ᵀ`.

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the principles of quantum mechanics for sequential measurements.\n\n**Step 1: Normalize the initial state vector**\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`. Before we can calculate probabilities, this state vector must be normalized. The squared norm of the state is:\n`||ψ||² = ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\nThe normalization constant is `1/√6`. So, the normalized state vector is:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`\n\n**Step 2: First Measurement - Probability of getting P=0**\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` of an operator `P` is given by `|⟨v_λ|ψ_norm⟩|²`, where `|v_λ⟩` is the normalized eigenvector corresponding to `λ`.\n\nFirst, we need to find the eigenvector of operator P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. The operator P is:\n`P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\nWe solve the eigenvalue equation `P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩`, where `|v⟩ = [x, y, z]ᵀ`:\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]ᵀ = [0, 0, 0]ᵀ`\nThis gives us a system of equations:\n1. `(1/√2) * y = 0  => y = 0`\n2. `(1/√2) * x + (1/√2) * z = 0  => x + z = 0  => x = -z`\nAn unnormalized eigenvector is `[-1, 0, 1]ᵀ`.\n\nNow, we normalize this eigenvector, which we'll call `|p₀⟩`:\n`||v||² = (-1)² + 0² + 1² = 2`\nSo, the normalized eigenvector is `|p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]ᵀ`.\n\nNext, we calculate the probability of measuring P=0:\n`Prob(P=0) = |⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n`⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]] * [(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ]`\n`= (1/√12) * [(-1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (1)(1)]`\n`= (1/√12) * (1 + 0 + 1) = 2/√12 = 2/(2√3) = 1/√3`\n`Prob(P=0) = (1/√3)² = 1/3`\n\n**Step 3: State collapse after the first measurement**\n\nAfter measuring P and obtaining the result 0, the state of the system \"collapses\" to the corresponding eigenvector `|p₀⟩`.\nThe new state of the system is `|ψ'⟩ = |p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]ᵀ`.\n\n**Step 4: Second Measurement - Probability of getting Q=-1 from the new state**\n\nNow we measure the observable Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`. The operator Q is:\n`Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\nThis is a diagonal matrix, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries (1, 0, -1), and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n\nWe are interested in the outcome Q=-1. The corresponding normalized eigenvector, `|q₋₁⟩`, is `[0, 0, 1]ᵀ`.\n\nThe probability of measuring Q=-1 from the state `|ψ'⟩` is:\n`Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|²`\n`⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] * [(1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]ᵀ]`\n`= (1/√2) * [(0)(-1) + (0)(0) + (1)(1)]`\n`= 1/√2`\n`Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = (1/√2)² = 1/2`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final joint probability**\n\nThe probability of getting P=0 and then Q=-1 is the product of the probabilities calculated in the previous steps.\n`Prob(P=0 and Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)`\n`= (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\n<<<C>>>"
