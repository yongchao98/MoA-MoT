    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The spin-1/2 particle is in a magnetic field **B** = B **ẑ** (pointing in the +z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian for this system is H₀ = -**μ** ⋅ **B**, where **μ** = γ**S** is the magnetic moment operator and **S** is the spin operator.\n*   Substituting the values, H₀ = -γ(**S** ⋅ B **ẑ**) = -γB S₂.\n*   The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the system is in its lowest energy eigenstate.\n*   The eigenvalues of S₂ are +ħ/2 (spin-up, |↑⟩₂) and -ħ/2 (spin-down, |↓⟩₂).\n*   The energy levels are E = -γB mₛħ, where mₛ = ±1/2.\n    *   E₊ (for spin-up, mₛ=+1/2): -γB(ħ/2)\n    *   E₋ (for spin-down, mₛ=-1/2): +γB(ħ/2)\n*   Assuming γ and B are positive, the lowest energy state is E₊, which corresponds to the spin-up state |↑⟩₂.\n*   Therefore, the state of the particle at t=0 is |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩₂. In the standard S₂ basis, this is represented by the vector `[[1], [0]]`.\n\n### 2. Define the System for t > 0\n\n*   At t=0, the magnetic field is switched to **B'** = B **ŷ** (pointing in the +y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian is H = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γB Sᵧ.\n*   The state of the system will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation, governed by this new Hamiltonian H. The time evolution is given by |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Time Evolution\n\nWe want to find the expectation value (average) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ₂(t)⟩, which is equal to γ⟨S₂(t)⟩.\n⟨S₂(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S₂ |ψ(t)⟩.\n\n#### Method 1: Heisenberg Picture (Equation of Motion)\n\nA more direct way to find the oscillation frequency is to look at the time evolution of the expectation values of the spin operators (Ehrenfest's theorem).\n\nThe equation of motion for an operator A is d⟨A⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨[A, H]⟩.\nOur Hamiltonian is H = -γB Sᵧ.\n\n1.  **For ⟨S₂⟩:**\n    d⟨S₂⟩/dt = (1/iħ) ⟨[S₂, H]⟩ = (1/iħ) ⟨[S₂, -γB Sᵧ]⟩ = (-γB/iħ) ⟨[S₂, Sᵧ]⟩\n    Using the commutation relation [Sᵧ, S₂] = iħ Sₓ, we get [S₂, Sᵧ] = -iħ Sₓ.\n    d⟨S₂⟩/dt = (-γB/iħ) (-iħ ⟨Sₓ⟩) = γB ⟨Sₓ⟩.\n\n2.  **For ⟨Sₓ⟩:**\n    d⟨Sₓ⟩/dt = (1/iħ) ⟨[Sₓ, H]⟩ = (1/iħ) ⟨[Sₓ, -γB Sᵧ]⟩ = (-γB/iħ) ⟨[Sₓ, Sᵧ]⟩\n    Using the commutation relation [Sₓ, Sᵧ] = iħ S₂, we get:\n    d⟨Sₓ⟩/dt = (-γB/iħ) (iħ ⟨S₂⟩) = -γB ⟨S₂⟩.\n\nNow we have a system of two coupled differential equations:\n(i) d⟨S₂⟩/dt = γB ⟨Sₓ⟩\n(ii) d⟨Sₓ⟩/dt = -γB ⟨S₂⟩\n\nTo solve this, we can differentiate the first equation with respect to time:\nd²⟨S₂⟩/dt² = γB (d⟨Sₓ⟩/dt)\n\nNow substitute equation (ii) into this:\nd²⟨S₂⟩/dt² = γB (-γB ⟨S₂⟩)\nd²⟨S₂⟩/dt² = -(γB)² ⟨S₂⟩\n\nThis is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, d²x/dt² = -ω²x.\nBy comparing the two equations, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation ω is:\nω = γB\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector, ⟨**S**⟩, precesses around the new magnetic field direction (**ŷ**) at an angular frequency ω = γB, which is the Larmor frequency. The projection of this precessing vector onto any other axis (like the z-axis) will oscillate with this same angular frequency.\n\nThe question asks for the \"oscillation frequency\". Given the context of physics problems and the form of the answers, this refers to the angular frequency ω.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's moment, ⟨μ₂(t)⟩ = γ⟨S₂(t)⟩, oscillates with an angular frequency of ω = γB.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
