    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The objective is to find a mutation that eliminates an anti-nutritional compound. This is best achieved by completely knocking out the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis. The most effective way to do this is to create a non-functional or severely truncated protein.\n\n2.  **Understand the Intact Gene:**\n    *   The sequence starts with `5’-ATG...`, which is the universal start codon (codes for Methionine). This is where protein synthesis begins.\n    *   The sequence ends with `...TGA-3’`, which is a stop codon. This is where protein synthesis terminates.\n    *   The mutations are in the first exon, near the beginning of the gene. A mutation early in the sequence has a higher probability of disrupting the entire protein structure and function.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Mutant's Genetic Change:** We need to compare each mutant sequence to the intact gene, break them down into codons (groups of three DNA bases), and determine the effect on the resulting amino acid sequence.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene Sequence:** `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n    *   **Amino Acids:** `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr ...`\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Sequence: `ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Comparison: The second codon `TTT` changes to `TTC`, and the third codon `CTC` changes to `TAC`.\n        *   Effect: `TTT` -> `TTC` codes for the same amino acid, Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a *silent mutation*. `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a *missense mutation*.\n        *   Conclusion: The protein has one amino acid swapped for another. This might alter or reduce the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Sequence: `ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Comparison: The second codon `TTT` changes to `TTC` (silent mutation, as above). The third codon `CTC` changes to `TAA`.\n        *   Effect: `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. In mRNA, this would be `UAA`.\n        *   Conclusion: This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will halt prematurely after the second amino acid. The resulting product would be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (`Met-Phe`). A protein this truncated is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Sequence: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT ...`\n        *   Comparison: Let's align the mutant to the intact sequence. It appears there is an insertion of a single nucleotide 'T' after the second codon (`TTT`).\n            *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ...`\n            *   Mutant: `ATG TTT T ACG CTG GTG TCA ...`\n        *   Effect: This single base insertion causes a **frameshift mutation**. The three-letter reading frame for codons is shifted. All codons downstream of the insertion are read incorrectly, leading to a completely scrambled sequence of amino acids from that point forward. A frameshift almost always results in a non-functional protein and frequently creates a premature stop codon by chance.\n        *   Conclusion: Like the nonsense mutation, a frameshift is a catastrophic event for the protein and is very likely to eliminate its function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Sequence: `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ...`\n        *   Comparison: `CTC` changes to `TAC` (a missense mutation, Leu -> Tyr). The codon `GGT` (Glycine) has been deleted.\n        *   Effect: This is a combination of a missense mutation and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of exactly three bases). Because three bases were deleted, the reading frame is preserved for the rest of the gene.\n        *   Conclusion: The final protein will be missing one amino acid and have another one swapped. While this will alter the protein, it's less likely to cause a complete loss of function compared to a nonsense or frameshift mutation that affects the entire downstream sequence.\n\n4.  **Compare the Strongest Candidates:**\n    *   Both **Mutant 2 (Nonsense)** and **Mutant 3 (Frameshift)** will almost certainly result in a non-functional protein.\n    *   Mutant 2 creates a stop codon at the 3rd position, leading to a 2-amino acid product.\n    *   Mutant 3 scrambles the entire amino acid sequence after the 2nd position.\n    *   Both outcomes effectively eliminate the synthesis of the functional, full-length protein. Therefore, both mutations are highly probable to achieve the desired outcome of eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nGiven the choices, both D (Mutant 2) and A (Mutant 3) are excellent answers. However, a nonsense mutation leading to a stop codon is the most direct and unambiguous way to terminate protein synthesis and guarantee a non-functional product.\n\nFinal evaluation leads us to Mutant 2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
