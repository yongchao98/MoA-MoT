    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Principle of Conservation of Energy.**\n    In any isolated system, the total energy is conserved. For a relativistic particle moving in a conservative potential field, the total energy is the sum of its relativistic energy ($E=\\gamma mc^2$) and its potential energy ($U$). This total energy remains constant.\n    The relativistic energy $E=\\gamma mc^2$ includes both the rest mass energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($T = (\\gamma-1)mc^2$). The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$.\n    The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is given by Hooke's Law, $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\n2.  **Define the Total Conserved Energy.**\n    The total energy of the system, $E_{total}$, is given by:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    This quantity must be the same at all points in the particle's motion.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Energy at the Point of Maximum Displacement.**\n    At the point of maximum displacement, the amplitude is $x=A$. At this point, the mass momentarily stops before reversing its direction. Therefore, its velocity is $v=0$.\n    *   $x = A$\n    *   $v = 0$\n    *   The Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    *   The potential energy is maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy is:\n        $E_{total} = (1) \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Energy at the Point of Maximum Speed.**\n    The speed is maximum when the mass passes through the equilibrium position, where the potential energy is zero.\n    *   $x = 0$\n    *   The speed is maximum: $v = v_{max}$.\n    *   The potential energy is minimum: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value, let's call it $\\gamma_{max}$: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The total energy is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$.\n\n5.  **Apply Energy Conservation.**\n    Equate the total energy expressions from steps 3 and 4:\n    Energy at max displacement = Energy at max speed\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n6.  **Solve for $\\gamma_{max}$.**\n    Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n7.  **Solve for $v_{max}$.**\n    Now, use the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ to find $v_{max}$.\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    Square both sides:\n    $\\gamma_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for $v_{max}^2/c^2$:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}}$\n\n8.  **Substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$.**\n    Substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$ from step 6 into the equation from step 7:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n9.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    The derived formula matches option B.\n\n    *   A) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$\n    *   B) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n    *   C) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ (This is the non-relativistic, or classical, limit)\n    *   D) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
