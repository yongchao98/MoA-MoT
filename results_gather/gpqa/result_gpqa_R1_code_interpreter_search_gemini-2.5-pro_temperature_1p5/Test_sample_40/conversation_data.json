    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principle:** This problem involves the speed of light in a moving medium as observed from a stationary frame. This is a classic application of the Einstein velocity addition formula from the theory of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Define the frames of reference:**\n    *   Let **S** be the laboratory frame (the observer's frame).\n    *   Let **S'** be the rest frame of the moving glass block.\n\n3.  **Identify the velocities:**\n    *   **v**: The velocity of the glass block (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S). The problem states the glass moves in the same direction as the light beam.\n    *   **u'**: The velocity of the light beam relative to the glass (frame S'). In a medium with refractive index *n*, the speed of light is `c/n`. Since the problem sets `c=1`, the speed of light within the glass, as measured in the glass's own rest frame, is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   **u**: The velocity of the light beam relative to the laboratory (frame S). This is the quantity we need to find.\n\n4.  **Recall the relativistic velocity addition formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities in the same direction in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n5.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    We have:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these into the formula gives:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\n6.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To clear the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by *n*:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The derived expression for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n\n    Let's check the options:\n    A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    C) 1\n    D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n    Our result matches option D.\n\nThis effect is known as the Fizeau effect, and this relativistic formula correctly describes the experimental observations.\n\n<<<D>>>"
