    "**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The user wants to know which fundamental symmetries must be respected by *all* operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model that includes higher-dimensional operators to parametrize the effects of new physics at some high-energy scale.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each symmetry:**\n    *   **1. Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in all known physics, forming the basis of special relativity and quantum field theory (QFT). SMEFT, being a QFT, is built on the principle of Lorentz invariance. All terms in the Lagrangian, including the higher-dimensional operators, are constructed to be Lorentz scalars, meaning they are invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n    *   **2. Poincare Symmetry:** Poincare symmetry is the full symmetry of spacetime in special relativity. It includes Lorentz transformations plus spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, it is a foundational pillar of QFT. SMEFT operators are constructed to be invariant under Poincare transformations to ensure that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers, regardless of their position in spacetime. Therefore, Poincare symmetry must be respected.\n    *   **3. CP Symmetry:** CP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity inversion (P). The Standard Model itself is known to violate CP symmetry in the weak sector, which is responsible for the matter-antimatter asymmetry observed in the universe. SMEFT is designed to parametrize potential deviations from the Standard Model, including new sources of CP violation. Therefore, SMEFT operators are explicitly *not* required to respect CP symmetry. Some operators will conserve it, but many are constructed to violate it.\n    *   **4. CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant QFT with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of C, P, and T (time reversal). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local, Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it must obey the CPT theorem. All operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be CPT-invariant.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the results:**\n    *   Lorentz symmetry is required. (Statement 1 is correct)\n    *   Poincare symmetry is required. (Statement 2 is correct)\n    *   CP symmetry is *not* required. (Statement 3 is incorrect)\n    *   CPT symmetry is required, as a consequence of Lorentz invariance and locality. (Statement 4 is correct)\n\n4.  **Match with the given options:** The correct statements are 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option A.\n\n    *   A) 1, 2, 4 - Correct.\n    *   B) 1, 3, 4 - Incorrect because it includes CP symmetry.\n    *   C) 3, 4 - Incorrect because it includes CP symmetry and omits the fundamental spacetime symmetries.\n    *   D) 1, 2 - Incorrect because it omits CPT symmetry, which is a necessary consequence of the other assumed symmetries.\n\n<<<A>>>"
