    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the chemical equilibrium:**\n    The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the following equilibrium reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\n    The problem provides a solution of the complex, so we should consider its dissociation:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Write the formation constant expression:**\n    The formation constant, $K_f$ (also given as KCa-EDTA), is defined for the formation reaction:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium):**\n    Let 'x' be the change in concentration as the complex dissociates to reach equilibrium.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\n    The term \"ideal pH\" implies that we don't need to worry about the different protonated forms of EDTA. We can assume all the free EDTA is in the $EDTA^{4-}$ form, which simplifies the calculation significantly.\n\n4.  **Substitute equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:**\n    We are given $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplify the equation:**\n    The formation constant ($K_f$) is a very large number ($5 \\times 10^{10}$). This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex, meaning very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be a very small value compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M).\n    We can make the following approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Solve for x:**\n    Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for 'x', which represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$.\n    $x^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    So, the concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated value $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M matches option D.\n\nLet's confirm the calculation using a python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10  # Formation constant for Ca-EDTA\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # Initial concentration of the complex in M\n\n# The equilibrium expression is K_f = (0.02 - x) / x^2\n# Since K_f is very large, x is very small, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n# The equation becomes K_f ≈ 0.02 / x^2\n# Rearranging for x^2 gives x^2 = 0.02 / K_f\n\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# x represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca^2+ ions\nprint(f\"The concentration of Ca^2+ ions is: {x:.2e} M\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The thinking process and calculation steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction and equilibrium.**\n    The problem starts with a solution of the calcium-EDTA complex, [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻. This complex will dissociate to a small extent to reach equilibrium. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻  ⇌  Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Use the given formation constant (K_f).**\n    The problem provides the formation constant, K_f (also written as KCa-EDTA), which corresponds to the formation reaction:\n    Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻\n    The expression for K_f is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    We can use an ICE table to determine the equilibrium concentrations of all species. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms when the complex dissociates. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation reaction, the concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ formed will also be 'x', and the concentration of the complex will decrease by 'x'.\n\n| Species             | Initial Concentration (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium Concentration (M) |\n| :------------------ | :------------------------ | :--------- | :---------------------------- |\n| [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻        | 0.02                      | -x         | 0.02 - x                      |\n| Ca²⁺                | 0                         | +x         | x                             |\n| EDTA⁴⁻              | 0                         | +x         | x                             |\n\n4.  **Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the K_f expression.**\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplify the equation using an approximation.**\n    The value of K_f is extremely large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), which means the equilibrium strongly favors the complex form. Therefore, very little of the complex will dissociate, and the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the approximation that `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`.\n\n    The simplified equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Solve for x.**\n    Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for 'x', which represents the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺].\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    The calculation confirms that x ($6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$) is indeed much smaller than 0.02, so our approximation was valid. The code execution also provided this result.\n\n7.  **Match the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated concentration of Ca²⁺ ions is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
