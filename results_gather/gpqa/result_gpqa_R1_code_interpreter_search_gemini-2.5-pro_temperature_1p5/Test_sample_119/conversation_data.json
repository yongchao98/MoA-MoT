    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define Parallax and its relation to Distance:**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    This implies that `d = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Assumption of Uniform Distribution:**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, `ρ` (the number of stars per unit volume), is a constant value throughout space.\n    `ρ = constant`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Number of Stars in a Volume Shell:**\n    Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space at a distance `d` from the observer, with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this spherical shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness.\n    *   Surface area of a sphere of radius `d` is `4πd²`.\n    *   So, the volume of the shell is `dV = 4πd² dd`.\n\n    The number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the number density (`ρ`) multiplied by the volume of the shell (`dV`):\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n\n4.  **Express the Number of Stars in terms of Parallax:**\n    We want to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) changes with parallax (`plx`). To do this, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   From step 1, we have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find the differential `dd` in terms of `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n        Therefore, `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    Now, let's substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN` from step 3:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * [- (1/plx²) d(plx)]`\n\n    Simplifying this equation gives:\n    `dN = - 4πρ / plx⁴ d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax Range:**\n    The quantity `dN/d(plx)` represents the number of stars per unit range of parallax.\n    `dN/d(plx) = - 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n    Since we are interested in the number count, we look at the magnitude, which ignores the negative sign (the sign simply indicates that as parallax increases, the shell moves closer, but the number of stars in a given parallax interval is positive).\n    `|dN/d(plx)| = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Determine the Proportionality:**\n    The term `4πρ` is a constant because `ρ` (the density of stars) is assumed to be constant. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n    `|dN/d(plx)| ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
