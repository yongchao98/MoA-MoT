    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial State and the Hypothetical Change\n\nFirst, we need to identify the sources of solar neutrinos in the specified energy bands under normal conditions. The question focuses on two energy bands:\n*   **Band 1:** 700 keV to 800 keV (0.7 - 0.8 MeV)\n*   **Band 2:** 800 keV to 900 keV (0.8 - 0.9 MeV)\n\nThe main neutrino-producing reactions in the Sun are from the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle. Let's analyze their contributions to these bands:\n\n*   **pp-I neutrinos (`p+p`)**: Continuous spectrum with a maximum energy of 420 keV. They do **not** contribute to either band.\n*   **pp-II neutrinos (`7Be`)**: Produces a mono-energetic line at **861 keV** (and a much weaker one at 384 keV). The 861 keV line falls squarely in **Band 2**. This is a very strong source.\n*   **pp-III neutrinos (`8B`)**: Produces a continuous spectrum up to about 15 MeV. It contributes a background flux to **both Band 1 and Band 2**.\n*   **CNO cycle neutrinos (`13N`, `15O`)**: Produce continuous spectra that extend up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively. They also contribute a background flux to **both Band 1 and Band 2**.\n\nThe hypothetical scenario is that the **pp-III branch stops**. This means the reaction `7Be + p -> 8B + γ` ceases, and consequently, the production of `8B` neutrinos stops. All other reactions, including the pp-I, pp-II, and CNO cycles, continue as they were.\n\n### 2. Determine the Neutrino Fluxes After the Change\n\nAfter the pp-III branch stops, the `8B` neutrino flux becomes zero. The remaining sources in our energy bands are:\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV)**: The only remaining source is the continuous spectrum from CNO neutrinos.\n    *   Flux(band 1) = Flux_CNO(700-800 keV)\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV)**: The remaining sources are the `7Be` line and the CNO continuum.\n    *   Flux(band 2) = Flux_7Be(at 861 keV) + Flux_CNO(800-900 keV)\n\n### 3. Estimate the Ratio of the Fluxes\n\nThe question asks for the ratio: Flux(band 1) / Flux(band 2).\nBased on our analysis, this is:\n\nRatio = [Flux_CNO(700-800 keV)] / [Flux_7Be(at 861 keV) + Flux_CNO(800-900 keV)]\n\nNow we need to compare the magnitudes of these fluxes:\n*   **Flux_7Be**: The `7Be` line is one of the most dominant features of the solar neutrino spectrum. Its total flux is very large (about 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos per cm² per second).\n*   **Flux_CNO**: The CNO cycle contributes only about 1% of the Sun's energy, and its neutrino flux is significantly smaller than the `7Be` flux. Furthermore, this flux is spread over a wide energy range. The portion of the CNO flux in a narrow 100 keV band is very small compared to the total flux of the `7Be` line.\n\nTherefore, in the denominator, the `7Be` flux vastly outweighs the CNO flux:\nFlux_7Be >> Flux_CNO(800-900 keV).\n\nSo, the ratio can be approximated as:\n\nRatio ≈ Flux_CNO(700-800 keV) / Flux_7Be(at 861 keV)\n\n### 4. Quantify the Ratio Using Experimental Data\n\nA direct calculation using theoretical flux models is complicated because it involves comparing an integrated continuum flux with a monoenergetic line flux. A more robust approach is to use the results from experiments that have measured these fluxes, such as the Borexino experiment. These experiments measure event rates, which are directly proportional to the fluxes.\n\nLet's use the published results from Borexino as a reliable guide for the relative event rates:\n\n*   **Rate from `7Be` line**: The event rate from the 861 keV `7Be` neutrino line is measured to be approximately **46 counts per day per 100 tons** of detector material (cpd/100t). This corresponds to Flux(band 2).\n*   **Rate from CNO neutrinos**: The event rate from CNO neutrinos is much lower. From the Borexino spectrum, the differential rate in the region around 750 keV is about **5 cpd/100t per MeV** of energy. To find the rate in our 100 keV wide Band 1 (800 keV - 700 keV = 100 keV = 0.1 MeV), we multiply by the bandwidth:\n    Rate(band 1) ≈ (5 cpd/100t/MeV) * (0.1 MeV) = **0.5 cpd/100t**.\n\nNow we can calculate the ratio of the rates (and thus, fluxes):\n\nRatio = Rate(band 1) / Rate(band 2) ≈ 0.5 / 46 ≈ 0.0108\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.01. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 1.\nB) 0.01 (10⁻²)\nC) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\nD) 10.\n\nThe value 0.01 is the best match.\n\n<<<B>>>"
