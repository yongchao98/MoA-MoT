    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Observations:**\n    *   **Compound:** A small, chemically synthesized peptide. Peptides are made of amino acids, which (except for glycine) are chiral. Chemical synthesis can sometimes lead to stereochemical impurities.\n    *   **1H NMR:**\n        *   A specific alpha-proton shows up as two distinct peaks.\n        *   The integrals are ~1:1, and their sum is 1H. This means there are two different molecular species in a roughly 50/50 mixture, and each species contains that alpha-proton but in a slightly different chemical environment.\n        *   Spin-spin coupling is ruled out, so the splitting isn't from an adjacent proton. This confirms the two peaks come from two different species.\n    *   **LC-MS:**\n        *   Two separate peaks are seen in the liquid chromatography (LC). This means the two species have different physical properties, allowing them to be separated.\n        *   The separation occurs even at elevated temperatures, suggesting the two species are stable isomers, not just conformers (like rotamers) that might interconvert quickly.\n        *   Both LC peaks have the *same mass spectrum*. This is a crucial piece of information. It means both species have the same molecular formula and mass as the expected product. They are isomers.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Options Based on the Evidence:**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis would almost certainly have a different molecular weight. Since the MS data shows both peaks have the same mass as the final product, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They occur when a molecule has two or more chiral centers, and the configuration is different at only some, but not all, of them. For example, if you were trying to make an L-Ala-L-Phe peptide, but some of the L-Phe racemized to D-Phe during synthesis, you would end up with a mixture of L-Ala-L-Phe and L-Ala-D-Phe. These two molecules are diastereoisomers.\n        *   **Fit with NMR:** Diastereoisomers are chemically distinct molecules and will have different NMR spectra. Corresponding protons (like the alpha-proton) will have different chemical shifts. If racemization at one chiral center was about 50%, you would expect a ~1:1 mixture, leading to two peaks of equal intensity. This perfectly matches the NMR data.\n        *   **Fit with LC-MS:** Diastereoisomers have different physical properties (like polarity, shape, etc.) and can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. They have the same molecular formula, so they would have identical mass spectra. This perfectly matches the LC-MS data.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. For example, the L-Ala-L-Phe and D-Ala-D-Phe peptides are enantiomers.\n        *   **Fit with NMR:** In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They have identical physical properties and give the exact same NMR spectrum (i.e., one set of peaks). You would only see the two alpha-protons if you used a special chiral NMR solvent or additive. Since this is not mentioned, this observation contradicts the NMR data.\n        *   **Fit with LC-MS:** Enantiomers cannot be separated by standard (achiral) LC. They would elute as a single peak. This contradicts the LC data. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would imply that an extra amino acid was added, for instance, coupling two amino acids where only one was intended. This would create a product with a significantly different (higher) mass. Since the MS data shows the mass is that of the *expected* molecule, this option is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only explanation that fits all the experimental observations—two NMR peaks for a single proton, two separable peaks by LC, and identical mass for both species—is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. This is a common issue in chemical peptide synthesis where racemization can occur at one of the chiral centers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
