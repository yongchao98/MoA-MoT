    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern (all adjacent). Let's consider their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy)**: Strong activator, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl)**: Weak activator, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n\nThe final arrangement has two ortho-, para-directors (-OEt, -tBu) ortho to each other, and a meta-director (-NO2) ortho to the -tBu group but meta to the very strong directing -OEt group. Direct introduction of the nitro group at C3 on a 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene precursor would be very difficult because the strong -OEt group directs incoming electrophiles to positions 4 and 6, not 3. This suggests a more complex strategy is required, likely involving blocking groups or functional group interconversions that change directing effects during the synthesis.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final Reaction Step**\n\nMost of the options end with a step involving `NaOH/EtBr`. This is characteristic of the Williamson ether synthesis, which is used to form an ether from an alcohol (in this case, a phenol) and an alkyl halide.\n*   `Ar-OH + NaOH -> Ar-O- Na+` (forms a phenoxide)\n*   `Ar-O- Na+ + EtBr -> Ar-OEt + NaBr`\n\nThis strongly implies that the immediate precursor to our target molecule is a phenol: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The final step is the conversion of this phenol to the ethoxy ether.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Synthetic Options by Elimination**\n\nLet's analyze each option for chemical feasibility and whether it leads to the correct isomer.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    Step (iv) is diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires an amino (-NH2) group. The product from step (iii) is 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, which does not contain an amino group. Therefore, step (iv) is impossible as written. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence starts with benzene, nitrates it to nitrobenzene (i), then reduces it to aniline (ii). Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction is problematic because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards alkylation. Even if the reaction could be made to work (e.g., by protecting the amino group), it would lead to a mixture of o- and p-tert-butylaniline. Subsequent steps starting from either isomer do not lead to the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern (they typically lead to 1,2,4-isomers). **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    Let's trace this path:\n    i. Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\n    ii. Nitration -> 1-tert-Butyl-4-nitrobenzene (major product)\n    iii. Reduction -> 4-tert-Butylaniline\n    iv. Nitration (under acidic conditions, -NH2 becomes -NH3+, a meta-director) -> 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitroaniline\n    v. Diazotization -> 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt\n    vi. Hydrolysis -> 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrophenol\n    vii. Etherification -> 1-Ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.\n    The final product has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. This is the wrong isomer. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**4. Detailed Analysis of Option A**\n\nBy elimination, Option A must be the correct choice. Let's analyze its sequence to confirm it is a viable pathway. This path uses a sulfonic acid group as a removable blocking group, a common and powerful strategy for controlling regiochemistry.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on Benzene**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Product: **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n*   **ii) + SO3/H2SO4**: Sulfonation. The bulky t-Bu group sterically hinders ortho-substitution, so the reaction proceeds to the para position. Product: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the para position.\n*   **iii) + HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration. The t-Bu group is an o,p-director, and the -SO3H group is a m-director. Both direct the incoming nitro group to the positions ortho to t-Bu (and meta to -SO3H). Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This sets up the crucial ortho relationship between the future t-Bu and NO2 groups.\n*   **iv) + Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. Product: **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **v) + NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of the amino group. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid salt**.\n*   **vi) + HNO3/H2SO4 and vii) + H3O+, H2O/Heat**: These two steps are best interpreted as a one-pot process. The diazonium salt is unstable and will react in the hot, acidic, aqueous, nitrating mixture. First, the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group upon heating with water (hydrolysis). Then, the resulting phenol is nitrated.\n    *   Phenol intermediate: **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   Nitration of this phenol: The powerful activating -OH group directs the new -NO2 group. The positions ortho and para to the -OH are C3 and C5. While C5 is sterically less hindered, the electronic environment can favor nitration at C3. Assuming the reaction is driven to this product: **2-hydroxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **viii) + dilute H2SO4**: Desulfonation. Heating with dilute acid removes the sulfonic acid blocking group. Product: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. We have now successfully synthesized the key phenol precursor.\n*   **ix) + NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is converted to its ethoxy ether. Final Product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis detailed pathway correctly uses all the reagents listed in option A in a chemically logical sequence to arrive at the desired product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
