    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Initial Information**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to understand the basic structure.\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (14/2) = 11 - 7 = 4.\n*   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring. All the given options are derivatives of benzene, which is consistent with this.\n*   The problem states there is a 1:1 mixture of two of these compounds.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data - Aromatic Region**\n\n*   **Signals:** Two singlets around 6.7 ppm.\n*   **Ratio:** 1:1.\n*   **Interpretation:** Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, a 1:1 signal ratio means that the number of protons creating the first singlet is equal to the number of protons creating the second singlet. Each compound must contribute one singlet in the aromatic region, and each of these singlets must correspond to the same number of protons.\n\nLet's predict the aromatic signals for each candidate compound:\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical. The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** corresponding to **2H**.\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry through C2 and C5. The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** corresponding to **2H**.\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2-C3 and C5-C6. The protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. Although they are adjacent, chemically equivalent protons do not split each other in a first-order spectrum, so they appear as a single **singlet** corresponding to **2H**.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent and will appear as a single **singlet** corresponding to **4H**.\n\nA mixture of any of the tetramethylbenzene isomers (all 2H) with 1,4-diethylbenzene (4H) would give an aromatic signal ratio of 2:4 or 1:2. This contradicts the observed 1:1 ratio. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is not present in the mixture**, which eliminates option **D**.\n\nThe mixture must contain two different tetramethylbenzene isomers. Any pair of them will have different chemical environments for their aromatic protons, leading to two distinct singlets. Since both singlets come from 2H, their integration ratio will be 1:1, matching the data.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Data - Aliphatic Region**\n\n*   **Signals:** Three singlets around 2.2 ppm.\n*   **Ratio:** 2:1:1.\n*   **Interpretation:** The signals are from the methyl (-CH3) groups.\n    *   Each tetramethylbenzene isomer has 4 methyl groups, totaling 12 protons.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, there are 12 + 12 = 24 aliphatic protons in total.\n    *   The ratio is 2:1:1. The sum of the ratio parts is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n    *   We can calculate the number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   So, the combination of the two isomers must produce three singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's predict the aliphatic signals for each remaining candidate:\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are equivalent. It will show **one singlet for 12H**.\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** Due to a plane of symmetry, there are two sets of equivalent methyl groups (the inner two and the outer two). It will show **two singlets, each for 6H**.\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Due to a plane of symmetry, there are three sets of chemically different methyl groups. It will show **three singlets for 6H, 3H, and 3H**.\n\n**4. Identify the Correct Pair**\n\nNow we must find which pair of compounds, when mixed, gives the required set of signals {12H singlet, 6H singlet, 6H singlet}. We do this by combining the predicted signals from each compound in the pair.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: one 12H singlet, two 6H singlets.\n    *   This gives a total of three signals with an integration ratio of 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: three 6H singlets and two 3H singlets. This would give five signals (or fewer if there is accidental overlap), which does not match the \"three signals\" described.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: one 12H singlet, one 6H singlet, and two 3H singlets. This would give four signals, not three.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only combination that produces an aliphatic spectrum with three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
