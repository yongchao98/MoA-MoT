    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity. A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of a single enantiomer (indicated by R/S descriptors) or the absence of any symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) indicates chirality and thus optical activity.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule contains a double bond, giving rise to (E/Z) isomerism, but it lacks any chiral centers (an sp3 carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule also does not possess axial or planar chirality. The plane of the double bond acts as a plane of symmetry for the molecule if we consider the conformations of the ethyl group. More rigorously, any conformation will have a superimposable mirror image.\n    *   Thus, it is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The key information is in the stereochemical descriptors: `(3aR,7aS,E)`.\n    *   The `(3aR,7aS)` part specifies the absolute configuration at two bridgehead stereocenters, C-3a and C-7a. The presence of specific R/S descriptors for a single molecule indicates that we are dealing with a single enantiomer, not a racemic mixture.\n    *   For a molecule with multiple stereocenters to be achiral (a meso compound), the stereocenters must be related by an internal symmetry element, which would typically require them to have opposite configurations (e.g., R and S) and be structurally equivalent. Here, C-3a and C-7a are not structurally equivalent in the isobenzofuran ring system.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is chiral. Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (-H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other chiral carbon group).\n    *   The specific isomer is `(2R,3S)`. When the two stereocenters have opposite configurations (R,S) in a molecule with this type of symmetry, we must check for a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Drawing the molecule, for example, in a Fischer projection or a staggered conformation, reveals a plane of symmetry that lies between C2 and C3.\n    *   A molecule with stereocenters but also an internal plane of symmetry is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The stereocenters have the `(2R,3R)` configuration.\n    *   This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable. This pair constitutes a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   Since the name specifies a single enantiomer `(2R,3R)`, it is a chiral substance and is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (C3=C4) and a hydroxyl group on C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the ring path `-C2H2-C3H=`, and the other ring path `-C6H2-C5H2-`. Because the paths around the ring are different due to the location of the double bond, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   A molecule containing only one stereocenter is always chiral.\n    *   The `(R)` designation indicates a specific enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups in a 1,3,5-relationship. The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` typically refers to the highly symmetric, all-`cis` isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring.\n    *   In its stable chair conformation, all three -OH groups would be in equatorial positions.\n    *   This molecule possesses a C3 axis of rotation and three vertical planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the CH2 group opposite to it.\n    *   Due to the presence of these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral. It's a meso-like compound where the potential stereocenters (C1, C3, C5) are actually prochiral because the two ring pathways from each carbon are identical.\n    *   Thus, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The IUPAC name describes a butan-1-one parent structure. This is a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. `C4-C3-C2-C1(=O)-`.\n    *   Substituents are a cyclopentyl group at C1 and a methyl group at C3.\n    *   Assembling the structure gives: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   Let's check this molecule for chiral centers. C3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a C4-methyl group, a C3-substituent methyl group, and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. The two methyl groups attached to C3 make it not a chiral center.\n    *   Let's re-examine the structure. The molecule is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the cyclopentyl ring and contains the C=O group, the C2(H2) group, and the C3(H) atom of the chain.\n    *   Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **not optically active**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
