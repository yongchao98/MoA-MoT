    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**1. Determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant.**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Parent structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene`. This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **Principal functional group:** `carboxylic acid` (-COOH). This group is at position 1.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   `2-formyl`: An aldehyde group (-CHO) at position 2.\n    *   `5-vinyl`: A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) at position 5.\n\nLet's draw the structure to determine its molecular formula:\nThe structure contains:\n*   A 6-carbon ring.\n*   A 1-carbon carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   A 1-carbon formyl group (-CHO).\n*   A 2-carbon vinyl group (-CH=CH₂).\n\nCounting the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (in the ring) + 1 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) + 2 (in -CH=CH₂) = **10 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** Let's count them based on the structure.\n    *   Ring carbons: C1(1H), C2(1H), C3(1H), C4(1H), C5(1H), C6(2H) = 7H\n    *   Functional groups: -COOH(1H), -CHO(1H), -CH=CH₂(3H) = 5H\n    *   Total H = 7 + 5 = **12 hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) = **3 oxygens**.\n\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the reactant.**\n\nThe IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) can be calculated from the molecular formula using the formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n(Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 11 - 6 = **5**.\n\nAlternatively, we can count the rings and pi (π) bonds from the structure:\n*   One ring = 1\n*   One C=C bond in the ring = 1\n*   One C=C bond in the vinyl group = 1\n*   One C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group = 1\n*   One C=O bond in the formyl group = 1\n*   Total IHD = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5**. This confirms our molecular formula is correct.\n\n**3. Understand the reaction and identify the product.**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent. Its effect is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) structures.\n\nHere's how it affects the reactant:\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond (hydrogenated).\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group is reduced, converting the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) to an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n*   The ring structure itself remains intact.\n\nThe reaction removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all double bonds. The product will be a saturated hydrocarbon with the same carbon skeleton as the reactant.\n\n**4. Determine the structure and molecular formula of the product.**\n\n*   **Carbon Skeleton:** The reactant has 10 carbon atoms. This is unchanged. The product is a **C₁₀** hydrocarbon.\n*   **Saturation:** All double bonds (C=C and C=O) are reduced. The product is fully saturated.\n*   **Rings:** The reactant has one ring. This ring is not broken during the reaction. The product has **one ring**.\n\nThe product is a **saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon** (specifically, a substituted cyclohexane). The general formula for a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\nSince our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula will be **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n\nWe can calculate the IHD for the product (C₁₀H₂₀) using the formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nAlternatively, we know the IHD is the sum of rings and π bonds in the structure.\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of π bonds = 0 (the product is saturated)\n*   Total IHD = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods give the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   Reactant IHD = 5.\n*   The reaction reduces 4 π bonds (C=C in ring, C=C in vinyl, C=O in COOH, C=O in CHO).\n*   Change in IHD = -4.\n*   Product IHD = Reactant IHD + Change = 5 - 4 = 1.\nThis confirms the result.\n\nComparing with the options:\nA) 3\nB) 5\nC) 0\nD) 1\n\nThe calculated IHD is 1, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
