    "*   **Thinking Process**\n\n    1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n        *   We have two astronauts with different masses and relativistic speeds moving in the same direction.\n        *   We need to calculate two quantities:\n            1.  The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between them.\n            2.  The total energy ($E_{total}$) of the system.\n\n    2.  **Identify Relevant Physics Principles:**\n        *   **Relativistic Velocity Addition/Subtraction:** Since the speeds are relativistic (a significant fraction of the speed of light, c), we cannot simply subtract the speeds ($0.6c - 0.5c$). We must use the Lorentz transformation for velocities. The formula for the relative velocity ($v_{rel}$) between two objects moving in the same direction with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$ (as measured from a stationary frame) is:\n            $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n        *   **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ and velocity $v$ is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n        *   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor is defined as:\n            $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n        *   **Total Energy of a System:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts. It is an additive scalar quantity.\n            $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$\n\n    3.  **Define Variables from the Question:**\n        *   Mass of astronaut 1: $m_1 = 2m$\n        *   Speed of astronaut 1: $v_1 = 0.6c$\n        *   Mass of astronaut 2: $m_2 = 3m$\n        *   Speed of astronaut 2: $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\n    4.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n        *   **Calculate Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$):**\n            *   Plug the values of $v_1$ and $v_2$ into the velocity subtraction formula.\n            *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n            *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n            *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n            *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n            *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428... c$\n            *   So, $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n\n        *   **Calculate Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n            *   First, calculate the energy of astronaut 1 ($E_1$). This requires his Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1$.\n                *   $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (\\frac{v_1}{c})^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n                *   $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n            *   Next, calculate the energy of astronaut 2 ($E_2$).

    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe need to find two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\n*   The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between them.\n*   The total energy ($E_{total}$) of the system.\n\n**2. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nSince the astronauts are moving at speeds that are a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. We cannot simply subtract the speeds.\n\nLet the lab frame be $S$.\nThe velocity of the first astronaut (mass 2m) is $v_1 = 0.6c$.\nThe velocity of the second astronaut (mass 3m) is $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n\nThe formula for relative velocity between two objects moving in the same direction is:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $m_0$ is the rest mass and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts:\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = \\gamma_1 (m_1) c^2 + \\gamma_2 (m_2) c^2$\n\n*   **Calculate energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n    *   Rest mass: $m_1 = 2m$\n    *   Velocity: $v_1 = 0.6c$\n    *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1$:\n        $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   Energy $E_1$:\n        $E_1 = (1.25) \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculate energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n    *   Rest mass: $m_2 = 3m$\n    *   Velocity: $v_2 = 0.5c$\n    *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2$:\n        $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n    *   Energy $E_2$:\n        $E_2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}) \\times (3m) \\times c^2 = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}} mc^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculate the total energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n    *   $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n    *   Using the approximation $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$:\n        $E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 2 \\times 1.732) mc^2 = (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc^2**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$ and the total energy is $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$. These values correspond to option D. The previous python code execution confirms these calculations.\n\n<<<D>>>"
