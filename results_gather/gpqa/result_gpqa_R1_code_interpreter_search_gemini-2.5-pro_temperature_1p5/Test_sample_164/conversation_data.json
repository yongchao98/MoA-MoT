    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the correct statement:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core task is to create a polymer with *regular branches* using *only ethylene* as the monomer. This is achieved by adding a second catalyst to a system that initially produces high-density (linear) polyethylene. This process is known as tandem catalysis, where the second catalyst must oligomerize ethylene into a specific alpha-olefin (e.g., 1-hexene or 1-octene), which is then incorporated as a branch by the polymerization catalyst.\n\n2.  **Analyze Statement A: \"Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.\"**\n    *   The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization of ethylene.\n    *   The most common and effective catalysts for selective ethylene oligomerization (e.g., chromium-based systems) are typically activated by aluminum-based compounds like methylaluminoxane (MAO) or modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO).\n    *   In fact, in many tandem systems, the same MAO activator is used for both the polymerization catalyst and the oligomerization catalyst.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is factually **incorrect**. Aluminum-based activators are essential and they do work.\n\n3.  **Analyze Statement B: \"Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.\"**\n    *   Noble metals (like palladium, Pd) can be used to make branched polyethylene from ethylene via a mechanism called \"chain walking\".\n    *   However, chain walking produces a hyperbranched structure with a statistical distribution of short branches (methyl, ethyl, etc.). This does not match the goal of creating a polymer with *regular branches* (i.e., branches of a uniform length, like all butyl or all hexyl branches).\n    *   So, while the statement is true in a general sense (they make branched polymers and are expensive), these catalysts are not suitable for the specific goal described. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect** in the given context.\n\n4.  **Analyze Statement D: \"One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.\"**\n    *   Group VIa (or Group 6) contains Chromium (Cr), Molybdenum (Mo), and Tungsten (W).\n    *   Chromium-based catalysts are famously effective and highly selective for the oligomerization of ethylene. Specifically, certain chromium catalysts can trimerize ethylene to 1-hexene with >99% selectivity, while others can tetramerize it to 1-octene.\n    *   Incorporating 1-hexene leads to regular butyl (C4) branches. Incorporating 1-octene leads to regular hexyl (C6) branches. This perfectly matches the objective.\n    *   These catalysts indeed require \"specific activators,\" typically aluminoxanes like MAO.\n    *   This statement accurately describes a primary method for achieving the desired chemical transformation. It is a factually **correct** chemical statement.\n\n5.  **Analyze Statement C: \"Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.\"**\n    *   Tandem catalysis systems for producing branched polyethylene from ethylene are indeed commercialized. Major chemical companies like Dow (with its INSITE™ technology platform) and technology licensors like Univation Technologies (a joint venture of Dow and ExxonMobil, with its PRODIGY™ catalyst technology) have developed and operate processes based on this principle in the US and globally.\n    *   This statement is factually **correct**.\n\n6.  **Compare the Correct Statements (C and D):** Both statements C and D appear to be correct. However, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, we must identify the *best* or most relevant answer.\n    *   Statement D describes the fundamental chemical principle—the type of catalyst that can be used to solve the researcher's specific chemical problem.\n    *   Statement C describes the industrial and commercial status of the technology.\n    *   The question originates from a scientist in a research lab trying to solve a chemical synthesis problem. Statement D provides direct, actionable chemical information that addresses the core of the problem (\"what catalyst to use?\"). Statement C provides supporting context but doesn't explain *how* to achieve the goal chemically. In a scientific context, the statement about the underlying chemical principle (D) is the most pertinent and fundamental answer.\n\n**Conclusion:** Statement A is false. Statement B is incorrect in the context of producing *regular* branches. Both C and D are factually correct, but D provides the specific chemical insight that is most relevant to the researcher's problem. Therefore, D is the best answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
