    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to follow a two-step process for each star:\n1.  **Check Visibility**: Determine if the star is observable from the Paranal Observatory.\n2.  **Check Detectability**: If the star is visible, determine if it's bright enough to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 in a 1-hour exposure.\n\n**1. Visibility from Paranal Observatory**\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. Stars are generally observable if their declination (DEC) is within a certain range. For the VLT, the operational declination limit is from +25° to -89°.\n\n*   **a) Canopus (α Carinae)**: Its declination is approximately -52°. This is well within the observable range for the VLT. **(Visible)**\n*   **b) Polaris (α Ursae Minoris)**: Its declination is approximately +89°. This is far outside the VLT's +25° northern limit. **(Not Visible)**\n*   **c), d), e), f) Hypothetical Stars**: All these stars are located at a declination of 0°. This is on the celestial equator and is easily visible from Paranal. **(Visible)**\n\nSo, out of the six stars listed, Polaris is not visible. We only need to check the detectability of the remaining five stars.\n\n**2. Detectability with ESPRESSO**\n\nA star is considered \"detectable\" if it can achieve an S/N of 10 in a 1-hour (3600s) exposure. To determine this, we need the star's apparent V magnitude (`V_mag`).\n\nThe ESPRESSO Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) is the most accurate tool for this. However, based on the provided overview and typical performance of high-resolution spectrographs on 8-meter class telescopes, a V magnitude of around 16 is the approximate limit for achieving S/N=10 in a 1-hour exposure under average conditions. Brighter stars (with a lower V magnitude) will be detectable.\n\nLet's find the apparent V magnitude for each visible star:\n\n*   **a) Canopus**: It is the second-brightest star in the night sky with an apparent V magnitude of **-0.74**. This is extremely bright and will easily achieve the required S/N. **(Detectable)**\n\n*   **c), d), e), f) Hypothetical Stars**: We need to calculate the apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) from the given absolute V magnitude (`M_V` = 15) and distance (`d`) in parsecs. We use the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V - 5 + 5 * log10(d)`.\n\n    *   **c) Distance = 10 pc**:\n        `m_V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(10) = 10 + 5 * 1 = 15`\n        A `V_mag` of 15 is bright enough to be detected. **(Detectable)**\n\n    *   **d) Distance = 200 pc**:\n        `m_V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(200) ≈ 10 + 5 * 2.301 = 10 + 11.505 = 21.5`\n        A `V_mag` of 21.5 is far too faint for ESPRESSO to achieve the required S/N in one hour. **(Not Detectable)**\n\n    *   **e) Distance = 5 pc**:\n        `m_V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 10 + 5 * 0.699 = 10 + 3.495 = 13.5`\n        A `V_mag` of 13.5 is well within the detectable range. **(Detectable)**\n\n    *   **f) Distance = 50 pc**:\n        `m_V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(50) ≈ 10 + 5 * 1.699 = 10 + 8.495 = 18.5`\n        A `V_mag` of 18.5 is too faint to meet the detection criteria. **(Not Detectable)**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Star | Visible? | Detectable? |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| a) Canopus | Yes | Yes |\n| b) Polaris | No | - |\n| c) Star at 10 pc | Yes | Yes |\n| d) Star at 200 pc | Yes | No |\n| e) Star at 5 pc | Yes | Yes |\n| f) Star at 50 pc | Yes | No |\n\nThe stars that are detectable are Canopus, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc. This gives a total of 3 detectable stars.\n\n<<<A>>>"
