    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of possible products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reaction:**\n    *   The reactant is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. \"Racemic\" means it is a 50/50 mixture of its two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n    *   The structure is CH₂=CH-C*H(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃, where C* is the chiral center.\n    *   The reagent is Grubbs catalyst, which catalyzes olefin metathesis. Since only one type of alkene is present, it will undergo self-metathesis (homodimerization).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Metathesis Reaction:**\n    *   The general scheme for the self-metathesis of a terminal alkene (like R-CH=CH₂) is:\n        2 R-CH=CH₂  ⇌  R-CH=CH-R  +  CH₂=CH₂ (ethene)\n    *   In our case, R is the sec-butyl group, specifically -(C*H(CH₃)CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The question asks to exclude ethene, so we focus on the product R-CH=CH-R.\n    *   The product has the structure: (CH₃CH₂)(CH₃)C*H-CH=CH-C*H(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The IUPAC name for this structure is 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. This product contains two chiral centers (at C3 and C6) and a double bond in the middle (at C4) which can have E or Z stereochemistry.\n\n3.  **Consider the Stereochemistry of the Products:**\n    *   Since the starting material is a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) enantiomers, three types of pairings can occur during the metathesis reaction:\n        a. (R)-alkene + (R)-alkene\n        b. (S)-alkene + (S)-alkene\n        c. (R)-alkene + (S)-alkene\n\n4.  **Analyze Products from Each Pairing:**\n\n    *   **a. (R)-alkene + (R)-alkene:** This reaction combines two molecules with (R) stereocenters.\n        *   The resulting product will be (3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n        *   The double bond can be E or Z. This gives two products which are diastereomers of each other:\n            1.  (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n            2.  (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n\n    *   **b. (S)-alkene + (S)-alkene:** This reaction combines two molecules with (S) stereocenters.\n        *   The resulting product will be (3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n        *   Again, the double bond can be E or Z. These two products are the enantiomers of the products from the (R)+(R) reaction.\n            3.  (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (enantiomer of product 1)\n            4.  (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (enantiomer of product 2)\n        *   So far, we have 4 distinct products (two pairs of enantiomers).\n\n    *   **c. (R)-alkene + (S)-alkene:** This is a cross-metathesis reaction between the two enantiomers.\n        *   The resulting product will be (3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Note that naming the molecule (3S,6R) is identical due to the symmetry of the carbon chain; numbering from the opposite end gives the (3R,6S) name. Because a molecule with chiral centers is superimposable on its mirror image (e.g., (3R,6S) vs (3S,6R)), it is an achiral meso compound.\n        *   We need to consider the E/Z isomerism for this meso compound.\n            *   **(E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** This molecule has a center of inversion (i) at the midpoint of the C=C bond. A center of inversion makes a molecule achiral. So, this is a single meso product.\n            *   **(Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** This molecule, in a conformation where the C=C plane acts as a mirror, possesses a plane of symmetry. Its existence in any accessible conformation makes the molecule achiral overall. So, this is also a single meso product.\n        *   This reaction produces two distinct, achiral (meso) diastereomers:\n            5.  (E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n            6.  (Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n\n5.  **Count the Total Number of Products:**\n    The question asks for the total number of possible products, which means counting all unique stereoisomers. Let's list them:\n    1.  (E)-(3R,6R)-... (chiral)\n    2.  (E)-(3S,6S)-... (chiral, enantiomer of 1)\n    3.  (Z)-(3R,6R)-... (chiral)\n    4.  (Z)-(3S,6S)-... (chiral, enantiomer of 3)\n    5.  (E)-(3R,6S)-... (meso, achiral)\n    6.  (Z)-(3R,6S)-... (meso, achiral)\n\n    In total, there are 6 distinct chemical compounds produced in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
