    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state and the measurement basis.**\n    *   The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n    *   The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. This is the initial state of the system, let's call it $|\\psi_{initial}>$. This state is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operator $\\hat{L}^2$ and its z-component $\\hat{L}_z$. The eigenvalue of $\\hat{L}_z$ for this state is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the state corresponding to the measurement outcome.**\n    *   A measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is performed.\n    *   We want to find the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $m_1\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $m_2\\hbar$.\n    *   The desired outcome corresponds to $m_1\\hbar = -\\hbar$ (so $m_1 = -1$) and $m_2\\hbar = -\\hbar$ (so $m_2 = -1$).\n    *   The state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled state $|l_1, l_2, m_1, m_2> = |1, 1, -1, -1>$. Let's call this the final state, $|\\psi_{final}>$.\n\n3.  **Relate the initial and final states using the principles of quantum mechanics.**\n    *   The probability of measuring the outcome associated with $|\\psi_{final}>$ when the system is in the state $|\\psi_{initial}>$ is given by the squared magnitude of their inner product:\n        $P = |<\\psi_{final}|\\psi_{initial}>|^2$\n    *   Substituting the specific states:\n        $P = |<1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$\n\n4.  **Use the properties of angular momentum coupling (Clebsch-Gordan coefficients).**\n    *   The inner product $<1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which is often written as $<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>$.\n    *   A fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers equals the total magnetic quantum number. That is, the coefficient is zero unless $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n    *   Let's check this condition for our specific case:\n        *   From the final state (the measurement outcome): $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. Their sum is $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n        *   From the initial state (the system's state): $m = -1$.\n    *   Since $m_1 + m_2 \\neq m$ (i.e., $-2 \\neq -1$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n        $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1> = 0$\n\n5.  **Calculate the final probability.**\n    *   The probability is the square of this coefficient:\n        $P = 0^2 = 0$.\n\n*Alternative perspective (Conservation of $L_z$):*\nThe initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator $\\hat{L}_z = \\hat{L}_{1z} + \\hat{L}_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$.\nThe final state we are projecting onto, $|1, 1, -1, -1>$, is also an eigenstate of $\\hat{L}_z$. Its eigenvalue is $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = (-1-1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.\nSince the initial and final states are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator ($\\hat{L}_z$) but with different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$), they must be orthogonal. Their inner product is zero, and therefore the probability of measuring the system transitioning from one to the other is zero.\n\nTo confirm this, we can run a simple calculation.\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum.cg import CG\nfrom sympy import S\n\n# This script calculates the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>\n# for the given quantum numbers. The probability is the square of this coefficient.\n\n# Quantum numbers from the problem statement:\nl1 = 1\nl2 = 1\nl = 2\nm = -1\n\n# Quantum numbers for the desired measurement outcome:\nm1 = -1\nm2 = -1\n\n# Calculate the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient\n# Note: The sympy CG function takes arguments as (j1, m1, j2, m2, j, m)\ncoefficient = CG(S(l1), S(m1), S(l2), S(m2), S(l), S(m))\n\n# The doit() method evaluates the object\nvalue = coefficient.doit()\n\n# The probability is the square of the coefficient's magnitude\nprobability = value**2\n\nprint(f\"The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is: {value}\")\nprint(f\"The probability is: {probability}\")\n```\n>>>\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is: 0\nThe probability is: 0\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome on a quantum system in a given state.\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The system of two electrons is in the coupled angular momentum state $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operators $\\hat{L}^2$ and $\\hat{L}_z$. The eigenvalue of the total z-component of angular momentum, $\\hat{L}_z = \\hat{L}_{1z} + \\hat{L}_{2z}$, for this state is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Measurement Outcome State**: We want to measure the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The specific outcome we are interested in is getting eigenvalues of $-\\hbar$ for both. This corresponds to the uncoupled state $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle = |l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1, 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Probability Calculation**: In quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a system in state $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle$ to be in the state $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of their inner product:\n    $P = |\\langle \\psi_{final} | \\psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2$\n\n    Substituting the specific states:\n    $P = |\\langle 1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\n4.  **Applying Selection Rules (Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients)**: The inner product $\\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental selection rule for these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the z-components of angular momentum are conserved, meaning **$m = m_1 + m_2$**.\n\n5.  **Checking the Condition**:\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired final state, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   The sum is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (because $-1 \\neq -2$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $\\langle 1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = 0^2 = 0$\n\nThis means it is impossible to obtain the measurement outcome where both electrons have a z-component of angular momentum of $-\\hbar$ if the total system has a z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$.\n\nThe provided code output confirms this reasoning. The calculated Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is 0, which leads to a probability of 0.\n\n<<<A>>>"
