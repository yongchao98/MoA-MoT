    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction A Analysis\n\n**1. Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n*   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is the nucleophile precursor.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which will act as the electrophile.\n*   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n*   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which then attacks the Michael acceptor.\n\n**2. Enolate Formation:**\n*   The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl C=O group): C2 and C6.\n*   **C2** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-hydrogens**. Therefore, deprotonation cannot occur at C2.\n*   **C6** is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-hydrogen**.\n*   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the only available α-carbon, which is C6. This forms an enolate where the C=C double bond is between C1 and C6. The C6 carbon becomes the nucleophilic center.\n\n**3. Michael Addition Step:**\n*   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. In ethyl acrylate (CH2=CH-COOEt), the β-carbon is the CH2 group.\n*   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n*   The initial adduct is an enolate, which is then protonated during workup to yield the final product.\n\n**4. Product Structure and Naming (Product A):**\n*   **Starting Ketone:**\n    *   C1: Carbonyl group (=O)\n    *   C2: Ethyl and methyl groups\n    *   C6: Methyl group\n*   **Product Structure:** A `–CH2CH2COOEt` group (from ethyl acrylate) is now attached to the C6 position of the ketone.\n    *   C1: Carbonyl group (=O)\n    *   C2: Ethyl and methyl groups\n    *   C6: Methyl group and an ethyl propanoate group (`-CH2CH2COOEt`)\n*   **Naming:** Let's analyze the names provided in the options. The options use a naming system where the cyclohexyl ring is treated as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   Let's examine the name `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   This name implies that the main chain is `ethyl propanoate`. The `cyclohexyl` group is a substituent at position 3.\n    *   The numbering of the `cyclohexyl` substituent starts from the point of attachment (C1).\n        *   C1 is attached to the propanoate chain and has a methyl group.\n        *   C2 has an oxo group (=O).\n        *   C3 has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Let's see if the ketone that would form this product matches our starting material. To find the starting ketone, we remove the `–CH2CH2COOEt` group from C1 of the substituent and replace it with a hydrogen. The starting ketone would be `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexane`.\n    *   To get the standard IUPAC name for this ketone, we must number the ring to give the carbonyl group the lowest possible number (position 1).\n        *   The old C2 (with =O) becomes the new C1.\n        *   The old C1 becomes the new C6 (it has a methyl group).\n        *   The old C3 becomes the new C2 (it has an ethyl and a methyl group).\n    *   The IUPAC name of this starting ketone is **2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one**, which perfectly matches the reactant given in the question.\n    *   Therefore, the structure described by `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate` is the correct product A. The other name for product A, `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`, would originate from a different starting ketone and is incorrect.\n\n### Reaction B Analysis\n\n**1. Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n*   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH3CH2CH2NO2). The α-protons (on the carbon attached to the NO2 group) are acidic.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also called crotononitrile, CH3CH=CHCN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n*   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH), a strong base.\n*   This is also a **Michael Addition**.\n\n**2. Nitronate Formation:**\n*   The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, forming a nucleophilic carbanion (a nitronate anion).\n*   Nucleophile: `[CH3CH2CH-NO2]`\n\n**3. Michael Addition Step:**\n*   The α,β-unsaturated system in but-2-enenitrile is `CH3(β)-CH=CH(α)-CN`. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon (the carbon of the CH group bonded to the methyl group).\n*   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n\n**4. Product Structure and Naming (Product B):**\n*   Let's connect the fragments:\n    `[CH3CH2-CH(NO2)]–[CH(CH3)-CH2-CN]`\n*   The resulting structure is: `CH3CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n*   To name this molecule using IUPAC rules, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (-CN), which has the highest priority.\n    1.  The nitrile carbon is C1.\n    2.  The longest chain is 6 carbons long: `N≡C(1)-CH2(2)-CH(CH3)(3)-CH(NO2)(4)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)`.\n    3.  The parent chain is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    4.  The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n*   Arranging the substituents alphabetically, the final name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n*   Let's check the other name for B in the options: `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`. This molecule would have a total of 6 carbon atoms (butane chain=4C, +2 methyl groups=2C). The reaction between a C3 compound (1-nitropropane) and a C4 compound (but-2-enenitrile) must result in a product with C3 + C4 = 7 carbon atoms. Our derived product, 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile, has 7 carbons (hexane chain=6C, +1 methyl group=1C). Therefore, `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile` is incorrect due to the carbon count alone.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The product of the first reaction (A) is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The product of the second reaction (B) is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A and B**)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
