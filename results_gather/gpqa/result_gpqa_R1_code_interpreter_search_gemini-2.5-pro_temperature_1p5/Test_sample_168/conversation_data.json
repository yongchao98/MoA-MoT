    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Original Decay (Process 1)\n\n*   **Reaction:** 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V\n*   **Particles:**\n    *   A, B: Heavy nucleons. The energy released comes from the conversion of A to B. Let's call the total energy released Q_released = (2*m_A - 2*m_B)c². We assume the initial nucleons A are at rest and the final nucleons B have negligible recoil kinetic energy.\n    *   E, V: Light particles that share the released energy Q_released.\n*   **Energy Spectrum of E particles:** The problem states that the *total energy* spectrum of the two E particles (let's call it E_total(E)) is **continuous**.\n\n**Why is the spectrum continuous?**\nIn a particle decay, the released energy is distributed among the final state particles while conserving both energy and momentum.\nThe final state here effectively consists of four light particles (2E, 2V) that share the energy Q_released.\n*   Energy Conservation: Q_released = E_total(E) + E_total(V)\n    *   E_total(E) is the sum of the energies of the two E particles.\n    *   E_total(V) is the sum of the energies of the two V particles.\n\nSince the two V particles can carry away a variable amount of energy (from a minimum value up to a maximum), the energy left for the two E particles must also vary. This results in a continuous energy spectrum for E_total(E). This is a hallmark of any decay with three or more particles in the final state.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Variant Decay (Process 2)\n\n*   **Reaction:** 2A -> 2B + 2E + M\n*   **Particles:** The two V particles are replaced by a single, exotic, **massless** particle M.\n*   **Energy Release:** The initial and final nucleons (A and B) are the same, so the total energy released, Q_released, is the same as in the first process.\n\n**Is the new spectrum continuous or discrete?**\nThe final state now consists of three light particles (2E, M) that share the energy Q_released.\n*   Energy Conservation: Q_released = E_total(E) + E_M\n    *   E_M is the energy of the single M particle.\n\nSimilar to the first case, this is a three-body decay problem (ignoring the heavy B nucleons). The energy E_M that the particle M carries away can vary continuously. Consequently, the energy remaining for the two E particles, E_total(E) = Q_released - E_M, must also have a **continuous** distribution.\n\n*Conclusion so far:* The spectrum remains continuous. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n### 3. Compare the Endpoints of the Spectra\n\nThe endpoint of the E_total(E) spectrum represents the maximum possible value for the total energy of the two E particles. This maximum occurs when the *other* light particles in the final state carry away the *minimum* possible energy.\n\n*   **Endpoint for Process 1 (let's call it Q_end1):**\n    *   The \"other\" particles are the two V's.\n    *   The minimum possible energy for a system of two particles of mass m_V is their combined rest mass energy.\n    *   E_total(V)_min = 2 * m_V * c²\n    *   Therefore, the endpoint is: Q_end1 = Q_released - E_total(V)_min = Q_released - 2 * m_V * c²\n    *   The problem labels this endpoint as \"Q\". So, Q = Q_released - 2 * m_V * c².\n\n*   **Endpoint for Process 2 (let's call it Q_end2):**\n    *   The \"other\" particle is M.\n    *   The problem explicitly states that M is **massless**.\n    *   The minimum possible energy for a single massless particle is zero (it can be emitted with infinitesimally small momentum and energy).\n    *   E_M_min = 0\n    *   Therefore, the endpoint is: Q_end2 = Q_released - E_M_min = Q_released - 0 = Q_released.\n\n**Comparing the endpoints:**\n*   Q_end1 = Q_released - 2 * m_V * c²\n*   Q_end2 = Q_released\n\nThe problem describes V as a \"much lighter particle\", but crucially, it does *not* state it is massless, unlike the particle M. In physics, standard particles like the electron or neutrino (the likely real-world analogue for V) have a small but non-zero mass (m_V > 0). Therefore, the term 2 * m_V * c² is a positive value.\n\nThis means Q_end2 > Q_end1. The endpoint of the spectrum for the variant decay is higher than the endpoint for the original decay.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\n1.  **Spectrum Shape:** The spectrum remains **continuous** because the variant decay still has a multi-particle (3-body) final state, allowing for continuous energy sharing. The distribution of energy (the \"shape\") will be different because the phase space of a 2E+M final state is different from a 2E+2V final state.\n2.  **Endpoint:** The endpoint **increases** because the single massless particle M can carry away zero energy, whereas the two massive V particles must carry away at least their combined rest mass energy (2 * m_V * c²).\n\nCombining these two points, the correct description is that the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
