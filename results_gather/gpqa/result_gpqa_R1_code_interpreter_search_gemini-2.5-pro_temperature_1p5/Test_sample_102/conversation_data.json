    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It is a derivative of acetophenone (a benzene ring attached to a -COCH3 group).\n*   The substituents on the benzene ring are:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   The substituents are all *meta* to each other. This 1,3,5-trisubstitution pattern is a key feature that often requires a special synthetic strategy, as direct electrophilic substitution can be tricky.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), the existing substituents on the ring direct the position of new incoming groups.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating, ortho,para-directing.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho,para-directing.\n*   **-NHCOCH3 (acetamido):** Moderately activating, ortho,para-directing.\n*   **-NH3+ (anilinium):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing (formed from -NH2 in strong acid).\n\nA \"high-yield\" synthesis will have each step exhibiting high regioselectivity, meaning the desired isomer is formed as the major product.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Plausibility of Direct Substitution Routes**\n\nLet's consider introducing the three groups directly onto the benzene ring.\n*   **Route 1: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.**\n    1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone. (-COCH3 is m-director).\n    2.  Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 3-Nitroacetophenone. (Correct, -COCH3 directs meta).\n    3.  3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> 3-Bromo-5-nitroacetophenone. On 3-nitroacetophenone, both the -COCH3 group (at C1) and the -NO2 group (at C3) are meta-directors. They both direct an incoming electrophile to position C5. This route is regiochemically sound. However, the ring is strongly deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups, making the final bromination step very slow and requiring harsh conditions. This route is not presented as an option.\n\n*   **Route 2: Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration.**\n    1.  Benzene -> Acetophenone.\n    2.  Acetophenone -> 3-Bromoacetophenone. (-COCH3 directs meta).\n    3.  3-Bromoacetophenone -> Nitration. Here we have a conflict. The -COCH3 (at C1) is a m-director (directs to C5). The -Br (at C3) is an o,p-director (directs to C2, C4, C6). While typically the o,p-director's influence might win, a detailed analysis of the stability of the reaction intermediates (sigma complexes) shows that substitution at C5 is favored because it avoids placing a destabilizing positive charge on the carbon atom bearing the acetyl group. Thus, this route can produce 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone. The first three steps of Option D follow this path, but Option D includes four additional, nonsensical steps.\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Reactions on Deactivated Rings:** Friedel-Crafts acylation and alkylation reactions generally fail on rings substituted with strongly deactivating groups like -NO2. This is a critical constraint.\n\n**4. Analyze the Options Provided**\n\nAll options are multi-step sequences. Options A, B, C, and D all contain the reaction sequence `Fe/HCl; NaNO2/HCl; H3PO2`. This sequence is used to remove a nitro group from a ring by first reducing it to an amino group (`Fe/HCl`), then converting the amino group to a diazonium salt (`NaNO2/HCl`), and finally removing the diazonium group by reduction (`H3PO2`). This `NO2 -> NH2 -> N2+ -> H` transformation is a powerful tool to place substituents in positions that are not directly accessible, by using the directing effect of the amino group and then removing it. This strongly suggests the correct answer will use this strategy.\n\nLet's evaluate each option with this in mind.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4`\n    The first four steps convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then aniline, then a diazonium salt, and then back to benzene. This is a futile loop. The subsequent reactions on benzene would yield 4-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone, which is the wrong isomer. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    Step (i) gives bromobenzene. Step (ii) gives p-nitrobromobenzene (major). Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, so this reaction will not work in high yield. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n    As discussed, steps (i) to (iii) yield the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv) to (vii) would take this product, reduce the nitro group, re-nitrate the molecule at a different position (likely C2), and then remove the resulting amino group, leading to 3-bromo-2-nitroacetophenone, which is the wrong final product. The sequence as a whole is nonsensical. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n    This sequence uses the deamination strategy at the end. Let's trace the synthesis step-by-step:\n    1.  **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.** (Nitration)\n    2.  **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.** (Reduction)\n    3.  **iii) Aniline → p-Aminoacetophenone.** (Acylation). The notation `CH3COCl/AlCl3` is for a Friedel-Crafts acylation, which is problematic on aniline. However, in the context of multiple-choice questions, this often represents the overall transformation. p-Aminoacetophenone can be synthesized from aniline via N-acylation followed by a Fries rearrangement. We'll assume this is the intended transformation. The product is 1-(4-aminophenyl)ethanone.\n    4.  **iv) p-Aminoacetophenone → 1-(4-Amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone.** (Bromination). The substrate has a strongly activating o,p-directing -NH2 group and a deactivating m-directing -COCH3 group. Both groups direct the incoming bromine to the positions ortho to the amine and meta to the ketone (positions 3 and 5). This step is highly regioselective.\n    5.  **v) 1-(4-Amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone → 1-(4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone.** (Nitration). In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the -NH2 group is protonated to -NH3+, which is a deactivating m-director. The ring now has: -COCH3 (at C1, m-director), -Br (at C3, o,p-director), and -NH3+ (at C4, m-director).\n        *   The -COCH3 group directs to C5.\n        *   The -Br group directs to C5 (ortho).\n        *   The -NH3+ group directs to C2 and C6.\n        The powerful reinforcing alignment of the -COCH3 and -Br groups directs nitration cleanly to position C5.\n    6.  **vi) & vii) 1-(4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone → 1-(3-Bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** (Diazotization and Deamination). The amino group at C4, having served its purpose as a directing group, is now removed by diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) and reduction (`H3PO2`).\n\nThis sequence is chemically sound, with each step proceeding with high regioselectivity, thus leading to a high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDespite a minor ambiguity in the notation of step (iii), Option C describes a logical and effective synthetic strategy that utilizes a protecting/directing group (-NH2) which is later removed to achieve the desired 1,3,5 substitution pattern. The other options contain chemically infeasible steps or lead to incorrect products.\n\n<<<C>>>"
