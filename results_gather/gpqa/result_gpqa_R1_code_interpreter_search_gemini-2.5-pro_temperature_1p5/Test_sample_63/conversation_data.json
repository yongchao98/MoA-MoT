    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the reaction and products**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B. The gaseous products are passed through a series of tubes to identify and quantify them.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of this tube is equal to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   To find the moles of water: Moles = Mass / Molar Mass.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2*(1.008) + 16.00 ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂), which would form a precipitate (CaCO₃).\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change, which means no CO₂ or other acidic gases were present in the product mixture. This tells us the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO was formed, and the tube's weight increased by 0.80 g. This increase is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from molecular oxygen (O₂) or another oxygen-containing gas like nitrous oxide (N₂O).\n        *   If it was O₂, the reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol, which contains 0.05 mol of O atoms.\n        *   If it was N₂O, the reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol, which contains 0.05 mol of O atoms.\n    *   In either case, 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms were transferred to the copper.\n\n*   **Remaining gas C**\n    *   The remaining gas does not react with any of the previous reagents. Its volume is 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the products (H₂O, O-containing gas), the salts likely contain N, H, and O. A common inert gas from the decomposition of such salts is nitrogen gas (N₂). So, we can confidently assume Gas C is N₂.\n\n**2. Determine the elemental composition of the initial mixture**\n\nFrom the products, we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All N ends up as the final gas N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and the species that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (Moles of O in H₂O) + (Moles of O captured by Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet's check if the total mass of these elements matches the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 + 2.80 + 4.00 = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly. Thus, salts A and B are composed only of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. This points towards ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen oxyanions (like NO₂⁻ or NO₃⁻). Let's consider the decomposition of these salts.\n\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃(s). Its decomposition depends on temperature. At around 200°C, the main reaction is NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g). N₂O is an oxidizing gas that would react with hot copper.\n\nLet's hypothesize that A = **NH₄NO₂** and B = **NH₄NO₃**. The mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains 'n' moles of A and 'n' moles of B.\n\nLet's trace the products from this hypothetical mixture:\n*   n moles of NH₄NO₂ decomposes to: n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O.\n*   n moles of NH₄NO₃ decomposes to: n moles of N₂O and 2n moles of H₂O.\n\nThe total initial products would be:\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n moles.\n*   Gases to be passed over hot copper: n moles of N₂ (from A) and n moles of N₂O (from B).\n\nNow, let's match this to our experimental data:\n*   From H₂O: Moles of H₂O = 4n = 0.20 mol  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**.\n*   From Tube 3: n moles of N₂O react with Cu. This involves the transfer of n moles of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Moles of O captured by Cu = n = 0.05 mol. This is a perfect match.\n*   From Gas C: The N₂ gas from A (n moles) passes through unreacted. The N₂O from B reacts to form N₂ (n moles).\n    *   Total final N₂ = n (from A) + n (from B's product) = n + n = 2n.\n    *   Total moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.05 mol = 0.10 mol. This also matches perfectly.\n\nAll data are consistent with the mixture being 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two identified salts.\n\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n    *   Atoms: 2 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 2 Oxygen (O)\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n    *   Atoms: 2 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 3 Oxygen (O)\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in salts A and B:**\n    *   Total = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
