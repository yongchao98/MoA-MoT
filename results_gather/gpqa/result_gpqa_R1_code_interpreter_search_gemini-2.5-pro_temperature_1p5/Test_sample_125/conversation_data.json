    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is chiral, with a single stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), which is given as the (S) configuration.\n    *   The ketone group is at C3.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. Its reduction will create a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   The existing stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. It now has two stereocenters, at C3 and C5. Since the starting material was purely (5S), the products will be a mixture of (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   These two products are stereoisomers. To determine their relationship, we compare one to the mirror image of the other. The mirror image of (3R, 5S) is (3S, 5R). Since the second product is (3S, 5S), they are not mirror images.\n    *   Therefore, the two products are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral. It has no stereocenters.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), which reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The product, pentane-2,4-diol (CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃), has two stereocenters. The possible stereoisomers are:\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they are produced in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) are mirror images of each other, but they are superimposable due to an internal plane of symmetry. They are the same achiral compound, known as a **meso compound**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n    *   Thus, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers: a racemic mixture of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and therefore **cannot** be separated. They elute together as a single peak.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and **can** be separated.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally very different compounds (different molecular weights, formulas, and functionalities) and will be separated from each other.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have a racemic pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated. The two enantiomers will elute together. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the enantiomeric pair, one for the meso compound).\n\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\nChiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n*   Enantiomers **can** be separated.\n*   Diastereomers **can** be separated.\n*   Again, the products from Reaction I and Reaction II will be separated from each other.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have a racemic pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers from each other and also separate the meso compound from both enantiomers. This gives **3 peaks** (one for each unique stereoisomer).\n\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combined product mixture will show **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
