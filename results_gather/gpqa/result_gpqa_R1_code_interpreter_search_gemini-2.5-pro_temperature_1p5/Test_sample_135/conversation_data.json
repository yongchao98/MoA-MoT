    "This problem requires us to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f(r)`. The vector field is given by its magnitude `f(r) = 1/r^2` and its direction, which is radially outward from the origin.\n\n**Step 1: Express the vector field `f(r)` in vector form.**\nIn spherical coordinates, a vector that is purely radial can be written as `f(r) = f(r) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\nGiven the magnitude `f(r) = 1/r^2`, the vector field is:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n\n**Step 2: Identify the integral and the relevant theorem.**\nWe need to calculate the volume integral:\n`I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`\nwhere `V` is the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\nThis integral has the form required for the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume `V`.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, the volume `V` is the sphere of radius `R`, and the surface `S` is the surface of this sphere.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Divergence Theorem.**\nUsing the theorem, we can transform the volume integral into a surface integral, which is often easier to compute.\n`I = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\n**Step 4: Define the surface element `dS` and evaluate the dot product `f ⋅ dS`.**\nFor the surface of a sphere of radius `R`, the differential surface area element `dS` always points radially outward. Its vector form is:\n`dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`\nwhere `θ` is the polar angle (from 0 to π) and `φ` is the azimuthal angle (from 0 to 2π).\n\nThe vector field `f(r)` on the surface of the sphere (where `r = R`) is:\n`f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n\nNow, we compute the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n`f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat ]`\nSince `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n`f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n**Step 5: Compute the surface integral.**\nNow we integrate the result from Step 4 over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration are `θ` from 0 to π, and `φ` from 0 to 2π.\n`I = ∮_S sin(θ) dθ dφ = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nFirst, integrate with respect to `θ`:\n`∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_{0}^{π} = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nNow, integrate the result with respect to `φ`:\n`I = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} 2 dφ = [2φ]_{0}^{2π} = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\n**Alternative Consideration: Direct Calculation of Divergence**\nOne might be tempted to calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly. In spherical coordinates, for a purely radial field `f = f_r * r_hat`, the divergence is `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r`.\nHere, `f_r = 1/r^2`.\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`.\nIf the divergence is zero everywhere, the volume integral would be zero. However, this calculation is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. At the origin (`r = 0`), the vector field `f` is infinite, and its divergence is undefined. This singularity at the origin is a \"source\" of the field, and its divergence is described by a Dirac delta function, `∇ ⋅ f = 4πδ³(r)`.\nThe integral `∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV` is `4π` because the origin is contained within the volume of integration.\nThe Divergence Theorem approach is more direct as it correctly accounts for the singularity at the origin by integrating over a surface that encloses it.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBoth methods, when applied correctly, yield the same result. The value of the integral is `4π`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 1\nC) 4 π\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
