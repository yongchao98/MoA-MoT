    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical process:** The problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion (π+) into a positive muon (μ+) and a muon neutrino (νμ). The decay reaction is:\n    π+ → μ+ + νμ\n\n2.  **State the given information:**\n    *   Rest mass energy of the pion (M_pi * c²): 139.6 MeV\n    *   Rest mass energy of the muon (M_mu * c²): 105.7 MeV\n    *   The pion is stationary, which means its initial momentum is zero (p_pi = 0) and its initial total energy is its rest mass energy (E_pi = M_pi * c²).\n    *   The rest mass of the neutrino (M_nu) is assumed to be zero, which is a standard approximation in such problems.\n\n3.  **Apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum:**\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n        E_initial = E_final\n        E_pi = E_mu + E_nu\n        M_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu  (Equation 1)\n        where E_mu and E_nu are the total energies of the muon and neutrino, respectively.\n\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n        p_initial = p_final\n        0 = p_mu + p_nu\n        This implies that the muon and the neutrino move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n        |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p  (Equation 2)\n\n4.  **Use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:**\n    The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\n    E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²\n\n    *   For the muon (μ+):\n        E_mu² = (p * c)² + (M_mu * c²)²  (Equation 3)\n\n    *   For the neutrino (νμ), assuming M_nu = 0:\n        E_nu² = (p * c)² + (0)²\n        E_nu = p * c  (Equation 4)\n\n5.  **Solve the system of equations:**\n    We have a system of equations and want to find the kinetic energies (KE) of the products.\n    KE = E - mc²\n\n    *   From Equation 1, express E_mu in terms of E_nu:\n        E_mu = M_pi * c² - E_nu\n\n    *   From Equation 4, substitute p * c = E_nu into Equation 3:\n        E_mu² = E_nu² + (M_mu * c²)²\n\n    *   Now substitute the expression for E_mu into this equation:\n        (M_pi * c² - E_nu)² = E_nu² + (M_mu * c²)²\n\n    *   Expand the left side:\n        (M_pi * c²)² - 2 * (M_pi * c²) * E_nu + E_nu² = E_nu² + (M_mu * c²)²\n\n    *   The E_nu² term cancels out on both sides. Rearrange the equation to solve for E_nu:\n        (M_pi * c²)² - (M_mu * c²)² = 2 * (M_pi * c²) * E_nu\n        E_nu = [(M_pi * c²)² - (M_mu * c²)²] / [2 * (M_pi * c²)]\n\n    *   Now, let's find the total energy of the muon, E_mu, using Equation 1:\n        E_mu = M_pi * c² - E_nu\n        E_mu = M_pi * c² - {[(M_pi * c²)² - (M_mu * c²)²] / [2 * (M_pi * c²)]}\n        E_mu = [2 * (M_pi * c²)² - (M_pi * c²)² + (M_mu * c²)²] / [2 * (M_pi * c²)]\n        E_mu = [(M_pi * c²)² + (M_mu * c²)²] / [2 * (M_pi * c²)]\n\n6.  **Calculate the numerical values:**\n    To avoid intermediate rounding errors, let's use a Python script to perform the calculations based on the derived formulas.\n\n```python\n# Rest mass energies in MeV\nM_pi_c2 = 139.6\nM_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu)\nE_mu = (M_pi_c2**2 + M_mu_c2**2) / (2 * M_pi_c2)\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\n# KE = E - mc^2\nKE_mu = E_mu - M_mu_c2\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the neutrino (E_nu) from energy conservation\n# E_pi = E_mu + E_nu => E_nu = E_pi - E_mu\nE_pi = M_pi_c2\nE_nu = E_pi - E_mu\n\n# The kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu) is its total energy (since mass is assumed to be zero)\nKE_nu = E_nu\n\nprint(f\"KE of muon: {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino: {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n\n```\n>>>\nKE of muon: 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino: 29.78 MeV\n>>>\nThe calculations show that the kinetic energy of the muon (μ+) is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino (νμ) is approximately 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nC) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem involves a two-body decay of a stationary particle. To solve it, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum in the context of special relativity.\n\n**1. Identify the reaction and given values:**\n*   Decay reaction: π⁺ → μ⁺ + νμ\n*   The pion (π⁺) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass energy of pion (m_π c²): 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of muon (m_μ c²): 105.7 MeV\n*   The rest mass of the neutrino (νμ) is considered negligible (m_ν c² ≈ 0).\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before decay equals the total energy after decay. Since the pion is stationary, its initial energy is just its rest mass energy.\n    *   E_initial = m_π c²\n    *   E_final = E_μ + E_ν (where E_μ and E_ν are the total relativistic energies of the muon and neutrino)\n    *   So,  m_π c² = E_μ + E_ν  ---(1)\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before decay is zero (since the pion is stationary). Therefore, the total momentum after must also be zero. This means the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum.\n    *   p_initial = 0\n    *   p_final = p_μ + p_ν = 0\n    *   So, |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p   ---(2)\n\n**3. Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) of a particle are related by:\nE² = (pc)² + (m c²)²\n\n*   For the muon (μ⁺): E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μ c²)²\n*   For the neutrino (νμ), since m_ν ≈ 0: E_ν² = (pc)² => E_ν = pc\n\n**4. Solve for the Energies:**\nWe can now substitute E_ν = pc into the equation for the muon's energy:\n*   E_μ² = E_ν² + (m_μ c²)²\n\nFrom the energy conservation equation (1), we have E_μ = m_π c² - E_ν. Substitute this into the equation above:\n*   (m_π c² - E_ν)² = E_ν² + (m_μ c²)²\n\nExpand the left side:\n*   (m_π c²)² - 2(m_π c²)E_ν + E_ν² = E_ν² + (m_μ c²)²\n\nThe E_ν² terms cancel out. Now, solve for E_ν:\n*   (m_π c²)² - (m_μ c²)² = 2(m_π c²)E_ν\n*   E_ν = [ (m_π c²)² - (m_μ c²)² ] / [ 2(m_π c²) ]\n\n**5. Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE):**\nThe kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy (KE = E - mc²).\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    Since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy.\n    KE_ν = E_ν\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\n    First, find the muon's total energy E_μ using equation (1):\n    E_μ = m_π c² - E_ν\n    Then, its kinetic energy is:\n    KE_μ = E_μ - m_μ c²\n\nThe code executed in the thinking process performs these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nM_pi_c2 = 139.6\nM_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu)\nE_mu = (M_pi_c2**2 + M_mu_c2**2) / (2 * M_pi_c2)\n# E_mu is approx 109.82 MeV\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\nKE_mu = E_mu - M_mu_c2\n\n# Calculate the total energy/kinetic energy of the neutrino (E_nu)\nE_nu = M_pi_c2 - E_mu\n\n# The script outputs:\n# KE of muon: 4.12 MeV\n# KE of neutrino: 29.78 MeV\n```\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately **4.12 MeV** for the muon (μ⁺) and **29.8 MeV** (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino (νμ).\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nC) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
