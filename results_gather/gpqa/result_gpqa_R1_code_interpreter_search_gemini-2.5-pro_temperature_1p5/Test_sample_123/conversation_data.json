    "This problem can be solved by applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, to the process of exponential particle decay.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Particle Decay:**\n\nThe number of particles `N` that survive after a time `t` from an initial sample `N₀` is given by the exponential decay law:\n`N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n\n*   `τ_lab` is the average lifetime of the particles *in the laboratory frame*.\n\n**2. Relate Lab Frame Lifetime to Proper Lifetime (Time Dilation):**\n\nThe lifetime of a particle is longest in its own rest frame (this is called the proper lifetime, `τ₀`). For an observer in the lab frame, this lifetime appears \"dilated\" or stretched by the Lorentz factor, `γ`.\n\n*   `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n\nSubstituting this into the decay equation:\n`N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n**3. Determine the Time of Flight:**\n\nThe particles travel from the center to the inner wall of the detector, a distance `d` (the radius). Since they are ultra-relativistic, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`.\n\n*   `t = d / v ≈ d / c`\n\nSubstituting this time into the decay equation:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-(d/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\nLet's group the constants for this specific particle and detector setup: `k = d / (c * τ₀)`. The equation simplifies to:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-k / γ)`\n\n**4. Analyze the Two Scenarios:**\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   Fraction surviving, `N/N₀ = 1/3`\n\n    Plugging these values into our simplified equation:\n    `1/3 = exp(-k / 20)`\n\n    To solve for the constant `k`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -k / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -k / 20`\n    `k = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Fraction surviving, `N/N₀ = 2/3`\n    *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\n    Plugging these values in:\n    `2/3 = exp(-k / γ₂)`\n\n    Again, take the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -k / γ₂`\n    `ln(2) - ln(3) = -k / γ₂`\n    `-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -k / γ₂`\n    `ln(3/2) = k / γ₂`\n\n    Now we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = k / ln(3/2)`\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Value:**\n\nWe can substitute the expression for `k` we found in Scenario 1 into the equation for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, let's compute this value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# From our derivation: gamma_2 = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\ngamma_2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 54.19. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 40\nB) 28\nC) 68\nD) 54\n\nThe closest answer is 54.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The number of particles, N, that survive after a time, t, is described by the exponential decay law:\n`N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t/τ)`\nwhere N₀ is the initial number of particles and τ is the mean lifetime of the particle in the observer's frame (the lab frame).\n\nDue to time dilation from special relativity, the lifetime of a moving particle as measured in the lab frame (τ) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, τ₀). The relationship is given by:\n`τ = γ * τ₀`\nwhere γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nSubstituting this into the decay equation gives:\n`N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t / (γ * τ₀))`\n\nThe time `t` it takes for a particle to travel the radius of the detector, `R`, is `t = R/v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. So, `t ≈ R/c`.\n\nNow we can write the fraction of surviving particles, `N/N₀`, as:\n`N/N₀ = e^(-R / (c * γ * τ₀))`\n\nLet's analyze the two given scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n-   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n-   Fraction of surviving particles, `N/N₀ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`1/3 = e^(-R / (c * 20 * τ₀))`\n\nTo solve for the unknown term `R/(c*τ₀)`, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -R / (c * 20 * τ₀)`\n`-ln(3) = -R / (c * 20 * τ₀)`\n`ln(3) = R / (c * 20 * τ₀)`\n\nFrom this, we can find the value of the constant term `R/(c*τ₀)`:\n`R / (c * τ₀) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n-   Fraction of surviving particles, `N/N₀ = 2/3`\n-   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\nPlugging these values into the general equation:\n`2/3 = e^(-R / (c * γ₂ * τ₀))`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -R / (c * γ₂ * τ₀)`\n`ln(2) - ln(3) = -R / (c * γ₂ * τ₀)`\n`-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -R / (c * γ₂ * τ₀)`\n`ln(3/2) = R / (c * γ₂ * τ₀)`\n\nNow we can solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = (R / (c * τ₀)) / ln(3/2)`\n\nWe can now substitute the expression for `R/(c*τ₀)` that we found in Scenario 1:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n`γ₂ = (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<D>>>"
