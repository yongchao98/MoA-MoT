    "This problem requires calculating the interplanar distance `d` for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Crystal System and Parameters:**\n    *   The crystal system is rhombohedral.\n    *   The lattice parameter (given as interatomic distance for a primitive cell) is `a = 10` Angstrom.\n    *   The inter-axial angle is `α = 30°`.\n    *   The Miller indices of the plane are `(hkl) = (111)`.\n\n2.  **Find the Appropriate Formula:**\n    For a rhombohedral crystal system, the formula for the interplanar spacing `d_hkl` is:\n\n    `1/d_hkl^2 = [(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)sin^2(α) + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos^2(α) - cos(α))] / [a^2(1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α))]`\n\n    An alternative, and sometimes simpler, form of this equation is:\n\n    `1/d_hkl^2 = [(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)(1 + cos(α)) - 2(hk + kl + lh)cos(α)] / [a^2(1 - cos(α))(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n\n3.  **Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane:**\n    Let's use the second, simpler-looking formula and substitute `h=1`, `k=1`, and `l=1`.\n    *   `h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3`\n    *   `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\n    Now, substitute these values into the formula:\n    `1/d_111^2 = [3(1 + cos(α)) - 2(3)cos(α)] / [a^2(1 - cos(α))(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n    `1/d_111^2 = [3 + 3cos(α) - 6cos(α)] / [a^2(1 - cos(α))(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n    `1/d_111^2 = [3 - 3cos(α)] / [a^2(1 - cos(α))(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n    `1/d_111^2 = 3(1 - cos(α)) / [a^2(1 - cos(α))(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n\n    The `(1 - cos(α))` terms in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leading to a much simpler expression specifically for the (111) plane:\n    `1/d_111^2 = 3 / [a^2(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    Now, plug the given numerical values into the simplified formula:\n    *   `a = 10`\n    *   `α = 30°`\n    *   `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n    `1/d_111^2 = 3 / [10^2 * (1 + 2 * (√3 / 2))]`\n    `1/d_111^2 = 3 / [100 * (1 + √3)]`\n\n    To find `d_111`, we take the reciprocal and then the square root:\n    `d_111^2 = [100 * (1 + √3)] / 3`\n    `d_111 = √([100 * (1 + √3)] / 3)`\n    `d_111 = 10 * √((1 + √3) / 3)`\n\n    To get the final numerical value, I will use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\na = 10.0  # Angstrom\nalpha_deg = 30.0\n\n# Convert angle to radians for trigonometric functions\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n# Simplified formula for the d-spacing of the (111) plane\n# d_111 = a * sqrt((1 + 2*cos(alpha)) / 3) is incorrect. The formula is 1/d^2 = 3 / (a^2*(1+2cos(alpha)))\n# d_111^2 = a^2 * (1 + 2*cos(alpha)) / 3\n# d_111 = a * sqrt((1+2*cos(alpha))/3) --- Let me re-derive this again\n# My previous derivation was: d_111 = 10 * sqrt((1 + sqrt(3)) / 3). Let me follow that one.\nsqrt3 = math.sqrt(3)\nd = 10 * math.sqrt((1 + sqrt3) / 3)\n\nprint(d)\n```\n<execute_result>\n9.54303350130836\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated interplanar distance is approximately 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 9.08 Angstrom\n    *   B) 8.95 Angstrom\n    *   C) 9.54 Angstrom\n    *   D) 10.05 Angstrom\n\n    The calculated value of 9.54 Angstrom matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The interplanar distance `d` for a rhombohedral crystal is given by the formula:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk + kl + lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1 - 3\\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\nwhere `a` is the lattice constant, `α` is the interaxial angle, and `(hkl)` are the Miller indices of the plane.\n\nThe denominator can be factorized as:\n$$ a^2(1 - 3\\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\cos^3\\alpha) = a^2(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha) $$\n\nFor the (111) plane, we have `h=1`, `k=1`, and `l=1`.\n*   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3`\n\nSubstituting these into the numerator:\n`Numerator = 3sin²α + 2(3)(cos²α - cosα)`\n`= 3sin²α + 6cos²α - 6cosα`\n\nUsing the identity `sin²α = 1 - cos²α`:\n`Numerator = 3(1 - cos²α) + 6cos²α - 6cosα`\n`= 3 - 3cos²α + 6cos²α - 6cosα`\n`= 3cos²α - 6cosα + 3`\n`= 3(cos²α - 2cosα + 1)`\n`= 3(1 - cosα)²`\n\nNow, substitute the simplified numerator and the factorized denominator back into the main formula:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2}{a^2(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n\nThe term `(1 - cosα)²` cancels out, leaving a much simpler formula for the (111) plane:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   `a = 10` Angstrom\n*   `α = 30°`\n*   `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2(1 + 2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}))} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n\nTo find `d_111`, we invert the equation and take the square root:\n$$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n$$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerical value:\n*   `√3 ≈ 1.732`\n*   `1 + √3 ≈ 2.732`\n*   `(1 + √3) / 3 ≈ 0.9107`\n*   `√((1 + √3) / 3) ≈ 0.9543`\n*   `d_111 = 10 * 0.9543 ≈ 9.543` Angstrom\n\nThis value matches the provided code output and corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
