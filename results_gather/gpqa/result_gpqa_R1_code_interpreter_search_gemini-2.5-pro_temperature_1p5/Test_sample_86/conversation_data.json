    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\":** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents attached. The base formula for the ring part is C6H4.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\":** The benzene ring has 6 carbons. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\":** One of the substituents contains a C=O functional group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... as well as an aromatic-halogen bond\":** One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\nCombining these facts:\n*   One substituent is -X.\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining two carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most common and simple group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n\nSo, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n\nNow, we must consider the substitution pattern: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Options Based on the Deduced Structure:**\n\nThe general structure is a haloacetophenone. Let's predict the expected 1H NMR signals:\n*   An **acetyl group (-COCH3)** will show up as a **singlet** (since there are no adjacent protons) integrating to **3H**, typically in the chemical shift range of **δ 2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n*   The **aromatic protons** (4H on the C6H4 ring) will appear in the **δ 7.0-8.0 ppm** region. The splitting pattern will depend on the substitution (ortho, meta, or para).\n    *   **Para (1,4) substitution:** Due to the symmetry, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This results in a characteristic pattern of **two doublets**, each integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Ortho (1,2) or Meta (1,3) substitution:** These isomers lack the symmetry of the para isomer and would produce a more complex pattern with up to four distinct signals for the aromatic protons.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the typical aromatic region (δ 7-8 ppm). The signals at δ 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are incorrect for protons on a benzene ring. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** We see two doublets at δ 7.8 and 7.6, each integrating to 2H. This is the classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** We see a singlet at δ 2.3, integrating to 3H. This is a perfect match for the methyl protons of an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches the structure of **para-haloacetophenone**. The electron-withdrawing acetyl group deshields the ortho protons (making them appear further downfield, ~δ 7.8) relative to the protons ortho to the halogen.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**. While this is a carbonyl group, the problem also states there is an *aromatic-halogen bond*. A structure like p-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde would fit the carbon count and NMR signals, but the halogen would be on a methyl group (aliphatic), not the aromatic ring. Thus, this option contradicts the given information.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring. The signals at δ 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the aromatic proton region, and the integration (2H singlet for what should be a 3H methyl) is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only structure that fits all the descriptive information (8 carbons, di-substituted aromatic, carbonyl, aromatic-halogen bond) is a **para-haloacetophenone**. The NMR data in option B is the only one that correctly represents this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>"
