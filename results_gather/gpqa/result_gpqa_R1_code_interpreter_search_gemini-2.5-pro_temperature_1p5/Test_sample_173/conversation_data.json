    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** We have a nucleus of mass `M` at rest. Its rest-mass energy is given as `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial total energy is `E_initial = M*c^2` and its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`. These fragments will be moving to conserve momentum, so they will have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`, respectively.\n\n**2. Determine the Rest Masses of the Fragments and the Q-value**\n\n*   The problem states a relationship between the masses: one fragment is twice as massive as the other. We'll designate `m1` as the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`. This also means their rest-mass energies are related: `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`. In terms of energy: `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`.\n*   We can now calculate the rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (300 GeV) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Substitute `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2` into the sum: `2*m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n    *   `3*m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` => `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   The energy released as kinetic energy in the fission is called the Q-value. It's the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy.\n    *   `Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`.\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Kinetic Energy `T1` using the Classical Approximation**\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\n*   By conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: `p1 = p2`.\n*   From the kinetic energy formula, we have `p = sqrt(2mT)`.\n*   Therefore, `sqrt(2*m1*T1_classical) = sqrt(2*m2*T2_classical)`, which simplifies to `m1*T1_classical = m2*T2_classical`.\n*   Using `m1 = 2*m2`, we get `2*m2*T1_classical = m2*T2_classical`, which means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`. The less massive particle gets more kinetic energy.\n*   The total kinetic energy is `Q`: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substitute `T2_classical`: `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy `T1`**\n\n*   In relativistic mechanics, the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - m*c^2`.\n*   We can express the momentum term as `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\n*   Again, conservation of momentum means `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   Therefore: `T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2*c^2`.\n*   We know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 GeV - T1`. Let's substitute this and the mass-energy values (`m1*c^2 = 198` GeV, `m2*c^2 = 99` GeV) into the equation. For simplicity, we'll work in units of GeV.\n    *   `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n    *   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    *   `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    *   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   Now, we solve for `T1`:\n    *   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    *   `600*T1 = 603`\n    *   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   The correct relativistic kinetic energy is `T1 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\n*   The question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
