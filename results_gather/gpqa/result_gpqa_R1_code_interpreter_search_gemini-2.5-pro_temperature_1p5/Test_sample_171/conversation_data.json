    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms in different energy levels when a system is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n**1. Understand the Boltzmann Equation:**\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (`N_b`) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (`N_a`) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n`(N_b / N_a) = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_b` and `N_a` are the number of atoms in the respective energy states.\n*   `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights (or degeneracies) of the energy levels. For a specific transition in a specific atom (iron in this case), this ratio is constant.\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two states (`E_b - E_a`).\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately `1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe term \"excitation\" refers to this ratio `(N_b / N_a)`. Let's denote this ratio as `R`.\n\n**2. Set up the Equations for the Two Stars:**\n\nWe are given two stars, star_1 and star_2, with effective temperatures `T_1` and `T_2`, respectively. We can write the Boltzmann equation for the same iron transition in each star.\n\nFor star_1:\n`R_1 = (N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n\nFor star_2:\n`R_2 = (N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n**3. Use the Information from the Problem:**\n\nThe problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. This means:\n\n`R_1 = 2 * R_2`\n\nNow, we can substitute the Boltzmann expressions into this relation:\n\n`(g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [(g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n\nThe statistical weight term `(g_b / g_a)` is the same for both stars since it's the same atomic transition, so it cancels out:\n\n`exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n**4. Solve for the Relationship between T_1 and T_2:**\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides of the equation:\n\n`ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n\nUsing the logarithm properties `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`, we get:\n\n`-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n`-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)`:\n\n`ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)`\n\nFactor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_2 - 1 / T_1)`\n\nCombine the fractions inside the parentheses by finding a common denominator (`T_1 * T_2`):\n\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n**5. Substitute the Given Numerical Values:**\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference:\n`ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`\n\nThe Boltzmann constant is a fundamental physical constant:\n`k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of the term `(ΔE / k)`:\n\n`(ΔE / k) ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K`\n\nSubstituting this result back into our derived equation:\n\n`ln(2) = (1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\nThis equation is dimensionally correct, as `ln(2)` is dimensionless, and the right-hand side `(K) * (K / K^2)` is also dimensionless.\n\nThe options provided seem to have omitted the unit (K) for the `ΔE / k` factor, which is a common simplification in physics problems where the numerical value is 1. By treating the term as a dimensionless 1, the equation becomes:\n\n`ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]`\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
