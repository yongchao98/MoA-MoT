    "Here is my reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CnHm. The molar masses are approximately Ar(C) = 12 g/mol and Ar(H) = 1 g/mol.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is w(H) = (m * 1) / (n * 12 + m * 1).\n    *   We are given w(H) = 0.1428. This value is very close to 1/7 (1/7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   So, m / (12n + m) = 1/7\n    *   7m = 12n + m\n    *   6m = 12n\n    *   m = 2n\n    *   The formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   We are told Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cyclic alkane solvent is cyclohexane, C6H12. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane. For C6H12, n=6, m=12, which satisfies m=2n. This is a very strong candidate.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This implies that C and D are either saturated compounds or aromatic compounds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   Substance Z (cyclohexane) is itself a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say D = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Since hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y yields only cyclohexane, the other component, C, must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\n    *   So, C is a compound with a C6 ring skeleton that, upon hydrogenation, becomes cyclohexane.\n    *   C does not decolorize bromine water. The only common compound that fits this description is an aromatic compound. The C6 aromatic compound is benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high temperature/pressure with a catalyst like Pt), which is consistent with the problem statement.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and/or B contain carbon-carbon double or triple bonds (they are unsaturated).\n    *   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   When X is heated with platinum, it forms Y. This is described as a disproportionation reaction.\n    *   Reaction: Mixture X (A + B) --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture Y (Benzene + Cyclohexane).\n    *   Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the reaction stoichiometry must be:\n        1 A + 1 B → 1 Benzene + 1 Cyclohexane\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of mixture X also gives only substance Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that both A and B must have a C6 ring carbon skeleton, just like benzene and cyclohexane.\n    *   Let the formula of A be C6Ha and the formula of B be C6Hb.\n    *   We can now apply the principle of conservation of atoms to the reaction. Specifically, let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n        Total H in reactants = Total H in products\n        H atoms in A + H atoms in B = H atoms in Benzene + H atoms in Cyclohexane\n        a + b = 6 + 12\n        a + b = 18\n\n4.  **Answer the Question**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This corresponds to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B, which is `a + b`.\n    *   From our calculation, a + b = 18.\n\n5.  **Final Consistency Check**\n    *   Can we find plausible compounds for A and B? We need two non-conjugated, unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons such that the sum of their hydrogens is 18.\n    *   A good pair would be **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Sum of hydrogens = 10 + 8 = 18. Correct.\n    *   Both are liquids and have C6 rings.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one C=C bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two C=C bonds separated by two CH2 groups, so they are not conjugated. Both will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Hydrogenation of cyclohexene gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of 1,4-cyclohexadiene gives cyclohexane.\n    *   The reaction C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H6 + C6H12 is a known type of hydrogen transfer (disproportionation) reaction over a platinum catalyst.\n    *   All conditions of the problem are met with this model.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"
