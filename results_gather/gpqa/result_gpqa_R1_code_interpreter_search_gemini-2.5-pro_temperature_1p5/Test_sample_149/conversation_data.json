    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the given molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation. The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely from a carbonyl group (C=O), which fits with the NMR data.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a CH₂ group (n+1 rule, 2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH₂ group. The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a CH group (n+1 rule, 1+1=2 peaks). This CH is the aldehyde proton. These two signals confirm the presence of a **-CH₂-CHO** fragment (an acetaldehyde group).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region that integrates to 2 protons is characteristic of a primary amine group (**-NH₂**).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring, a -NH₂ group, and a -CH₂-CHO group.\n    *   Putting these pieces together, the structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Let's verify the molecular formula: C₆H₄ (from the ring) + C₂H₃O (from acetaldehyde group) + NH₂ = C₈H₉NO. The structure matches the formula and all NMR data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: 1. NaNO₂ + HCl; 2. H₂O**\n    1.  The first step (NaNO₂ + HCl, typically at 0-5 °C) is the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n        *   Intermediate: 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    2.  The second step is the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt by adding water and warming. The -N₂⁺ group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N₂ gas) and is replaced by an -OH group.\n        *   Product after steps 1 & 2: The amine is converted to a phenol. The molecule is now **(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    1.  The reagent is a strong base (KOH) with heat. The molecule, (4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde, has an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-hydrogens (the hydrogens on the -CH₂- group adjacent to the aldehyde). This is the classic condition for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. Subsequent protonation yields an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n        *   The addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option A).\n    3.  **Condensation (Dehydration):** The \"Heat\" specified in the reaction conditions promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The acidic α-hydrogen (on C-2) is removed, and the β-hydroxy group (on C-3) is eliminated, forming a stable, conjugated double bond between the α and β carbons.\n        *   Final Product: The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal results in **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product among the given options.**\n\n*   The final product derived from the complete reaction sequence is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n*   This matches option **C**.\n\n    *   Option A is the intermediate aldol addition product, before the heat-induced dehydration step.\n    *   Options B and D are structurally incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>"
