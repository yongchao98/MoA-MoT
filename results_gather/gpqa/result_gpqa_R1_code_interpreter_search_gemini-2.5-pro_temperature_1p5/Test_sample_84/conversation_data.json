    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe main objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet 1 and Planet 2. This ratio is expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n**2. Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the star's properties and the planet's orbit. The formula is derived from the energy balance between the stellar radiation absorbed by the planet and the thermal radiation emitted by it.\n\nThe energy absorbed by the planet per second is:\n$L_{abs} = L_{star} \\times \\frac{\\pi R_p^2}{4 \\pi a^2} \\times (1 - A)$\nwhere $L_{star}$ is the star's luminosity, $R_p$ is the planet's radius, 'a' is the semi-major axis of the orbit, and 'A' is the planet's albedo.\n\nThe energy emitted by the planet (assuming it's a black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n$L_{emitted} = (4 \\pi R_p^2) \\times \\sigma T_{eq}^4$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nBy setting $L_{abs} = L_{emitted}$ and knowing that $L_{star} = 4 \\pi R_{star}^2 \\sigma T_{star}^4$, we can solve for $T_{eq}$:\n$T_{eq}^4 = T_{star}^4 \\frac{R_{star}^2}{4a^2} (1-A)$\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left(\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}\\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\n\n**3. Determine the Temperature Ratio**\nWe need to find the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left(\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}\\right)^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left(\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}\\right)^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that the star is the same for both planets ($T_{star}$, $R_{star}$ are constant) and that the planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2}$\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2 / a_1$.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observable Quantities**\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is proportional to the star's radial velocity. The maximum shift corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, K.\n$K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\nwhere c is the speed of light.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, viewed edge-on (sin(i)≈1, which is implied by the detection via the transit method), the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and its semi-major axis (a) by:\n$K = \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} v_p = \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n$K = M_p \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{M_{star} a}}$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for 'a':\n$K^2 = M_p^2 \\frac{G}{M_{star} a} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\nUsing the formula for 'a', we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_2^2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_1^2 / (M_{star} K_1^2)} = \\frac{M_2^2}{K_2^2} \\frac{K_1^2}{M_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**6. Substitute the Given Values**\n*   **Mass Ratio**:\n    $M_1 = 7 M_{Earth}$, $M_2 = 5 M_{Earth}$\n    $\\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio**:\n    $K$ is proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda$.\n    $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å, $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, substitute these ratios back into the equation for $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n**7. Final Calculation**\nFinally, we can calculate the temperature ratio using the result from step 3:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\left(\\frac{225}{784}\\right)^{1/2}$\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nTo get the decimal value, we perform the division.\n\n```python\n# M_1 = 7 Earth masses, delta_lambda_1 = 0.03 Angstrom\n# M_2 = 5 Earth masses, delta_lambda_2 = 0.04 Angstrom\n\n# Mass ratio M2/M1\nmass_ratio = 5 / 7\n\n# RV semi-amplitude ratio K1/K2 is proportional to the Doppler shift ratio\nK_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# Ratio of semi-major axes a2/a1 = (M2/M1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na_ratio = (mass_ratio**2) * (K_ratio**2)\n\n# Ratio of equilibrium temperatures T1/T2 = (a2/a1)^(1/2)\ntemp_ratio = a_ratio**(1/2)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n\nThe calculation yields $15 / 28 \\approx 0.5357$. This value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, i.e., $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its host star and the energy it radiates into space. The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulating the Ratio:** We need to compute the ratio for the two planets:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n4.  **Simplifying the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both and cancel out. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo, so $A_1 = A_2$, and the $(1-A)^{1/4}$ term also cancels out. The equation simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n    To find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n5.  **Using Radial Velocity (RV) Data:** The problem provides information from the RV method. The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) of the star's motion is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_{star}$), and the semi-major axis (`a`). For a circular orbit, and assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_p << M_{star}$), the formula is:\n    $K = M_p \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{M_{star} \\cdot a}}$\n    (where G is the gravitational constant).\n\n6.  **Relating Semi-Major Axis to Observables:** We can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n    $K^2 = M_p^2 \\frac{G}{M_{star} \\cdot a} \\implies a = \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2}$\n\n7.  **Finding the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G \\cdot M_2^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_2^2}}{\\frac{G \\cdot M_1^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_1^2}}$\n    The terms G and $M_{star}$ are constants for both planets, so they cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_2^2 / K_2^2}{M_1^2 / K_1^2} = \\left( \\frac{M_2}{M_1} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^2$\n\n8.  **Determining the Ratios from Given Data:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:** $M_1 = 7 M_{Earth}$ and $M_2 = 5 M_{Earth}$.\n        $\\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio:** The Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity. Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes ($K$) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts.\n        $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å.\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n9.  **Calculating the Ratio $a_2 / a_1$:**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n10. **Final Calculation for Temperature Ratio:** Substitute the value of $a_2/a_1$ back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from step 4.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{225}{784} \\right)^{1/2}$\n    This simplifies to $\\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$.\n\n11. **Numerical Value:** To get the final answer, we compute the decimal value of 15/28. We can use a python script for this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given mass ratio M2/M1\nmass_ratio = 5 / 7\n\n# Given Doppler shift ratio delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n# This is equivalent to the RV semi-amplitude ratio K1/K2\nK_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# The ratio of semi-major axes a2/a1 is (M2/M1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na_ratio_2_over_1 = (mass_ratio**2) * (K_ratio**2)\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1/T_eq2 is sqrt(a2/a1)\ntemp_ratio = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_over_1)\n\n# Alternative direct calculation: (M2/M1) * (K1/K2)\n# temp_ratio_direct = (5/7) * (3/4) = 15/28\n# print(15/28)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n<<<A>>>",
