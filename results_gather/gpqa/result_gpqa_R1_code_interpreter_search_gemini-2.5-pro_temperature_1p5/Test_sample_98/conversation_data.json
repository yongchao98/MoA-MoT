    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding. The broadness is a key characteristic.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group type but does not help distinguish between the specific structures.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum. We need to find the molecule whose structure can produce both of these signals.\n\nThe multiplicity of a proton's signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (n) according to the n+1 rule. For complex splitting, a proton is coupled to multiple, different sets of neighboring protons.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means a single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to 1 adjacent proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to 2 adjacent protons (n=2), typically a CH₂ group.\n    *   **Quartet (q):** Indicates coupling to 3 adjacent protons (n=3), typically a CH₃ group.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a CH proton that is vicinally coupled to a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group. This means the carbon atom bearing our target proton must be directly bonded to the carbons of a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means a different single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to 1 adjacent proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to 2 adjacent protons (n=2).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to another, different set of 2 adjacent protons (n=2).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a CH proton that is vicinally coupled to one CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's analyze the connectivity of each proposed structure to see if they can produce these specific splitting patterns. We'll focus on the CH (methine) protons, as they are the most likely to have such complex environments. Let's assume the condensed formulas represent a linear carbon backbone with the bracketed groups as substituents.\n\n*   **A) `CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH` (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The `CH` at position 3 has neighbors: a `CH₂` (at C4) and a `CH` (at C2). This would give a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    *   The `CH` at position 2 has neighbors: a `CH` (at C3) and a `CH₃` (on C2). This would give a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   This structure does not produce a `dtq` or a `dtt`.\n\n*   **B) `(CH₃)₂CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH` (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The `CH` at position 4 has neighbors: a `CH` (at C3) and two `CH₃` groups on the same carbon. Only vicinal coupling to the `CH` at C3 applies. This would give a doublet.\n    *   The `CH` at position 3 has neighbors: a `CH` (at C4) and a `CH₂` (at C2). This would give a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    *   This structure does not produce a `dtq` or a `dtt`.\n\n*   **C) `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH` (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)**\n    Let's number the main chain: `CH₃(6)-CH(5)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(2)-COOH(1)`. This parsing is incorrect based on the formula.\n    Let's parse `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH` as `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`. This is 3-ethyl-4-(1-ethylpropyl)-... this gets confusing.\n    Let's parse it as a chain starting from `CH₃` where C has substituents: `CH₃-C(H)(Et)-C(H)(Et)-CH₂COOH`. This structure doesn't balance valency.\n\n    Let's assume the standard representation: `CH₃` group, then `CH(C₂H₅)`, then `CH(C₂H₅)`, then `CH₂COOH` all linked linearly.\n    `CH₃-CH(a)(C₂H₅)-CH(b)(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(a):** Its carbon is bonded to a `CH₃` group, a `CH(b)` group, and a `CH₂` group (from its own ethyl substituent).\n        *   Neighbors: The `CH₃` group (3H -> **quartet**), the `CH(b)` group (1H -> **doublet**), and the ethyl `CH₂` group (2H -> **triplet**).\n        *   This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first piece of data.\n    *   **Proton H(b):** Its carbon is bonded to a `CH(a)` group, a `CH₂` group (of the main chain), and another `CH₂` group (from its own ethyl substituent).\n        *   Neighbors: The `CH(a)` group (1H -> **doublet**), the main-chain `CH₂` group (2H -> **triplet**), and the ethyl `CH₂` group (2H -> **triplet**).\n        *   This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second piece of data.\n    *   This structure perfectly explains both of the complex signals observed.\n\n*   **D) `CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH` (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The `CH` at position 3 has neighbors: a `CH₂` (at C4), a `CH` (at C2), and a `CH₂` (from its ethyl group). This would give a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one signal.\n    *   The `CH` at position 2 has neighbors: a `CH` (at C3) and a `CH₂` (from its ethyl group). This would give a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    *   This structure produces a `dtt` but not a `dtq`.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure C, `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`, has protons in environments that would result in both a `dtq` and a `dtt` splitting pattern. Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
