    "This problem asks for the scalar potential V and vector potential **A** generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that due to the finite speed of light, the field at an observation point **r** at time t is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded\", time `tr`.\n\n1.  **Definitions and Setup:**\n    *   `q`: the point charge.\n    *   `s(t)`: the position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n    *   `r`: the field observation point.\n    *   `tr`: the retarded time, the time at which the field observed at `(r, t)` was emitted by the charge.\n    *   The signal (electromagnetic field) travels from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`, arriving at time `t`. The distance traveled is `|r - s(tr)|`.\n    *   The time taken for this travel is `t - tr`. Since the signal travels at the speed of light `c`, we have the condition:\n        `t - tr = |r - s(tr)| / c`\n\n2.  **Using the Problem's Notation:**\n    *   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point is given as `d = r - s(tr)`.\n    *   The magnitude of this vector is `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is `v = ds(tr) / d(tr)`.\n    *   With this notation, the retarded time condition becomes `c(t - tr) = d`.\n\n3.  **Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:**\n    The scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge are derived from Jefimenko's equations or by evaluating the retarded potential integrals for a point charge. The standard results for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ( |r - s(tr)| - ( (r - s(tr)) ⋅ v(tr) ) / c )]`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v(tr) / ( |r - s(tr)| - ( (r - s(tr)) ⋅ v(tr) ) / c )]`\n\n4.  **Substituting the Problem's Notation into the Standard Formulas:**\n    Let's substitute `d`, `d`, and `v` into the denominator of the potential expressions:\n    *   Denominator = `|r - s(tr)| - ( (r - s(tr)) ⋅ v(tr) ) / c`\n    *   Denominator = `d - (d ⋅ v) / c`\n    *   To make it look like the options, we can factor out `1/c`:\n    *   Denominator = `(1/c) * (d*c - d ⋅ v)`\n\n    Now, let's substitute this new form of the denominator back into the expressions for V and **A**:\n\n    *   For the scalar potential `V`:\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ( (1/c) * (d*c - d ⋅ v) )]`\n        `V(r, t) = (qc) / (4πε₀ * (d*c - d ⋅ v))`\n\n    *   For the vector potential **A**:\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / ( (1/c) * (d*c - d ⋅ v) )]`\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ * q * c * v) / (4π * (d*c - d ⋅ v))`\n\n5.  **Comparison with Options:**\n    Let's compare our derived expressions with the given options.\n\n    *   **A) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀(d*c - d⋅v)), A(r,t) = μ₀qc*v / (4π(d*c - d⋅v))**\n        This perfectly matches our derived expressions.\n\n    *   **B) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀*r), ...**\n        This is the static Coulomb potential, which is incorrect for a moving charge as it neglects retardation and the motion's effect on the potential strength.\n\n    *   **C) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀*r), ...**\n        Same as B, this uses the static potential form.\n\n    *   **D) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀(d*c + d⋅v)), ...**\n        The sign in the denominator is positive (`+`), whereas the correct formula has a negative sign (`-`). A positive sign would correspond to \"advanced\" time, violating causality.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials using the given notation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
