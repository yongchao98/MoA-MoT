    "An oscillating charge distribution with a well-defined symmetry axis (the z-axis in this case) acts as an oscillating electric dipole. The radiation characteristics of such a dipole are a fundamental concept in electromagnetism.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations\n\n1.  **Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle, which we can denote as `dP/dΩ`, by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the formula:\n    `dP/dΩ = K * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle between the observation direction and the axis of the dipole (the z-axis), and `K` is a factor that depends on the dipole moment, frequency, and fundamental constants, but not on the angle `θ`.\n\n2.  **Maximum Radiated Power (A):**\n    The radiated power is maximum when the `sin²(θ)` term is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (or π/2 radians), perpendicular to the axis of oscillation.\n    So, the maximum power, `A`, is:\n    `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = K * sin²(90°) = K * (1)² = K`\n\n3.  **Radiated Power at θ = 30°:**\n    We want to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We use the same formula:\n    `(dP/dΩ)_30° = K * sin²(30°)`\n    The value of `sin(30°)` is `1/2`.\n    Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    So, `(dP/dΩ)_30° = K * (1/4) = A / 4`.\n\n4.  **Fraction of Maximum Power:**\n    The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power:\n    `Fraction = [(dP/dΩ)_30°] / A = (A / 4) / A = 1/4`\n\n5.  **Wavelength (λ) Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    The full expression for the power radiated per unit solid angle `f(θ, λ)` from an oscillating electric dipole is:\n    `f(θ, λ) = dP/dΩ = (μ₀ * p₀² * ω⁴) / (32 * π² * c) * sin²(θ)`\n    where `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n    The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the equation:\n    `ω = 2πv = 2πc / λ`\n    where `v` is the frequency and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n    Substituting this into the power formula, we see that the power is proportional to `ω⁴`:\n    `f(θ, λ) ∝ ω⁴`\n    `f(θ, λ) ∝ (2πc / λ)⁴`\n    `f(θ, λ) ∝ 1 / λ⁴` or `λ⁻⁴`\n\n    This `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of dipole radiation and is famously known as the reason for Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue (shorter, blue wavelengths are scattered much more strongly than longer, red wavelengths).\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form for the function `f`, representing the power's dependence on wavelength, is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nCombining these two results, we select the option that matches both findings.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
