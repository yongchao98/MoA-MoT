    "This problem involves concepts from Einstein's special theory of relativity, specifically time dilation and distance measurement in different inertial reference frames.\n\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reference Frames:**\n    *   **Frame S:** The reference frame of the Galaxy (considered stationary).\n    *   **Frame S':** The reference frame of the supernova ejecta (moving relative to the Galaxy).\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames (v) is 60,000 km/s. This is the speed of the ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's frame, and also the speed of the Galaxy's center as measured from the ejecta's frame.\n    *   The time interval measured in the ejecta's own reference frame (S') is Δt' = 50 s. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock that is at rest in the S' frame.\n    *   The speed of light (c) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n4.  **Formulate the Physics Equation:**\n    *   The distance (d) traveled in the Galaxy's frame is the velocity of the ejecta in that frame (v) multiplied by the time elapsed in that same frame (Δt).\n        `d = v * Δt`\n\n5.  **Find the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   We know the time in the ejecta's frame (Δt') but need the time in the Galaxy's frame (Δt). Due to time dilation, an observer in the Galaxy's frame will measure a longer time interval than the observer in the ejecta's frame.\n    *   The time dilation formula is:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n        where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   First, calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light (often denoted as β, beta):\n        `β = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        `β² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, substitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Substitute the value of γ and the proper time Δt' into the time dilation equation:\n        `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Distance (d):**\n    *   Now substitute the expressions for v and Δt into the distance formula:\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s]`\n    *   Combine the numerical terms:\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n9.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    *   To get the final numerical answer, we need to compute the value of the expression. We can use a python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants and given values\nv = 60000.0  # Velocity of ejecta in km/s\ndt_prime = 50.0  # Proper time in ejecta's frame in seconds\nc = 300000.0  # Speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the time dilation factor gamma\nbeta_squared = (v/c)**2\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame\ndt = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n```output\n3061862.178478839\n```\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. This value is very close to option B. The slight difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\nComparing the result with the given choices:\nA) 2,940,000 km\nB) 3,060,000 km\nC) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer if we ignored relativity, i.e., 60,000 km/s * 50 s)\nD) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe closest answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This is a problem of special relativity. We need to calculate the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the variables:**\n    *   The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The proper time, which is the time measured in the ejecta's moving frame, `Δt' = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Understand the concepts:**\n    *   From the perspective of an observer in the Galaxy's frame, time for the moving ejecta will appear to pass more slowly. This phenomenon is called **time dilation**.\n    *   The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time interval as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   The relationship between the time in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) and the proper time in the ejecta's frame (`Δt'`) is given by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n        where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, plug this into the formula for `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   `Δt ≈ (1 / 0.9798) * 50 s ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n5.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d):**\n    *   `d = v * Δt`\n    *   `d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    *   `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 km`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. Comparing this result to the given options:\n\n*   A) 2,940,000 km\n*   B) 3,060,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km\n*   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe value `3,060,000 km` is the closest to our calculated value. The small difference is due to rounding in the options.\n\n<<<B>>>"
