    "*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadening is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When considered with the broad O-H peak, it strongly indicates a carboxylic acid C=O group (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond (an alkene functional group) in the molecule.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid group. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl cation, `[COOH]+`. (Mass of C=12, O=16, H=1; Total = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n*   **Synthesizing the Information:**\n    *   The combined spectral data strongly suggest that the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. It must contain both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options based on Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is `DoU = C - H/2 + 1` (for a molecule containing C, H, and O).\n    *   Our target molecule needs at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C bond.\n\n    Let's calculate the DoU for each option:\n    *   A) C6H12O2: DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This molecule can have a carboxylic acid group OR a C=C bond, but not both. This does not fit the data.\n    *   B) C6H10O: This formula only has one oxygen atom, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid. This does not fit the data.\n    *   C) C6H10O2: DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. This molecule has two degrees of unsaturation, which can account for both the C=O bond of a carboxylic acid and the C=C bond of an alkene. It also has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid. This perfectly fits all the spectral data.\n    *   D) C6H12O: This formula only has one oxygen atom, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid. This does not fit the data.\n\nConclusion: The only formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence (FTIR, 1H NMR, and MS) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
