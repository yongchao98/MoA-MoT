    "*   **Analysis of the Starting Material (Compound X):**\n\n    1.  **IR Spectroscopy Data:**\n        *   The broad absorption in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to hydrogen bonding.\n        *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, specifically from a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of C=C bonds within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    2.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield, broad singlet signal is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the finding from the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the signal at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Region Analysis (the other substituent):**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a terminal ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons. This corresponds to the -CH₂- group from the ethyl fragment. It's a multiplet because it is coupled to both the terminal -CH₃ and the methine (-CH-) proton.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton. This corresponds to the methine (-CH-) proton. It's attached to the benzene ring (benzylic position), the adjacent methyl group (d), and the adjacent methylene group (m), resulting in complex splitting (a multiplet).\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The fragments are -CH(CH₃)- and -CH₂CH₃. Piecing them together on the methine carbon gives the **sec-butyl group**: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n\n    3.  **Structure of Compound X:** Based on the analysis, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n    *   The reaction is carried out with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    *   This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups.\n    *   Specifically, it reduces a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the alkyl side chain (sec-butyl) are unaffected by these conditions.\n    *   **Reaction:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid → [Product]\n    *   The -COOH group at position 1 of the benzene ring will be converted to a -CH₃ group. The sec-butyl group at position 4 will remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Identification of the Final Product:**\n\n    *   The product will have a methyl group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4 of the benzene ring.\n    *   The name of the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Matching with the Options:**\n\n    *   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect. The product is not a carboxylic acid.\n    *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Incorrect. This is the starting material, not the final product.\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: Correct. This matches the predicted structure of the final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
