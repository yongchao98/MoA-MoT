    "This problem requires us to determine the energies of the three lowest states for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### 1. Fundamental Principles\n\n*   **Particles:** The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** As fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by its full set of quantum numbers.\n*   **Quantum States in a 1D Well:** For a particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L, the quantum state is defined by two numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number `n`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin up) or `-1/2` (spin down).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy of a single particle in the `n`-th level is given by:\n    `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`\n    The problem defines a base energy unit `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`. Therefore, the energy of a single particle in level `n` is simply `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n\n### 2. State Configurations\n\nBecause of the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down. To find the total energy of the system, we sum the energies of the four individual particles. We must fill the energy levels in a way that corresponds to the ground state (lowest total energy), the first excited state (next lowest total energy), and so on.\n\nLet's list the single-particle energies:\n*   `E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E`\n*   `E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E`\n*   `E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E`\n*   `E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E`\n*   ...and so on.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Energies\n\nTo make this systematic, we can think of having a pool of available single-particle states, defined by their energy level `n`. Since each level can hold two particles, our pool of levels to choose from is `{1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, ...}`. We need to pick four levels for our four particles.\n\n**A) Ground State (E_gs)**\n\nTo obtain the lowest possible total energy, we must occupy the lowest available energy levels. We place two particles in the `n=1` level and two particles in the `n=2` level.\n\n*   Two particles in `n=1`: Energy = `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1E) = 2E`\n*   Two particles in `n=2`: Energy = `2 * E_2 = 2 * (4E) = 8E`\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:** `E_gs = 2E + 8E = 10E`\n\nThe configuration is (2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2).\n\n**B) First Excited State (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. We create this state by promoting one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available higher energy level. The lowest-energy promotion is to move a particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n\n*   Configuration: One particle is moved from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Two particles in `n=1`: Energy = `2 * E_1 = 2E`\n    *   One particle in `n=2`: Energy = `1 * E_2 = 4E`\n    *   One particle in `n=3`: Energy = `1 * E_3 = 9E`\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:** `E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n**C) Second Excited State (E_2nd)**\n\nThis is the state with the next lowest energy. We must consider all possible excitations from the ground state and find the second-cheapest one in terms of energy cost.\n\n1.  **First Excitation (already found):** Move a particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. Energy cost `ΔE = E_3 - E_2 = 9E - 4E = 5E`. Total Energy = `10E + 5E = 15E`.\n2.  **Second-Lowest Excitation:** Let's compare other possibilities:\n    *   **Option 1: Move a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`**.\n        *   Energy cost `ΔE = E_3 - E_1 = 9E - 1E = 8E`.\n        *   New configuration: One particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n        *   Total Energy = `(1*E_1) + (2*E_2) + (1*E_3) = 1E + 2*(4E) + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Option 2: Move a particle from `n=2` to `n=4`**.\n        *   Energy cost `ΔE = E_4 - E_2 = 16E - 4E = 12E`.\n        *   Total Energy = `10E + 12E = 22E`.\n    *   **Option 3: Move two particles from `n=2` to `n=3`**.\n        *   Energy cost `ΔE = 2 * (E_3 - E_2) = 2 * (5E) = 10E`.\n        *   Total Energy = `10E + 10E = 20E`.\n\nComparing the total energies of these excited states (`15E`, `18E`, `20E`, `22E`), the lowest is `15E` (the first excited state), and the next lowest is `18E`.\n\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy:** `E_2nd = 18E`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
