    "This problem requires identifying the correct reagents for two separate organic reactions. Let's analyze each reaction step by step.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction starts with a ketone (butan-2-one) and forms a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile). This is a characteristic cyanohydrin formation reaction, which is a nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl group.\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:** The reaction involves the addition of a cyanide group (-CN) and a hydrogen atom across the C=O double bond. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   `CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃ + CN⁻ ⇌ CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃`\n3.  **Determine the role of reagent A:** The alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group. Therefore, reagent A must be a proton source (an acid).\n    *   `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃`\n    *   Adding a strong acid directly to NaCN is dangerous as it liberates toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas. The reaction is typically performed by carefully adding acid to an aqueous solution of NaCN to generate HCN *in situ*, or by using a weak acid.\n4.  **Evaluate the options for A:**\n    *   `NaHSO₃` (Sodium bisulfite): This reagent is used for forming bisulfite adducts with aldehydes and some ketones, not for cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   `H₃O⁺` (Hydronium ion): This represents an acidic aqueous solution. It serves as the necessary proton source for the reaction.\n\nBased on this analysis, **A = H₃O⁺**. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction converts a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile. Note that the rest of the molecule, including the hydroxyl group, remains unchanged.\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid is a well-known reaction that requires harsh conditions, either strongly acidic or strongly basic, usually with heating. The reaction proceeds via an amide intermediate.\n    *   `R-CN + 2 H₂O --(catalyst)--> R-COOH + NH₃` (or NH₄⁺ in acid)\n3.  **Determine the role of reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis in the presence of water (H₂O). This catalyst must be either a strong acid or a strong base.\n4.  **Evaluate the options for B (from the remaining choices C and D):**\n    *   `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid): This is a strong mineral acid, commonly used to catalyze the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n    *   `CH₃COOH` (Acetic acid): This is a weak acid. While it might protonate the nitrile to some extent, it is generally not strong enough to catalyze the reaction to completion efficiently. Complete hydrolysis requires a strong acid like HCl or H₂SO₄.\n\nBased on this analysis, **B = HCl** is the most suitable reagent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   For the first reaction, reagent **A** must be a proton source, which is represented by **H₃O⁺**.\n*   For the second reaction, reagent **B** must be a strong acid to catalyze the nitrile hydrolysis, making **HCl** the correct choice.\n\nCombining these findings, A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
