    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state and charge placement:**\n    *   We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means the net charge on the conductor is zero.\n    *   A positive charge, `+q`, is placed inside a cavity within the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply the principles of charge induction in conductors:**\n    *   An electric field exists inside the cavity due to the charge `+q`.\n    *   However, a fundamental property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conducting material itself must be zero.\n    *   To achieve this, the free electrons within the conductor rearrange themselves. Negative charges (electrons) are attracted towards the `+q` charge and accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   To find the total charge induced on the inner surface, we can imagine a Gaussian surface just outside the cavity but still within the conducting material. Since the electric field everywhere on this surface is zero, the net electric flux through it is zero. By Gauss's Law ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_o}$), the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge `+q` and the induced charge on the inner surface, `q_inner`.\n    *   Therefore, `q + q_inner = 0`, which means `q_inner = -q`. A total charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n3.  **Consider the charge on the outer surface:**\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged. We have established that a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface.\n    *   Due to the law of conservation of charge, a corresponding positive charge must appear somewhere else on the conductor to maintain its overall initial charge (which was zero). This positive charge moves to the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   The charge on the outer surface, `q_outer`, must be `+q` so that the total charge of the conductor remains `q_inner + q_outer = -q + q = 0`.\n\n4.  **Determine the distribution of the outer surface charge:**\n    *   The charge `+q` is now on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n    *   The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. This means the distribution of charge on the outer surface is not affected by the configuration of charges inside the cavity (`+q` and the induced `-q`).\n    *   Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external charges in the vicinity, the charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface to minimize electrostatic repulsion.\n\n5.  **Calculate the electric field outside the conductor:**\n    *   We need to find the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor.\n    *   The electric field at any point outside a conductor is produced solely by the charges on its outer surface (and any other charges that might be external to the conductor, of which there are none in this problem).\n    *   We have a uniformly distributed charge `+q` on a spherical shell of radius `R`.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (a direct result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field of a point charge of the same total magnitude placed at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case, the total charge on the outer shell is `+q`. The center of the spherical conductor is O. The distance of point P from the center O is `L`.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n6.  **Evaluate the given information:**\n    *   The information about the cavity's radius (`r`), its position (`s`), the distance of P from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle (`Î¸`) is all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the electrostatic shielding effect. This extra information is intended to distract from the core principle.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The electric field at the external point P depends only on the net charge that appears on the outer surface (`+q`) and the distance from the center of the conductor (`L`). This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
