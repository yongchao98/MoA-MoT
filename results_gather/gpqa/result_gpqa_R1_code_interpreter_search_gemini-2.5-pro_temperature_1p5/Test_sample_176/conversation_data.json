    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2, which can be written as L₁ / L₂.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Luminosity of a Star:** The problem states the stars radiate as black bodies. The luminosity (L) of a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n        L = A * σ * T⁴\n        where A is the surface area (4πR² for a sphere), R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature.\n    *   **Temperature and Peak Wavelength:** The temperature of a black body is related to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (its peak wavelength, λ_max). This relationship is described by Wien's Displacement Law:\n        λ_max = b / T\n        where b is Wien's displacement constant. This λ_max is the wavelength in the star's own rest frame.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength of light from a moving source is shifted. Since the stars have radial velocities, I must consider the Doppler effect. The formula for the relativistic Doppler shift for light is:\n        λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c)\n        where λ_rest is the wavelength emitted by the source, v_r is the radial velocity (positive for receding, negative for approaching), and c is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    *   Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars:\n        L₁ = 4πR₁²σT₁⁴\n        L₂ = 4πR₂²σT₂⁴\n    *   The ratio is:\n        L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    *   Canceling the constants (4, π, σ):\n        L₁ / L₂ = (R₁² / R₂²) * (T₁⁴ / T₂⁴) = (R₁ / R₂)² * (T₁ / T₂)⁴\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Ratios:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio (R₁ / R₂):** The problem explicitly states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2.\n        R₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n    *   **Temperature Ratio (T₁ / T₂):** This is the more complex part.\n        *   The problem states \"the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest... are the same.\" This means their *observed* peak wavelengths are equal: λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂.\n        *   Let's relate the observed wavelength to the rest-frame wavelength for each star using the Doppler formula.\n            *   For Star_1: v_r₁ = 0 km/s.\n                λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁ * (1 + 0/c) = λ_rest₁\n            *   For Star_2: v_r₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s.\n                λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v_r₂ / c)\n        *   Since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we have:\n            λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v_r₂ / c)\n        *   Now, I can relate the rest-frame wavelengths to the temperatures using Wien's Law (λ_rest = b / T).\n            T = b / λ_rest  =>  λ_rest = b / T\n        *   Substitute this into the equation above:\n            b / T₁ = (b / T₂) * (1 + v_r₂ / c)\n        *   Cancel the constant `b`:\n            1 / T₁ = (1 / T₂) * (1 + v_r₂ / c)\n        *   Rearranging to find the temperature ratio T₁ / T₂:\n            T₂ / T₁ = 1 + v_r₂ / c\n            T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r₂ / c)\n\n5.  **Assemble the Final Calculation:**\n    *   Now I have both ratios needed for the luminosity calculation:\n        L₁ / L₂ = (R₁ / R₂)² * (T₁ / T₂)⁴\n        L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [ 1 / (1 + v_r₂ / c) ]⁴\n    *   The information about the masses (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is extraneous and not needed for this calculation, as we have more direct information about radius and temperature.\n\n6.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   I'll use a Python script for precision.\n    *   Values to be used:\n        *   R₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n        *   v_r₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n        *   c (speed of light) ≈ 299,792,458 m/s\n\nThis structured approach ensures all given information is considered, the correct physical laws are applied, and the final calculation is derived logically.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values from the problem\nR_ratio = 1.5  # R1 / R2\nv_r2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star_2 in m/s\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# The observed peak wavelengths are the same (lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2).\n# For Star 1 (v_r1 = 0), lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1.\n# For Star 2, lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c).\n# So, lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c).\n\n# According to Wien's Law, Temperature T is inversely proportional to the rest-frame peak wavelength (T = b / lambda_rest).\n# Therefore, T1 / T2 = lambda_rest2 / lambda_rest1.\n# From the relationship above, lambda_rest2 / lambda_rest1 = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c).\n# So, the temperature ratio is:\nT_ratio = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)\n\n# The luminosity L of a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4 * pi * R^2 * sigma * T^4.\n# The ratio of luminosities is L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.\nL_ratio = (R_ratio**2) * (T_ratio**4)\n\nprint(L_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n2.229120610996614\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated value is approximately 2.229. Looking at the options:\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.32\nC) ~2.23\nD) ~2.25\n\nThe result 2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 (L₁ / L₂).\n\n**1. Stefan-Boltzmann Law:**\nThe luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL = AσT⁴\nwhere A is the surface area (4πR² for a sphere), R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature.\n\nThe ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nCanceling the constants (4, π, σ), we get:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**2. Radius Ratio (R₁/R₂):**\nThe problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2.\nR₁ = 1.5 * R₂\nTherefore, R₁/R₂ = 1.5\n\n**3. Temperature Ratio (T₁/T₂):**\nThis is the most complex part and involves two principles: Wien's Displacement Law and the Doppler Effect.\n\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** Relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength (λ_rest) at which it emits light in its own rest frame.\n    T = b / λ_rest, where b is Wien's constant.\n    This means T is inversely proportional to λ_rest, so T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂/λ_rest₁.\n\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is shifted due to the star's radial velocity (v_r).\n    λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r/c)\n    The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same. This means their *observed* peak wavelengths are equal: λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂.\n\n*   **Applying the Doppler Effect to both stars:**\n    *   For Star_1: v_r₁ = 0 km/s.\n        λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁ * (1 + 0/c) = λ_rest₁\n    *   For Star_2: v_r₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s.\n        λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v_r₂/c)\n\n*   **Connecting the two:**\n    Since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we have:\n    λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v_r₂/c)\n\n*   **Finding the temperature ratio:**\n    We need T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂/λ_rest₁. From the equation above, we can rearrange to find this ratio:\n    λ_rest₂/λ_rest₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r₂/c)\n    Therefore, T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r₂/c).\n\n**4. Final Calculation:**\nNow we substitute the ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v_r₂/c)]⁴\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   v_r₂ = 700,000 m/s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 299,792,458 m/s\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + 700,000 / 299,792,458)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.00233496)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / 1.00233496]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (0.9976706)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 0.99072027\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.2291\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is extraneous and not needed for the calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
