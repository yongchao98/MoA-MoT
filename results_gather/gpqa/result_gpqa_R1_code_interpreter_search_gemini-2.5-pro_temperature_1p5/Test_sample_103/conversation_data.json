    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Relationship between Wavelength Shift and Radial Velocity**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift of spectral lines from their host star. The star \"wobbles\" due to the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. This wobble causes its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away.\n\n    The magnitude of the wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity, $v_r$, relative to the observer:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The *maximum* wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, which is called the RV semi-amplitude, denoted by $K$. Therefore, $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n\n    We are given the maximum periodic shifts for the two systems:\n    $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n    $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n    The ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n2.  **Relate RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters**\n    For a planet of mass $m_p$ orbiting a star of mass $M_{star}$ in a circular orbit with period $P$ and semi-major axis $a$, the RV semi-amplitude of the star is given by:\n    $K = \\frac{2 \\pi a}{P} \\frac{m_p}{M_{star} + m_p} \\sin(i)$\n    where $i$ is the orbital inclination (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane). Since the problem provides no information about the inclination, we assume it is the same for both systems, so the $\\sin(i)$ term will cancel out when we take a ratio.\n\n3.  **Use Kepler's Third Law**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period $P$ to the semi-major axis $a$:\n    $P^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 a^3}{G(M_{star} + m_p)}$\n    where G is the gravitational constant.\n\n    We can rearrange this to express $a$ in terms of $P$:\n    $a^3 = \\frac{G(M_{star} + m_p)P^2}{4\\pi^2}$\n    $a = \\left( \\frac{G(M_{star} + m_p)}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} P^{2/3}$\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations to Find the Relationship between K and P**\n    Substitute the expression for $a$ into the equation for $K$:\n    $K = \\frac{2 \\pi}{P} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star} + m_p} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{G(M_{star} + m_p)}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} P^{2/3} \\right]$\n\n    Now, let's look at the proportionality. We can group the constant terms.\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{P} \\frac{m_p}{(M_{star} + m_p)} (M_{star} + m_p)^{1/3} P^{2/3}$\n    $K \\propto \\frac{m_p}{(M_{star} + m_p)^{2/3}} P^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Apply the Proportionality to the Two Systems**\n    The problem states that the stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the planets have the same mass ($m_{p1} = m_{p2}$). This means the term $\\frac{m_p}{(M_{star} + m_p)^{2/3}}$ is the same for both systems.\n    Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**\n    We can write the ratio of the semi-amplitudes as:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We already found that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = 1.4$. So:\n    $1.4 = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides:\n    $(1.4)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n    $2.744 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n\n    The question asks for \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\", which corresponds to the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$.\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744}$\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**\n    To get the precise numerical value, we compute the inverse of 2.744.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods P2/P1\n# The ratio of RV semi-amplitudes K2/K1 is 7/5 = 1.4\n# The relationship is K is proportional to P^(-1/3)\n# So, K2/K1 = (P2/P1)^(-1/3)\n# 1.4 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)\n# P1/P2 = 1.4^3\n# P2/P1 = 1 / (1.4^3)\nresult = 1 / (1.4**3)\nprint(result)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.36443148688046646\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.364. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1 (i.e., it is shorter). Comparing this value to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.40\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 0.85\nD) ~ 1.96\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between Wavelength Shift and Radial Velocity (RV) Semi-Amplitude (K):** The Radial Velocity method relies on the Doppler effect. The periodic shift in the star's spectral lines is caused by its \"wobble\" as the planet orbits it. The magnitude of the star's velocity along our line of sight is called the radial velocity ($v_r$). The maximum radial velocity is the RV semi-amplitude, denoted by $K$. The wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to this velocity.\n    \n    $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n    \n    We are given the maximum periodic shifts for the two stars:\n    $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n    $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n    \n    Therefore, the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n2.  **Relate RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet with mass $m_p$ orbiting a star with mass $M_{star}$ in a circular orbit of period $P$, the RV semi-amplitude of the star is given by:\n    \n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{(M_{star} + m_p)^{2/3}}$\n    \n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit.\n\n3.  **Simplify for this specific problem:** The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star, 1} = M_{star, 2}$\n    *   The planets have the same mass: $m_{p, 1} = m_{p, 2}$\n    *   No information is given about inclination, so we assume $\\sin i$ is the same or that we are observing the maximum possible velocity for that system (i.e. edge-on, $\\sin i = 1$). In either case, the $\\sin i$ term is the same for both and cancels out in a ratio.\n    \n    All terms in the equation are constant for both systems *except* for $K$ and $P$. Therefore, we can establish a proportionality:\n    \n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods:** We can write the relationship for our two systems as:\n    \n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n    \n    Substitute the known value of $\\frac{K_2}{K_1}$:\n    \n    $1.4 = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n    \n    We want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$, which represents how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1. To solve for this, we can first raise both sides to the power of -3.\n    \n    $(1.4)^{-3} = \\left(\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3}\\right)^{-3}$\n    \n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = (1.4)^{-3} = \\frac{1}{1.4^3}$\n\n5.  **Compute the final value:**\n    \n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) ~ 1.40\n    B) ~ 0.36\n    C) ~ 0.85\n    D) ~ 1.96\n    \n    The calculated value of ~0.36 matches option B. This means the period of planet #2 is shorter than the period of planet #1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
