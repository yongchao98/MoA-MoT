    "The problem asks for the kinematically allowed decay channels of a boson X with a mass of $m_X = 6$ GeV. The interaction between the boson X and a fermion field $f$ is given by the Lagrangian:\n\n$$ \\mathcal{L}\\left(y\\right)=-\\lambda{f}\\bar{\\psi}{f}\\left(y\\right)\\left(\\upsilon+X\\left(y\\right)\\right)\\psi_{f}\\left(y\\right) $$\n\nThis Lagrangian describes how the boson X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. The relevant interaction term for the decay of X is:\n\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f X \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f $$\n\nThis term allows the boson X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, denoted as $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$.\n\nFor a decay to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the decaying particle (the parent particle) must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of the decay products (the daughter particles). In this case, the parent particle is the boson X, and the daughter particles are the fermion $f$ and its antiparticle $\\bar{f}$.\n\nThe kinematic condition is:\n$$ m_X \\ge m_f + m_{\\bar{f}} $$\n\nSince a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition simplifies to:\n$$ m_X \\ge 2m_f $$\n\nWe are given that the mass of the boson X is $m_X = 6$ GeV. Substituting this value into the inequality, we get:\n$$ 6 \\text{ GeV} \\ge 2m_f $$\nDividing by 2, we find the condition on the fermion mass $m_f$:\n$$ m_f \\le 3 \\text{ GeV} $$\n\nTherefore, the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$) as long as the mass of the fermion $f$ is less than or equal to 3 GeV.\n\nNow, we need to check the masses of all fundamental fermions (quarks and charged leptons) to see which ones satisfy this condition.\n\n**Quark Masses:**\n*   Up quark (u): $m_u \\approx 0.0022$ GeV.  ($0.0022 \\le 3$, so $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is allowed).\n*   Down quark (d): $m_d \\approx 0.0047$ GeV. ($0.0047 \\le 3$, so $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ is allowed).\n*   Strange quark (s): $m_s \\approx 0.095$ GeV.  ($0.095 \\le 3$, so $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is allowed).\n*   Charm quark (c): $m_c \\approx 1.27$ GeV.   ($1.27 \\le 3$, so $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is allowed).\n*   Bottom quark (b): $m_b \\approx 4.18$ GeV. ($4.18 > 3$, so $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **not** allowed).\n*   Top quark (t): $m_t \\approx 173$ GeV.   ($173 > 3$, so $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **not** allowed).\n\n**Lepton Masses:**\n*   Electron (e): $m_e \\approx 0.000511$ GeV. ($0.000511 \\le 3$, so $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is allowed).\n*   Muon ($\\mu$): $m_{\\mu} \\approx 0.1057$ GeV. ($0.1057 \\le 3$, so $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ is allowed).\n*   Tau ($\\tau$): $m_{\\tau} \\approx 1.777$ GeV.   ($1.777 \\le 3$, so $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is allowed).\n\nCombining all the kinematically allowed decay channels, we get:\n$X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}, d\\bar{d}, s\\bar{s}, c\\bar{c}, e^{+}e^{-}, \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}, \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$\n\nNow we compare this set with the given options:\n\nA) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$\nThis option includes the decay into a top-antitop pair ($t\\bar{t}$), which is kinematically forbidden as $m_X \\ll 2m_t$.\n\nB) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$\nThis option includes the decay into a bottom-antibottom pair ($b\\bar{b}$), which is kinematically forbidden as $m_X = 6$ GeV and $2m_b \\approx 8.36$ GeV.\n\nC) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$\nThis option lists exactly the set of decays we determined to be kinematically allowed. All listed fermions have a mass less than 3 GeV.\n\nD) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$\nThis option includes the forbidden decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ and incorrectly omits the allowed decays $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ and $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
