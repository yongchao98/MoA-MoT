    "This problem is about the energy-time uncertainty principle, a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics.\n\n**1. Understand the Concept**\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time states that it is impossible to know both the exact energy of a quantum state and the exact time it exists for. This relationship is mathematically expressed as:\n\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of the state (also known as the energy width or linewidth).\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which can be taken as the lifetime (τ) of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor practical purposes and order-of-magnitude estimations, we can use the simpler form:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State**\n\nWe are given two states with lifetimes τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s and τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s. We can calculate the inherent energy spread (ΔE) for each level.\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**3. Determine the Condition for Resolution**\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths. Think of it like trying to distinguish two broad peaks on a graph; they need to be separated by more than their combined width to be seen as distinct.\n\nRequired Energy Difference > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n**4. Calculate the Minimum Required Energy Difference**\n\nRequired Energy Difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\nRequired Energy Difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\nRequired Energy Difference > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nSo, the energy difference between the two levels, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**5. Compare with the Given Options**\n\nLet's examine the options to see which one satisfies this condition:\n\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (Much smaller than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV   (Much smaller than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV   (Smaller than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV   (Much larger than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\nOnly option D provides an energy separation that is large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly resolved. The other energy differences are smaller than the combined natural broadening of the levels, meaning the levels would overlap and be indistinguishable.\n\nWe can verify this with a simple Python calculation.\n```python\n# Reduced Planck's constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eV_s = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes\ntau1 = 1e-9  # s\ntau2 = 1e-8  # s\n\n# Energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eV_s / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eV_s / tau2\n\n# To be resolved, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the widths\nmin_energy_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of State 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.2e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of State 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.2e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Minimum required energy difference for resolution: {min_energy_difference:.2e} eV\")\n\n# Checking the options\noptions = {'A': 1e-11, 'B': 1e-9, 'C': 1e-8, 'D': 1e-4}\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nfor opt, val in options.items():\n    if val > min_energy_difference:\n        print(f\"Option {opt} ({val:.1e} eV) is large enough.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {opt} ({val:.1e} eV) is too small.\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a physics problem based on the energy-time uncertainty principle.\n\n1.  **Identify the core principle:** The problem involves lifetimes of quantum states and their energy levels. This points directly to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which states ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. The lifetime (τ) of a state is the uncertainty in time (Δt), so ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. ΔE is the inherent uncertainty or \"width\" of the energy level.\n\n2.  **Define \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\":** For two energy levels (or any two overlapping distributions, like spectral lines) to be considered resolved, the separation between their centers (the energy difference |E1 - E2|) must be greater than the sum of their individual widths (ΔE1 + ΔE2). This is a common criterion for resolution. The energy of each state is not a sharp line but a distribution with a width of approximately ΔE. To see them as two distinct levels, their separation must be larger than their combined fuzziness.\n\n3.  **Calculate the energy width for each state:**\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n\n4.  **Find the necessary physical constant:** I need the value of the reduced Planck's constant (ħ) in units that are convenient for this problem, which are electron-volts and seconds (eV·s). A quick search or recall gives ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n5.  **Perform the calculations:**\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n6.  **Calculate the minimum required separation for resolution:**\n    *   Required energy difference > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    *   Required energy difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   Required energy difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   Required energy difference > 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV\n\n    I need to find the option that is greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   10⁻¹¹ eV < 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   10⁻⁹ eV = 0.01 x 10⁻⁷ eV < 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV < 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   10⁻⁴ eV = 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Only option D, 10⁻⁴ eV, provides an energy separation that is significantly larger than the combined energy widths of the two states. Therefore, this is the only option that would allow the two energy levels to be clearly resolved.\n\n9.  **Final verification:** The reasoning is sound and the calculations are straightforward. The Python code executed confirms the hand calculation. The output clearly shows that the minimum required energy difference is ~7.24e-07 eV and that only option D exceeds this value. The logic holds. I am ready to provide the final answer. This problem is solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. Here is the reasoning:\n\n**1. The Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle**\n\nThe principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which we can know both the energy of a quantum state and its lifetime. The mathematical relationship is:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   **ΔE** is the uncertainty in energy, also known as the natural linewidth or energy width of the state.\n*   **Δt** is the lifetime of the state (τ).\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor estimation purposes, we can use the approximation:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nThis ΔE represents the inherent \"fuzziness\" or spread in the energy of the level. A shorter lifetime (τ) leads to a larger energy uncertainty (ΔE).\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy Width of Each State**\n\nWe need to calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each of the two quantum states.\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**3. The Condition for Resolving the Energy Levels**\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies (E_diff = |E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than their combined widths, the two \"fuzzy\" energy levels will overlap too much to be seen as distinct.\n\n*   **Condition for resolution:** E_diff > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n**4. Calculate the Minimum Required Energy Difference**\n\nLet's find the minimum energy separation needed:\n\n*   Minimum E_diff > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n*   Minimum E_diff > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   Minimum E_diff > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nSo, for the energy levels to be clearly resolved, their energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**5. Compare with the Given Options**\n\nNow we check which of the provided options satisfies this condition:\n\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (<< 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV   (<< 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV   (< 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV   (>> 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)**\n\nOnly option D provides an energy difference large enough to be clearly distinguished from the combined natural broadening of the two quantum states.\n\n<<<D>>>"
