    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nThe formula for the degree of unsaturation is:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\nWhere C = number of carbons, H = number of hydrogens, X = number of halogens, and N = number of nitrogens.\n*   C = 9, H = 11, N = 1\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond or ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** These two distinct peaks in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester. The conjugation with a benzene ring slightly lowers the frequency from a simple alkyl ester (~1740 cm⁻¹), making 1720 cm⁻¹ a very reasonable value.\n\n**Summary from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester group (R-COO-R').\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** A methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The neighbors have 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This indicates a -CH₂- group is adjacent.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** A methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The neighbors have 3 protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This indicates a -CH₃ group is adjacent.\n    *   **Putting them together:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm are a classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH₂ group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-COO-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** A broad signal for 2H in this region is very typical for the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂) group. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and potential hydrogen exchange. This confirms the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (4H total):** Four protons in the aromatic region, confirming the benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** Two doublets, each representing 2 protons, are the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The large difference in chemical shifts (7.0 ppm vs. 8.0 ppm) indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing. The -NH₂ group is a strong donating group, and the ester group (-COOEt) is a withdrawing group. The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH₂ group are shielded and appear upfield (at 7.0 ppm). The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOEt group are deshielded and appear downfield (at 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure:**\n*   From the DoU, we have a benzene ring and a C=O double bond.\n*   From IR and NMR, we have a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   From IR and NMR, we have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   From NMR, the benzene ring is para-substituted with the -NH₂ group and the -COOCH₂CH₃ group.\n\nCombining these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check the molecular formula:\nBenzene ring (C₆H₄) + Ethyl ester (-COOC₂H₅) + Amine (-NH₂) = C₉H₁₁NO₂. This matches the given formula.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options:**\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (-COCH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- protons would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data and the molecular formula as deduced above.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, not an ester, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. Also, the substitution pattern is meta, not para.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the two N-H stretches in the IR spectrum. It would also show a formyl proton signal (~8.2 ppm, singlet) in the ¹H NMR, which is absent.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
