    "This is a problem about radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. The key property of this distribution is that it's \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Decay Law:**\n    The probability `P(t)` that an atom survives (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    P(t) = e^(-λt)\n    where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n    The probability that the atom *does* decay within time `t` is `1 - P(t)`.\n\n2.  **Using the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   Probability of decay in 100 min = 1 - P(100) = 0.32\n    *   This means the probability of survival for 100 minutes is P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n\n    Now we can use the survival formula to find `λ`:\n    *   0.68 = e^(-λ * 100)\n    *   To solve for λ, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        ln(0.68) = -100λ\n        λ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\n3.  **Calculating the Required Probability:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n\n    Because the decay process is memoryless, the fact that it has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant. The clock effectively \"resets\". Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the probability that a new atom will decay within 150 minutes.\n\n    *   Probability of decay in 150 min = 1 - P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\n4.  **Putting it all together:**\n    We substitute the expression for `λ` into our probability equation.\n    *   Probability = 1 - e^([-ln(0.68) / 100] * 150)\n    *   Probability = 1 - e^(ln(0.68) * (150 / 100))\n    *   Probability = 1 - e^(ln(0.68) * 1.5)\n    *   Using the identity e^(ln(x)) = x, we get e^(ln(0.68) * 1.5) = (e^ln(0.68))^1.5 = 0.68^1.5\n    *   Probability = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\n    We can now compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of 0.68 raised to the power of 1.5\nsurvival_prob = 0.68 ** 1.5\n\n# The probability of decay is 1 minus the probability of survival\ndecay_prob = 1 - survival_prob\n\n# Print the result as a percentage\nprint(f\"{decay_prob * 100:.2f}%\")\n```\n\nThe calculation shows that the probability is approximately 44.37%.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Define the Decay Law:** Radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The probability `P_survive(t)` that an atom survives for a time `t` is given by:\n    `P_survive(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant, a value specific to the type of atom. Consequently, the probability of an atom decaying within a time `t` is `P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survive(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information to Characterize the Atom:** We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P_decay(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    From this, we can find the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\n    `P_survive(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    This equation links the decay constant `λ` to a known probability and time.\n\n3.  **Apply the \"Memoryless\" Property:** The core principle of radioactive decay is that it's a \"memoryless\" process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior. The problem is equivalent to asking: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay in 150 minutes?\"\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability:** We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which is `P_decay(150)`.\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survive(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Probability:** We can solve this without explicitly finding the value of `λ`. We use the relationship we found in step 2:\n    `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`\n    We can write `e^(-λ * 150)` in terms of this known value:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    Now, substitute the known value (0.68):\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    The probability of survival for 150 minutes is `(0.68)^1.5`.\n\n    Therefore, the probability of decay in 150 minutes is:\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation:** The Python code from the reasoning step calculated this value:\n    `1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 1 - 0.5606... ≈ 0.4393`\n    Converting this to a percentage gives 43.93%.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated probability is approximately 44%. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
