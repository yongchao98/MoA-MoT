    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleus (X)**\n    *   The problem specifies the nucleus X as \"Li with 3 neutrons\".\n    *   Lithium (Li) is defined by its atomic number (Z), which is the number of protons. For Lithium, Z = 3.\n    *   The problem states it has 3 neutrons (N = 3).\n    *   The mass number (A) is the total number of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleus in question is an isotope of Lithium called Lithium-6, denoted as $^{6}$Li.\n\n2.  **Determine the Rest Energy (E₀ = m₀c²)**\n    The rest energy can be calculated in two ways:\n    *   **Method A (Physically Correct):** Using the actual measured mass of the $^{6}$Li nucleus. This mass accounts for the binding energy that holds the nucleus together.\n    *   **Method B (Approximation):** Summing the rest masses of the individual constituent protons and neutrons. This method ignores the binding energy.\n\n    In physics problems of this type, sometimes the approximate method is intended. Let's calculate the rest energy using both methods to see which one matches the options.\n\n    We need the following standard values:\n    *   Rest energy of a proton (mₚc²): ≈ 938.272 MeV\n    *   Rest energy of a neutron (mₙc²): ≈ 939.565 MeV\n\n    **Using Method B (Approximation):**\n    The rest energy E₀ is the sum of the rest energies of 3 protons and 3 neutrons.\n    E₀ = 3 * (mₚc²) + 3 * (mₙc²)\n    E₀ = 3 * (938.272 MeV + 939.565 MeV)\n    E₀ = 3 * (1877.837 MeV)\n    E₀ = 5633.511 MeV\n    Converting to Giga-electron Volts (GeV), since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n    E₀ = 5.6335 GeV\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n    The total relativistic energy (E) is given by the formula E = γE₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n    The Lorentz factor depends on the speed (v) of the nucleus, which is given as v = 0.96c (where c is the speed of light).\n    The formula for γ is:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    Substituting v = 0.96c:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²)\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n    γ = 1 / √(0.0784)\n    γ = 1 / 0.28\n    γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\n    Now we can calculate the total energy using the formula E = γ * E₀.\n    E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.6335 GeV\n    E ≈ 20.1197 GeV\n\n    For completeness, if we had used the physically correct rest energy of a $^{6}$Li nucleus (which is E₀ ≈ 5601.5 MeV = 5.6015 GeV, accounting for binding energy), the result would be E = 3.5714 * 5.6015 GeV ≈ 20.005 GeV.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options**\n    The calculated energy using the approximate method is E ≈ 20.120 GeV. Let's compare this to the given options:\n    A) 23.069 GeV\n    B) 18.475 GeV\n    C) 21.419 GeV\n    D) 20.132 GeV\n\n    Our calculated value of 20.120 GeV is extremely close to option D, 20.132 GeV. The small difference (about 0.06%) is likely due to using slightly different values for the proton/neutron masses in the source material for the question. The physically correct answer (20.005 GeV) is not as close to any of the options. This strongly suggests the intended calculation method was the approximation that ignores binding energy.\n\nTo confirm with a script:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nm_p_MeV = 938.272  # Proton rest energy in MeV\nm_n_MeV = 939.565  # Neutron rest energy in MeV\nc = 1 # We work in units where c=1\nv = 0.96 # speed in units of c\n\n# Nucleus composition\nnum_protons = 3\nnum_neutrons = 3\n\n# Calculate rest energy (E0) by summing constituents\nE0_MeV = num_protons * m_p_MeV + num_neutrons * m_n_MeV\nE0_GeV = E0_MeV / 1000\n\n# Calculate Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v**2)\n\n# Calculate total energy (E)\ntotal_energy_GeV = gamma * E0_GeV\n\n# Print result with required precision\nprint(f\"The calculated total energy is {total_energy_GeV:.4f} GeV\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleus and its Constituents**\n    *   The problem specifies the nucleus X as Lithium (Li). The atomic number of Lithium is Z=3, which means it has 3 protons.\n    *   It is stated to have 3 neutrons (N=3).\n    *   The total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) is the mass number A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleus is an isotope of Lithium, specifically $^{6}$Li.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀) of the Nucleus**\n    *   The rest energy of the nucleus can be approximated by summing the rest energies of its individual constituent particles (3 protons and 3 neutrons). This approach ignores the nuclear binding energy, but it is a common method for such problems, and we will see if it leads to one of the answers.\n    *   We need the standard rest energy values for a proton and a neutron:\n        *   Rest energy of a proton (mₚc²): 938.272 MeV\n        *   Rest energy of a neutron (mₙc²): 939.565 MeV\n    *   The total rest energy E₀ is:\n        E₀ = 3 * (mₚc²) + 3 * (mₙc²)\n        E₀ = 3 * (938.272 MeV + 939.565 MeV)\n        E₀ = 3 * (1877.837 MeV) = 5633.511 MeV\n    *   Since the answers are in Giga-electron Volts (GeV), we convert MeV to GeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n        E₀ = 5.633511 GeV\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n    *   The total relativistic energy (E) is related to the rest energy (E₀) and the speed (v) by the equation E = γE₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The speed is given as v = 0.96c.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    *   Substitute v = 0.96c into the formula:\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²)\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n        γ = 1 / √(0.0784)\n        γ = 1 / 0.28\n        γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\n    *   Now, we use the formula E = γ * E₀.\n    *   E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.633511 GeV\n    *   E ≈ 20.1197 GeV\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options**\n    *   Our calculated value is approximately 20.1197 GeV.\n    *   Let's look at the options provided:\n        A) 23.069 GeV\n        B) 18.475 GeV\n        C) 21.419 GeV\n        D) 20.132 GeV\n    *   The calculated energy (20.1197 GeV) is extremely close to option D (20.132 GeV). The small discrepancy (about 0.06%) is likely due to using slightly different values for the proton/neutron rest mass constants in the problem's source. No other option is close.\n\nThe code execution confirms this calculation. The output `The calculated total energy is 20.1197 GeV` is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
