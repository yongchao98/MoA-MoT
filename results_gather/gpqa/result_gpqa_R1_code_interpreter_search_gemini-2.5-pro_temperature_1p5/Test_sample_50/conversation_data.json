    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Problem Setup and Method of Image Charges**\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded sphere has a potential of zero (V=0).\n\nThis problem can be simplified using the method of image charges. The electric field and potential outside the sphere, created by the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere's surface, are identical to the field and potential created by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'`, with the sphere itself removed.\n\nFor a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center, along the line connecting the center and `q`) are chosen to make the potential on the spherical surface (at radius `R`) equal to zero. The standard results for this configuration are:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located inside the sphere, between the center and the surface, since `d > R` implies `b < R`.\n\n**2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere.\n\nA general formula for the electrostatic potential energy (`U`) of a system of charges and conductors is `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all other charges in the system.\n\nFor our system, this sum includes the point charge `q` and the continuous distribution of induced charge on the sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q + (1/2) * ∫ V_sphere * σ_induced * dA`\n\n*   `V_sphere` is the potential on the surface of the sphere, which is zero because it is grounded. Therefore, the second term is zero.\n*   `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` due to all *other* charges, which are the induced charges on the sphere. Let's call this `V_induced`.\n\nSo the formula simplifies to:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n**3. Finding the Potential due to Induced Charges (`V_induced`)**\n\nAccording to the method of images, the potential created by the induced charges outside the sphere (`V_induced`) is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\nWe need to calculate the potential at the position of `q` (at distance `d` from the center) that is created by the image charge `q'` (at distance `b` from the center). The distance between the charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n\n`V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\nwhere `k = 1/(4πε₀)` is Coulomb's constant.\n\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n`q' = -qR/d`\n`b = R^2/d`\n\n`d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for `V_induced`:\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n\nThe `d` in the denominator cancels out:\n`V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Final Calculation of Potential Energy (`U`)**\n\nNow, substitute the expression for `V_induced` back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result is negative, which is expected because the charge `q` is attracted to the grounded sphere (the induced charge on the side nearer to `q` is of opposite sign).\n\n**5. Comparing with the Options**\n\nLet's compare our result with the given choices:\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur calculated potential energy `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
