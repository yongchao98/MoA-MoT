    "An isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator is a fundamental system in quantum mechanics. Its potential energy is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$, where $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$.\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system, $H\\psi = E\\psi$, is separable in Cartesian coordinates. The Hamiltonian can be written as a sum of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians:\n$H = H_x + H_y + H_z = \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2x^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2y^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2z^2\\right)$\n\nThe energy eigenvalues are the sum of the energies of the three one-dimensional oscillators. The energy of a 1D harmonic oscillator is $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n=0, 1, 2, ...$.\n\nFor the 3D case, the total energy is:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\nwhere $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers.\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels can be expressed as:\n$E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $N=0, 1, 2, ...$\n\nWe can now identify the energy of the different states:\n1.  **Ground State:** This corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which occurs when $N=0$. This is only possible for the combination $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (0, 0, 0)$.\n    Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n2.  **First Excited State:** This is the next energy level, corresponding to $N=1$.\n    Energy: $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n3.  **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=2$.\n    Energy: $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=3$.\n    Energy: $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nNext, we need to find the degeneracy of this energy level. The degeneracy is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that yield the same energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ that satisfy the condition $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n\nWe can list the possible combinations:\n*   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0: $(3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3)$. There are 3 such states.\n*   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0: $(2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2)$. There are 6 such states.\n*   All three quantum numbers are 1: $(1,1,1)$. There is 1 such state.\n\nThe total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nAlternatively, the degeneracy for a level with principal quantum number $N$ for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n$g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$\nFor the third excited state, $N=3$, so the degeneracy is:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\nB) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\nC) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\nD) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\n\nOur calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
