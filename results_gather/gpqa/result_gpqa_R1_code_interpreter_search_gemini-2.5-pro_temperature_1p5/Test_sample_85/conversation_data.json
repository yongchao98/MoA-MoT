    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product of both reactions is a substituted lactone: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break this down:\n*   **Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one:** This is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (a pyran ring), which is saturated (tetrahydro) and has a carbonyl group (ketone, C=O) at the C-2 position. This specific structure is a delta-lactone. The ring atoms are O(1)-C(2)(=O)-C(3)-C(4)-C(5)-C(6)-.\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the carbon at position 4 of the ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The carbon at position 4 is a chiral center. The problem specifies the product of reaction 1 is the (R)-enantiomer and the product of reaction 2 is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n**2. Identify the Lactone Precursor**\n\nLactones are cyclic esters formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. To form the six-membered ring of the product, a 5-hydroxy-carboxylic acid is needed. Let's deduce the structure of the linear precursor:\n*   Breaking the ester bond in the lactone (between O-1 and C-2) and adding H2O conceptually gives a linear molecule.\n*   The O-1 gets an H to become an alcohol (-OH). The C-2 gets an OH to become a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   The linear chain is HOOC(C2)-C3-C4(Et)-C5-C6-(OH).\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature for the acid, the carboxylic acid carbon is C1. So the structure is:\n    HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH.\n*   The name of this precursor is **3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid**.\n*   The chiral center in this acid is C-3. Upon cyclization, C-3 of the acid becomes C-4 of the lactone. Since the bonds to the chiral center are not broken during lactonization, the stereochemistry is retained.\n    *   (R)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid will form (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n    *   (S)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid will form (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**3. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reducing Agents**\n\nThe options provided list the starting material as \"(R/S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This name describes a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\nThe structure is: **HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu** (where iBu = isobutyl, -CH2CH(CH3)2).\nThis molecule has two functional groups that can be reduced:\n*   A carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   An ester (-COOiBu)\nIt also has a chiral center at C-3, where the ethyl group is attached.\n\nThe two reducing agents have different selectivities:\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** A mild reducing agent that reduces aldehydes, ketones, and esters, but it does **not** reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** A strong reducing agent that readily reduces carboxylic acids. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids much faster than esters, allowing for selective reduction.\n\n**4. Trace Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Starting material A (HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu) is treated with LiBH4.\n    2.  LiBH4 selectively reduces the ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is left unchanged.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH (3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid).\n    4.  Under acidic workup (H+), this hydroxy-acid undergoes intramolecular cyclization to form the lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction converts the ester group to an alcohol, but it does not affect the chiral center at C-3. The stereochemistry is retained throughout the process.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the final product is the (R)-lactone, the intermediate must be the (R)-hydroxy-acid, which means the starting material **A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Trace Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Starting material B (HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu) is treated with BH3.\n    2.  BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The ester group (-COOiBu) is initially unaffected due to the much faster reduction of the acid.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n    4.  During the acidic workup (H+), the alcohol group on one end of the molecule attacks the ester carbonyl on the other end. This intramolecular transesterification reaction forms the stable six-membered lactone ring and displaces isobutanol (iBuOH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction pathway also does not involve breaking any bonds at the C-3 chiral center. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the final product is the (S)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy-ester must have the (S) configuration, which means the starting material **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A is the **(R)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B is the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\nA) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n<<<A>>>"
