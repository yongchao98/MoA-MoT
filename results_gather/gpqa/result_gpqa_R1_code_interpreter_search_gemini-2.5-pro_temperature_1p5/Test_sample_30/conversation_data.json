    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**\n*   **Reactants:** Toluene and a mixture of nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically, the nitration of an aromatic ring. The mixture of HNO₃ and H₂SO₄ generates the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), which is the electrophile.\n*   **Directing Effects:** Toluene has a methyl group (-CH₃), which is an ortho, para-director and an activating group.\n*   **Product 1:** The electrophile (NO₂⁺) will be directed to the ortho and para positions. Due to steric hindrance, the para product is typically the major product. Therefore, Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** MnO₂ in acidic medium is a strong oxidizing agent. It is commonly used to oxidize benzylic carbons (a carbon atom attached to a benzene ring) that have at least one hydrogen atom.\n*   **Product 2:** The methyl group (-CH₃) of p-nitrotoluene is oxidized to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The nitro group (-NO₂) is resistant to these oxidizing conditions. Thus, Product 2 is p-nitrobenzoic acid (4-nitrobenzoic acid).\n    *   The structure of p-nitrobenzoic acid has C₂ᵥ symmetry.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third reaction.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (p-nitrobenzoic acid) is treated with acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Reaction Chemistry:** This step is the most complex and can have multiple possible outcomes.\n    1.  First, an acid-base reaction occurs. The strong base NaOH deprotonates the most acidic proton in the mixture, which is from the carboxylic acid group of p-nitrobenzoic acid, forming sodium p-nitrobenzoate.\n    2.  NaOH also deprotonates acetone at the α-carbon to a small extent, forming the acetone enolate ([CH₂C(O)CH₃]⁻). This enolate is a strong carbon-based nucleophile.\n    3.  The p-nitrobenzoate ring is electron-deficient due to the powerful electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group (-NO₂). This makes the ring susceptible to nucleophilic aromatic substitution. The positions most activated for nucleophilic attack are those ortho and para to the nitro group. In p-nitrobenzoate, the positions ortho to the nitro group (C3 and C5) are highly activated.\n*   **Identifying the Reaction Product (Product 3):**\n    *   **Path A: Vicarious Nucleophilic Substitution (VNS).** The acetone enolate can attack one of the activated C-H positions on the ring (C3 or C5), displacing a hydride ion (which is subsequently oxidized) to form a new C-C bond. A single substitution would yield 3-acetonyl-4-nitrobenzoic acid. This molecule is asymmetric and belongs to the C₁ point group, which is not an option.\n    *   **Path B: Double Vicarious Nucleophilic Substitution.** Given that both C3 and C5 positions are activated, and a symmetric product is implied by the options, it is reasonable to assume a double substitution occurs, where two molecules of acetone enolate react at both the C3 and C5 positions. This would require a sufficient amount of the reagents. The resulting molecule is **3,5-bis(acetonyl)-4-nitrobenzoic acid**.\n    *   **Path C: Reductive Coupling.** Another known, though less common, reaction of nitroarenes with acetone and base is the reduction of the nitro group, leading to dimerization. This could form an azoxy compound (-N=N(O)-) or an azo compound (-N=N-). The final trans-azo product, trans-4,4'-azobenzenedicarboxylic acid, would have C₂h symmetry (an option). The intermediate trans-azoxy product would have Cₛ symmetry if planar, but is known to be non-planar (C₁).\n\n*   **Choosing the Most Plausible Product:** The reaction between a carbon nucleophile (enolate) and an activated aromatic ring (VNS) is a more direct and fundamental reaction pathway than the reductive coupling by acetone. To obtain a product that matches the given symmetry options, we infer that the VNS reaction proceeds at both activated sites. Thus, we identify Product 3 as 3,5-bis(acetonyl)-4-nitrobenzoic acid.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3.**\n*   **Molecule:** 3,5-bis(acetonyl)-4-nitrobenzoic acid.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring is substituted as follows:\n    *   C1: -COOH (carboxylic acid)\n    *   C4: -NO₂ (nitro)\n    *   C3: -CH₂C(O)CH₃ (acetonyl)\n    *   C5: -CH₂C(O)CH₃ (acetonyl)\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** Consider a plane that contains the C1 and C4 atoms and their substituents (-COOH and -NO₂) and is perpendicular to the plane of the benzene ring.\n        *   This plane bisects the C1-C4 bond axis.\n        *   It reflects the atom at C2 (H) onto the atom at C6 (H).\n        *   It reflects the substituent at C3 (-CH₂C(O)CH₃) onto the substituent at C5 (-CH₂C(O)CH₃). Since these groups are identical, the molecule can adopt a conformation where they are mirror images of each other.\n        *   Therefore, the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Rotation Axes (Cₙ):** There are no rotation axes (for n > 1). A C₂ axis along the C1-C4 direction is absent because the substituents (-COOH and -NO₂) are different.\n    *   **Inversion Center (i):** There is no center of inversion.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule's only symmetry element besides the identity (E) is a single plane of symmetry (σ). A molecule with only E and σ belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
