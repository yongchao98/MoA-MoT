    "Here is a systematic approach to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the description and draw the structure.\n\nWe will build the structure step-by-step on a benzene ring, assigning C1 to the principal functional group, which will be the carboxylic acid.\n\n1.  **Principal group and para substituent:** The highest priority functional group is the carboxylic acid (-COOH). We place it at C1. This makes the parent name \"benzoic acid\". The methoxy group (-OCH3) is *para* to the carboxylic acid, so it must be at C4.\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n\n2.  **Meta groups:** A carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as \"formyl\" as a substituent) and a cyano group (-CN) are *meta* to the carboxylic acid. The meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. So, {C3, C5} will have {-CHO, -CN}.\n\n3.  **Ortho groups:** A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6. So, {C2, C6} will have {-OH, -N(CH3)2}.\n\n4.  **Final constraint (The key to the structure):** \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   We know the methoxy group (-OCH3) is fixed at C4.\n    *   The nitrile group (-CN) must be *ortho* to the methoxy group. The ortho positions to C4 are C3 and C5. This is consistent with what we know from step 2.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be *ortho* to the same nitrile group.\n\n    Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n    *   **Case A: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** Its ortho positions are C4 and C6. The methoxy is at C4 (which works). This means the hydroxyl group (-OH) *must* be at C6. This fits the information from step 3. If -OH is at C6, then the -N(CH3)2 group must be at C2, and the -CHO group must be at C3. This structure is inconsistent because it would place the -OH and -N(CH3)2 groups at C2 and C6, and the -CHO and -CN at C3 and C5, which are all ortho/meta to each other. Let's recheck the key constraint again.\n\n    *   **Case B: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** Its ortho positions are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is at C4 (which works). This means the hydroxyl group (-OH) *must* be at C2. This perfectly places the -OH group.\n    *   Now we can place the remaining groups:\n        *   -OH is at C2, so the dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group must be at C6 (the other ortho position from step 3).\n        *   -CN is at C3, so the carbaldehyde (-CHO) group must be at C5 (the other meta position from step 2).\n\n5.  **Final Structure:** Based on this logical deduction, the unique structure is:\n    *   **C1:** -COOH\n    *   **C2:** -OH (hydroxyl)\n    *   **C3:** -CN (cyano)\n    *   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n    *   **C5:** -CHO (formyl)\n    *   **C6:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n    This structure satisfies all the conditions described in the problem.\n\n### 2. Determine the IUPAC Name\n\n1.  **Parent Name:** As established, the highest priority group is -COOH, so the parent name is **benzoic acid**, and C1 is assigned to the carbon bearing the -COOH group.\n\n2.  **Numbering:** We need to number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n    *   **Clockwise numbering:** Starting from C1 and going towards C2, the substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise numbering:** Starting from C1 and going towards C6, the substituents are also at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n3.  **Tie-Breaker Rule:** When both numbering directions give the same lowest locant set, we choose the direction that assigns the lowest locants to the substituents cited first in alphabetical order.\n    *   First, list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n        *   **C**yano\n        *   **D**imethylamino\n        *   **F**ormyl\n        *   **H**ydroxy\n        *   **M**ethoxy\n    *   Now, write down the locant series for each numbering direction, following this alphabetical order:\n        *   **Clockwise (C2 is -OH):** cyano is at 3, dimethylamino is at 6, formyl is at 5, hydroxy is at 2, methoxy is at 4. The sequence is **(3, 6, 5, 2, 4)**.\n        *   **Counter-clockwise (C2 is -N(CH3)2):** cyano is at 5, dimethylamino is at 2, formyl is at 3, hydroxy is at 6, methoxy is at 4. The sequence is **(5, 2, 3, 6, 4)**.\n    *   Compare the sequences term by term. At the first term, **3 is lower than 5**. Therefore, the clockwise numbering scheme is correct.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Final Name:** Using the correct (clockwise) numbering, we list the substituents alphabetically with their locants, followed by the parent name.\n    *   Locants: 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino.\n    *   Alphabetical assembly:\n        *   3-cyano-\n        *   6-(dimethylamino)- (parentheses are used for complex substituents)\n        *   5-formyl-\n        *   2-hydroxy-\n        *   4-methoxy\n    *   Putting it all together gives: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 3. Compare with the Options\n\nThe derived name matches option B exactly.\n\nA) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect locants and alphabetical order)\nB) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (**Correct**)\nC) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect locants from wrong tie-breaker choice)\nD) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order of prefixes)\n\n<<<B>>>"
