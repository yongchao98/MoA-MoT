    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (C=O). This strongly suggests the presence of an acetyl group (-C(O)CH3).\n    *   **Splitting (s, singlet):** A singlet means there are no adjacent protons to couple with. This is consistent with an acetyl group.\n    *   **Fragment:** CH3-C(O)-\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, likely a methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, suggesting a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-CH3).\n    *   **Splitting (d, doublet):** A doublet means these three protons are coupled to a single adjacent proton.\n    *   **Fragment:** CH3-CH=\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region, meaning the proton is directly attached to a double bond (-CH=).\n    *   **Splitting (dq, doublet of quartets):** This is a complex splitting pattern. \"Doublet\" means it is coupled to one other proton. \"Quartet\" means it is coupled to three other equivalent protons (a methyl group). This proton must be adjacent to another proton on the double bond AND to a methyl group. This perfectly matches the environment `CH3-CH=`. This signal is for the proton in that fragment.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region (-CH=). Its higher chemical shift compared to the 5.5 ppm signal suggests it is deshielded, likely by an adjacent electronegative atom like oxygen.\n    *   **Splitting (d, doublet):** A doublet means it is coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This value is crucial for determining stereochemistry. Coupling constants between protons across a double bond are stereospecific:\n        *   **J_trans ≈ 12-18 Hz**\n        *   **J_cis ≈ 6-12 Hz**\n    *   The observed value of 16.0 Hz is a classic example of *trans* coupling.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Structure**\n\nWe have the following pieces:\n*   An acetyl group: CH3-C(O)-\n*   A trans-disubstituted double bond: -CH=CH- (where J = 16.0 Hz)\n*   A methyl group attached to the double bond: CH3-CH=\n\nLet's put them together. The structure must be **CH3-CH=CH-O-C(O)-CH3**. This is **propenyl acetate**. Let's verify the assignments:\n*   **H3C-C(O)-:** The acetyl methyl protons. No adjacent protons. -> **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**. Correct.\n*   **H3C-CH=:** The methyl group on the double bond. Coupled to one vinyl proton. -> **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**. Correct.\n*   **CH3-CH=:** The proton on the double bond next to the methyl group. It is coupled to the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the three methyl protons (quartet). -> **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**. Correct.\n*   **=CH-O-:** The proton on the double bond next to the acetate group's oxygen. It is coupled to only one other vinyl proton. The electronegative oxygen deshields it, shifting it downfield. -> **7.0 ppm (1H, d)**. Correct.\n\nThe structure is consistent with propenyl acetate. The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the two vinylic protons confirms the **trans** stereochemistry.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) Cis-butenyl acetate & B) Trans-butenyl acetate:** The butenyl structure (e.g., CH3-CH=CH-CH2-O-C(O)-CH3) contains a CH2 group that is not observed in the spectrum. The splitting patterns would also be different. These are incorrect.\n*   **D) Cis-propenyl acetate:** This would have a small coupling constant (J ≈ 6-12 Hz) for the vinylic protons. The observed J = 16.0 Hz rules this out.\n*   **C) Trans-propenyl acetate:** This structure perfectly matches all aspects of the 1H NMR data: the chemical shifts, the integrations, the splitting patterns, and the trans-coupling constant.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
