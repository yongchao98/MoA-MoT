    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    The core of the question is to compare two different mean free paths within the same physical space (a TEM vacuum chamber) under the same conditions of temperature, pressure, and gas composition.\n    *   **λ1**: The mean free path of the residual *gas molecules* colliding with *each other*.\n    *   **λ2**: The mean free path of the high-energy *electrons* from the beam scattering off the residual *gas molecules*.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The general formula for the mean free path (λ) of a particle moving through a field of target particles is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (molecules/m³).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which is the effective area that a target particle presents to the moving particle for a collision to occur.\n\n3.  **Analyze λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collision):**\n    *   In this case, the moving particles are gas molecules, and the target particles are also gas molecules.\n    *   Because both the moving particle and the target are in motion, a correction factor of `sqrt(2)` is introduced to account for their relative velocities.\n    *   The cross-section, σ₁, is the kinetic cross-section of the gas molecules, which is related to their physical size (diameter `d`). The cross-section is given by σ_kinetic = πd².\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ1 is:\n        **λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * π * d²)**\n\n4.  **Analyze λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule Collision):**\n    *   Here, the moving particles are the high-energy electrons from the microscope's beam, and the target particles are the stationary (relative to the fast electrons) gas molecules.\n    *   The cross-section, σ₂, is the *scattering* cross-section for an electron interacting with a gas molecule (σ_e-gas). This is not determined by the physical \"size\" of the molecule in the same way as gas-gas collisions.\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ2 is:\n        **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas)**\n\n5.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ₁ vs. σ₂):**\n    This is the most critical step. We need to compare the effective cross-section for gas-gas collisions with the scattering cross-section for electron-gas collisions.\n    *   **Gas-Gas Cross-Section (for λ1):** This interaction is between two relatively large, slow-moving objects (the gas molecules). The collision is determined by the repulsion of their outer electron clouds. The effective cross-section `sqrt(2) * π * d²` is relatively large.\n    *   **Electron-Gas Cross-Section (for λ2):** This interaction involves a very small, very high-energy projectile (a 1000 kV electron) and a large target (the gas molecule). Because the electron is so energetic, it can easily penetrate the diffuse electron cloud of the gas molecule without significant interaction. A \"collision\" (i.e., significant scattering) only occurs if the electron passes very close to the dense, positively charged nucleus or has a direct, high-energy exchange with one of the atom's own electrons. This makes the effective target area for scattering much smaller than the physical size of the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is much smaller than the kinetic collision cross-section for two gas molecules.\n        **σ_e-gas << (sqrt(2) * π * d²)**\n\n6.  **Compare the Mean Free Paths (λ1 vs. λ2):**\n    *   We have:\n        λ1 = 1 / (n * [sqrt(2) * π * d²])\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * [σ_e-gas])\n    *   Since the denominators are `n * σ` and we've established that the cross-section term in the denominator of λ2 is much smaller than the cross-section term in the denominator of λ1, it follows that λ2 must be much larger than λ1.\n    *   To put it mathematically:\n        Since `σ_e-gas << sqrt(2) * π * d²`, then `1 / (n * σ_e-gas) >> 1 / (n * sqrt(2) * π * d²)`.\n        Therefore, **λ2 >> λ1**.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation. (Incorrect, physics dictates they are different).\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1. (Incorrect, this implies λ2 is only slightly larger than λ1. Our analysis shows it should be much larger).\n    *   C) λ2 < λ1. (Incorrect, this is the opposite of our finding).\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1. (Correct. This option states that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. Our finding that λ2 >> λ1 strongly supports this inequality. The factor 1.22 is a lower bound that is easily surpassed).\n\n<<<D>>>"
