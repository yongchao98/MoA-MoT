    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State and General Rules\n\n*   **Initial NN State:** The system starts as two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we have `1S0` => `2S_i+1=1`, `L_i=S`, `J_i=0`.\n    *   This gives:\n        *   Initial total spin: `S_i = 0`\n        *   Initial total orbital angular momentum: `L_i = 0`\n        *   Initial total angular momentum: `J_i = 0`\n    *   Initial Parity (`P_i`): The parity of the NN system is `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   Initial Isospin (`T_i`): We use the given Pauli statistics rule: `T = S + L + 1 (mod 2)`.\n        *   `T_i = S_i + L_i + 1 (mod 2) = 0 + 0 + 1 (mod 2) = 1`.\n        *   So, the initial state has isospin `T_i = 1`.\n\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic Parity: `P_X = -1` (given).\n    *   Orbital angular momentum: `l_X` (denoted by s, p, d, f...).\n    *   Spin: `S_X`. This is not given. We'll assume it can take any value required to conserve angular momentum, unless a specific value is forced.\n\n*   **Final NN State:**\n    *   Isospin: `T_{f,NN} = 0` (given).\n    *   The state is described by `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n    *   Parity: `P_{f,NN} = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n\n### 2. Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nWe must check each potential reaction against conservation laws and the given Pauli rule.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum must be conserved. `J_i = J_{final_total}`.\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum (`J_f`), the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`), and the spin of particle X (`S_X`): `vec{J}_{final_total} = vec{J}_f + vec{l}_X + vec{S}_X`.\n    *   So, we must have `vec{J}_f + vec{l}_X + vec{S}_X = 0`. This implies that a valid (integer or half-integer) spin `S_X` must exist that satisfies the vector sum. This is possible if `|J_f - l_X| <= S_X <= J_f + l_X`. In the special case where `vec{J}_f + vec{l}_X = 0`, then `S_X` must be 0. More commonly in such problems, a simplifying assumption that particle X is spinless (`S_X=0`) is made. This simplifies the condition to `vec{J}_f + vec{l}_X = 0`, which means their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`. Let's test this simpler condition first.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity must be conserved. `P_i = P_{final}`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   `P_{final} = P_{f,NN} * P_X * (-1)^{l_X}` (Parity of final NN state * intrinsic parity of X * orbital parity of X).\n    *   `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   `+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`.\n    *   This simplifies to `(-1)^{L_f + l_X} = -1`.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n3.  **Pauli Statistics for Final State:** The rule `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)` must hold for the final NN state.\n    *   We are given `T_{f,NN} = 0`.\n    *   `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies `S_f + L_f = -1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to `S_f + L_f = 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Options\n\nLet's check each option against these three constraints.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = l_X`? `3 = 3`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X` = odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f` = odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = l_X`? `0 = 0`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X` = odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f` = odd? `1 + 1 = 2` (Even). **This violates the condition.**\n*   The final NN state `3P0` has `S+L = 2` (even), which requires it to have isospin `T=1` according to the rule. The problem requires the final state to have `T=0`. Thus, this transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` => `S_f = 3`.\n*   This state is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Each nucleon has spin 1/2. Their total spin can only be `S = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1` (triplet state) or `S = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0` (singlet state). `S=3` cannot be formed.\n*   Because the proposed final state cannot exist, the transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X` = odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f` = odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have found two \"not permitted\" transitions: B and C.\n*   **C** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is impossible for two nucleons (`S_f` cannot be 3). This is a violation of the fundamental properties of the NN system.\n*   **B** is forbidden because the final NN state (`3P0`) has `S_f+L_f=2` (even), which according to the provided Pauli rule, must have `T=1`. This contradicts the given condition that `T_{f,NN}=0`. This violation is a direct application of the rules the question instructed to use.\n\nIn physics problems of this type, one is typically expected to apply the given process rules (conservation laws, specific principles like the Pauli rule) to the options. The violation in option B is a failure to satisfy the Pauli statistics rule for the required isospin, which is one of the specific rules to be checked. The issue in option C is with the definition of the state itself, which is arguably a more fundamental error but might be a typo in the question. Given the explicit instruction to use the Pauli statistics rule, the violation found in option B is the most direct and intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
