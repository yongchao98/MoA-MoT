    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is most commonly a substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (-COO-) is present. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the given formula options. The ester also contains a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring with two proton signals suggests a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern. This pattern has high symmetry, resulting in two sets of chemically equivalent protons (an AA'BB' system, often appearing as two doublets). This accounts for 4 aromatic protons (`C6H4`).\n        *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals, 1 doublet, 1 doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The proton on the carbon attached to the ring would be coupled only to the other vinyl proton, appearing as a doublet. The other vinyl proton would be coupled to the first vinyl proton (making it a doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (making it a quartet). The combined splitting pattern is a doublet of quartets. This accounts for the `C3H5` fragment `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n        *   **–CH3 (2 signals):** One methyl signal comes from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). Since there are two methyl signals in total, the second one must be part of the ester group.\n        *   **No –CH2 signals:** This is a critical constraint. The second methyl group in the ester must be attached directly to the oxygen or carbonyl carbon, meaning the ester is either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate ester (`-OCOCH3`). An ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`) or similar would show a `-CH2` signal.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The DoU represents the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    From the spectroscopic data, we can identify the following contributions to unsaturation:\n    *   Benzene ring: 1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 DoU\n    *   Ester group (C=O): 1 double bond = 1 DoU\n    *   Vinyl group (C=C): 1 double bond = 1 DoU\n    *   **Total required DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.**\n\n    Now, let's calculate the DoU for each of the given options using the formula `DoU = C - H/2 + 1` (for a formula CnHmO2).\n    ```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula_str):\n    import re\n    counts = {'C': 0, 'H': 0}\n    parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z])(\\d+)', formula_str)\n    for element, count in parts:\n        counts[element] = int(count)\n    C = counts['C']\n    H = counts['H']\n    dou = C - H / 2 + 1\n    return int(dou)\n\nformulas = {\n    \"A\": \"C11H12O2\",\n    \"B\": \"C12H12O2\",\n    \"C\": \"C11H14O2\",\n    \"D\": \"C12H14O2\"\n}\n\nprint(\"Calculation of Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each option:\")\nfor option, formula in formulas.items():\n    dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n    print(f\"Option {option}) {formula}: DoU = {dou}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nRequired DoU from spectral data is 6.\")\n\n```\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options based on DoU:**\n    *   **A) C11H12O2:** DoU = 6. This matches the required DoU.\n    *   **B) C12H12O2:** DoU = 7. This implies an extra ring or double bond, which is inconsistent with the simple NMR spectrum described. This option is unlikely.\n    *   **C) C11H14O2:** DoU = 5. This is less than the required DoU of 6, meaning it's impossible to have a benzene ring, an ester, and a vinyl group all at once. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **D) C12H14O2:** DoU = 6. This matches the required DoU.\n\n4.  **Assemble the structure and compare C11H12O2 and C12H14O2:**\n    We are left with options A and D. Let's build the molecule from the fragments identified in step 1.\n    *   Aromatic ring: `C6H4`\n    *   Propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3` which is `C3H5`\n    *   Ester group: `-COOCH3` (methyl ester) which is `C2H3O2`\n\n    Let's sum the atoms of these fragments:\n    *   Carbon: 6 (from `C6H4`) + 3 (from `C3H5`) + 2 (from `C2H3O2`) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   Hydrogen: 4 (from `C6H4`) + 5 (from `C3H5`) + 3 (from `C2H3O2`) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   Oxygen: 2 (from `C2H3O2`) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n    The total formula derived directly from the spectral data is **C11H12O2**. This perfectly matches option A. A possible structure is Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate, which fits all the data.\n\n    Now consider option D) **C12H14O2**. To get this formula from C11H12O2, one must add a `CH2` unit. Any attempt to add a `CH2` group to the proposed structure (e.g., making the ester an ethyl ester, `–COOCH2CH3`) would introduce a `-CH2` signal in the NMR spectrum. However, the problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups**. Therefore, C12H14O2 is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data (FTIR, 1H NMR, and particularly the degree of unsaturation and the absence of -CH2- signals) is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the number of rings and pi bonds. We can deduce the required DoU from the structural information provided:\n    *   A 6-membered aromatic ring has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, so its DoU is 4.\n    *   An ester group contains a carbonyl (C=O) double bond, contributing 1 to the DoU.\n    *   The NMR spectrum shows two vinyl hydrogens, indicating the presence of a C=C double bond, which contributes 1 to the DoU.\n    *   Therefore, the total required Degree of Unsaturation for the molecule is 4 (ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = **6**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the DoU for each formula option:**\n    The formula for DoU is `C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`, where C, H, and N are the number of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen atoms, respectively. For a formula CₓHᵧO₂, this simplifies to `DoU = x - y/2 + 1`. The python script has already performed this calculation:\n    *   **A) C11H12O2:** DoU = 11 - 12/2 + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = **6**\n    *   **B) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 - 12/2 + 1 = 12 - 6 + 1 = 7\n    *   **C) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 - 14/2 + 1 = 11 - 7 + 1 = 5\n    *   **D) C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 - 14/2 + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = **6**\n\n    Based on the DoU calculation, we can eliminate options B and C, as their DoU does not match the required value of 6. We are left with options A (C11H12O2) and D (C12H14O2).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure from NMR Data:** Now we use the detailed ¹H NMR information to build the molecule's fragments and determine the atom count.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The spectrum shows two signals for aromatic protons. This is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring, which has the formula **-C₆H₄-**.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The presence of two vinyl proton signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) along with one of the methyl signals strongly suggests a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **-C₃H₅**.\n    *   **Ester and Second Methyl Group:** The FTIR confirms an ester group (-COO-). The NMR shows a second -CH₃ signal and importantly, **no -CH₂- signals**. This means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or anything larger. It must be a **methyl ester (-COOCH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **-C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n4.  **Sum the Atoms of the Fragments:** Let's add up the atoms from the fragments we identified:\n    *   **Carbons:** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygens:** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** The assembled structure directly from the spectroscopic evidence gives a chemical formula of **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This matches option A. A structure corresponding to C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (Option D) would require an additional -CH₂- unit, which would produce a -CH₂- signal in the NMR spectrum, contradicting the given information.\n\n<<<A>>>"
