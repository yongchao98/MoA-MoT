    "Here is my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2 (M1_total / M2_total).\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   RV Amplitude 1 (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   RV Amplitude 2 (K1b) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   RV Amplitude 1 (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   RV Amplitude 2 (K2b) = 10 km/s\n    *   **Crucial Clue:** Both systems are \"eclipsing\". This implies that we are viewing the orbits edge-on. In astronomical terms, the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90 degrees, so we can assume `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n\n3.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Formula:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass (m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1, K2) by the following formula, which is derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n\n    `M_total = m1 + m2 = (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³ / sin³(i)`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `M_total` is the total mass of the system.\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `K1` and `K2` are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n    *   `i` is the inclination angle of the orbit.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Formula for a Ratio Calculation:**\n    *   We need to find the ratio `M1_total / M2_total`.\n    *   `M1_total = (P1 / (2πG)) * (K1a + K1b)³ / sin³(i1)`\n    *   `M2_total = (P2 / (2πG)) * (K2a + K2b)³ / sin³(i2)`\n    *   When we take the ratio `M1 / M2`, the constant term `1 / (2πG)` will cancel out.\n    *   Since both systems are eclipsing, we assume `sin(i1) ≈ 1` and `sin(i2) ≈ 1`. So, the `sin³(i)` terms also cancel or are equal to 1.\n    *   This leaves a much simpler proportionality:\n        `M_total ∝ P * (K_a + K_b)³`\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio Calculation:**\n    `M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]`\n\n6.  **Plug in the values:**\n    *   For System 1: `P1 = 2` years, `K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`.\n    *   For System 2: `P2 = 1` year, `K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`.\n    *   Note: Since we are calculating a ratio, we don't need to convert units to SI (e.g., years to seconds) as long as we are consistent. The units will cancel out.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Result:**\n    *   `M1 / M2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n    *   `M1 / M2 = (2 * 15 * 15 * 15) / (25 * 25 * 25)`\n    *   `M1 / M2 = (2 * 3375) / (15625)`\n    *   `M1 / M2 = 6750 / 15625`\n\n8.  **Perform the final division.** To make this easier, I will use a python script.\n\n```python\n# Data for System 1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1_sum = 10.0 + 5.0 # km/s\n\n# Data for System 2\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2_sum = 15.0 + 10.0 # km/s\n\n# The total mass M is proportional to P * (K_sum)^3\n# The constants of proportionality cancel out in the ratio.\nratio = (P1 * (K1_sum)**3) / (P2 * (K2_sum)**3)\n\nprint(ratio)\n```\nEXECUTE\n\nINTERPRETER OUTPUT\n0.432\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated ratio is 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\n    *   A) ~ 0.7\n    *   B) ~ 0.4\n    *   C) ~ 1.2\n    *   D) ~ 0.6\n\n    The value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The total mass `M` of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system is given by Kepler's Third Law in the following form:\n`M_total = m1 + m2 = P * (K1 + K2)³ / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n\nwhere:\n- `P` is the orbital period.\n- `K1` and `K2` are the amplitudes of the radial velocity curves of the two stars.\n- `G` is the gravitational constant.\n- `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing\". This implies that we are viewing the orbits edge-on, so the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90 degrees. For `i = 90°`, `sin(i) = 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) = 1`.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the mass of system 1 (`M1`) to the mass of system 2 (`M2`).\n\n`M1 / M2 = [ P1 * (K1a + K1b)³ / (2πG * sin³(i1)) ] / [ P2 * (K2a + K2b)³ / (2πG * sin³(i2)) ]`\n\nSince `sin(i1) ≈ 1`, `sin(i2) ≈ 1`, and the term `(2πG)` is a constant, they cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n`M1 / M2 = [ P1 * (K1a + K1b)³ ] / [ P2 * (K2a + K2b)³ ]`\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n\n**For system_1:**\n- `P1 = 2` years\n- `K1a = 10` km/s\n- `K1b = 5` km/s\n- `(K1a + K1b) = 10 + 5 = 15` km/s\n\n**For system_2:**\n- `P2 = 1` year\n- `K2a = 15` km/s\n- `K2b = 10` km/s\n- `(K2a + K2b) = 15 + 10 = 25` km/s\n\nNow, we calculate the ratio:\n`M1 / M2 = [ 2 * (15)³ ] / [ 1 * (25)³ ]`\n`M1 / M2 = (2 * 3375) / (15625)`\n`M1 / M2 = 6750 / 15625`\n`M1 / M2 = 0.432`\n\nThe calculated ratio is 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.7\nB) ~ 0.4\nC) ~ 1.2\nD) ~ 0.6\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
