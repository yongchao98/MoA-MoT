    "To determine which stars can be observed by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must check two main criteria for each star:\n1.  **Location (Declination):** The star must be visible from both the Paranal Observatory in the Southern Hemisphere (Chile, latitude approx. -24.6°) and the Keck Observatory in the Northern Hemisphere (Hawaii, latitude approx. +19.8°). Stars with very high positive or negative declinations are not visible from the opposite hemisphere. However, the problem states to disregard pointing limits, so we will focus primarily on the magnitude constraint, which is a hard limit.\n2.  **Brightness (Apparent Magnitude):** The star's apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the limits of both instruments.\n    *   ESPRESSO limit: V < 17 mag\n    *   HIRES limit: V < 16 mag\n    *   Therefore, for a star to be observable by **both**, it must satisfy the stricter condition: **V < 16 mag**.\n\nWe will calculate the apparent V magnitude (denoted as V or m) for each star where it is not directly provided. The formula that connects apparent magnitude (m), absolute magnitude (M), distance in parsecs (d), and interstellar absorption (Aᵥ) is:\n`m = M + 5 * log₁₀(d) - 5 + Aᵥ`\nWhere `Aᵥ = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\nLet's analyze each star:\n\n**Star 1**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = -75°. A star this far south is not visible from the Keck Observatory in Hawaii.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 2**\n*   **Apparent V magnitude:** V = 16.5 mag.\n*   **Brightness Check:** This magnitude (16.5) is fainter than the HIRES limit of 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by HIRES, and therefore cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 3**\n*   **Apparent V magnitude:** V = 15.5 mag (given directly).\n*   **Brightness Check:** This magnitude (15.5) is brighter than the limit of 16 mag.\n*   **Declination:** DEC = +48°. This is visible from both hemispheres.\n*   **Conclusion:** Observable by both instruments.\n\n**Star 4**\n*   **Absolute V magnitude (M):** 15.5 mag\n*   **Distance (d):** 10 pc\n*   **Color Excess (E(B-V)):** 0.4 mag\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Calculate absorption: Aᵥ = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n    2.  Calculate apparent magnitude: m = 15.5 + 5 * log₁₀(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n*   **Brightness Check:** The calculated apparent magnitude (16.74) is fainter than the HIRES limit of 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by HIRES, and therefore cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 5**\n*   **Absolute V magnitude (M):** 16.5 mag\n*   **Distance (d):** 5 pc\n*   **Color Excess (E(B-V)):** Not given, assume 0. So, Aᵥ = 0.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Calculate apparent magnitude: m = 16.5 + 5 * log₁₀(5) - 5 + 0 ≈ 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 ≈ 14.995 mag.\n*   **Brightness Check:** The calculated apparent magnitude (~15.0) is brighter than the limit of 16 mag.\n*   **Declination:** DEC = +60°. This is visible from both hemispheres.\n*   **Conclusion:** Observable by both instruments.\n\nBased on this analysis, only **Star 3** and **Star 5** meet the criteria for being observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef check_stars():\n    # Observatory Magnitude Limits (strictest one matters for 'both')\n    limit_hires = 16.0\n\n    # Star 1: Fails on location (DEC = -75 deg, not visible from Keck)\n    print(\"Star 1: Not observable by both (location).\")\n\n    # Star 2: Given V = 16.5\n    v2 = 16.5\n    if v2 < limit_hires:\n        print(\"Star 2: Observable by both.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Star 2: Not observable by both (V={v2} is not < {limit_hires}).\")\n\n    # Star 3: Given V = 15.5\n    v3 = 15.5\n    if v3 < limit_hires:\n        print(\"Star 3: Observable by both.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Star 3: Not observable by both (V={v3} is not < {limit_hires}).\")\n\n    # Star 4: Calculate V\n    # m = M + 5*log10(d) - 5 + A_V\n    # A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)\n    A_v4 = 3.1 * 0.4\n    v4 = 15.5 + 5 * math.log10(10) - 5 + A_v4\n    if v4 < limit_hires:\n        print(\"Star 4: Observable by both.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Star 4: Not observable by both (Calculated V={v4:.2f} is not < {limit_hires}).\")\n\n    # Star 5: Calculate V\n    v5 = 16.5 + 5 * math.log10(5) - 5 + 0\n    if v5 < limit_hires:\n        print(f\"Star 5: Observable by both (Calculated V={v5:.2f} is < {limit_hires}).\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Star 5: Not observable by both.\")\n\nprint(\"Analyzing which stars can be seen by BOTH ESPRESSO (V<17) and HIRES (V<16).\")\nprint(\"This means the star must have an apparent magnitude V < 16.\\n\")\ncheck_stars()\n```\nStar 1: Not observable by both (location).\nStar 2: Not observable by both (V=16.5 is not < 16.0).\nStar 3: Observable by both.\nStar 4: Not observable by both (Calculated V=16.74 is not < 16.0).\nStar 5: Observable by both (Calculated V=15.00 is < 16.0).\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "To determine which stars can be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES, we need to check two conditions for each star:\n1.  **Visibility:** The star must be observable from both the Paranal Observatory in Chile (Southern Hemisphere, latitude ~-24.6°) and the Keck Observatory in Hawaii (Northern Hemisphere, latitude ~+19.8°). Stars with declinations between roughly -65° and +70° are visible from both sites. The problem statement asks us to disregard the pointing limits, which simplifies this check, but extreme declinations can still make a star impossible to observe from one hemisphere.\n2.  **Brightness:** The star's apparent magnitude (V) must be brighter than the observational limit of both instruments.\n    *   ESPRESSO limit: V < 17 mag\n    *   HIRES limit: V < 16 mag\n    *   To be seen by **both**, the star must meet the stricter requirement: **V < 16 mag**.\n\nWe will calculate the apparent magnitude (m or V) for any star where it's not directly given, using the distance modulus formula: `m = M + 5 * log₁₀(d) - 5 + Aᵥ`, where M is the absolute magnitude, d is the distance in parsecs, and Aᵥ is the interstellar absorption (`Aᵥ = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\nLet's evaluate each star:\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **Visibility:** Declination is -75°. This is too far south to be visible from Keck Observatory in the Northern Hemisphere. Thus, it cannot be observed by both.\n    *   **Brightness:** M = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc. Since the distance is 10 pc, the apparent magnitude is equal to the absolute magnitude, so V = 15.5 mag. While this is bright enough (15.5 < 16), the star is not visible from both locations.\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   **Visibility:** Declination is +55°. This is visible from both hemispheres.\n    *   **Brightness:** The apparent V magnitude is given as 16.5 mag. This is fainter than the HIRES limit of 16 mag (16.5 is not < 16). Therefore, it cannot be observed by both.\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   **Visibility:** Declination is +48°. This is visible from both hemispheres.\n    *   **Brightness:** The apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5 mag. This is brighter than the limit of 16 mag (15.5 < 16). Therefore, **Star 3 is observable by both**.\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   **Visibility:** Declination is -48°. This is visible from both hemispheres.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   Absolute magnitude M = 15.5 mag\n        *   Distance d = 10 pc\n        *   Absorption Aᵥ = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n        *   Apparent magnitude V = M + 5*log₁₀(d) - 5 + Aᵥ = 15.5 + 5*log₁₀(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**.\n        *   This magnitude (16.74) is fainter than the 16 mag limit. Therefore, it cannot be observed by both.\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   **Visibility:** Declination is +60°. This is visible from both hemispheres.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   Absolute magnitude M = 16.5 mag\n        *   Distance d = 5 pc\n        *   Absorption Aᵥ = 0 (not given, so assumed to be negligible).\n        *   Apparent magnitude V = M + 5*log₁₀(d) - 5 + Aᵥ = 16.5 + 5*log₁₀(5) - 5 + 0 ≈ 16.5 + 5*(0.699) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = **14.995 mag**.\n        *   This magnitude (~15.0) is brighter than the 16 mag limit (15.0 < 16). Therefore, **Star 5 is observable by both**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOnly Star 3 and Star 5 can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n<<<A>>>"
