    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify Substance X**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"**\n        This immediately suggests that Substance X contains an element with a common, stable heavy isotope. The most frequent examples in chemistry are Deuterium (D or ²H), which is a heavy isotope of Hydrogen, and Carbon-13 (¹³C).\n\n    *   **Clue 2: \"...reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"**\n        A violent reaction suggests a highly reactive substance, such as a strong reducing agent or a reactive metal hydride. Let's examine potential gases (W) where the total number of protons (p) equals the total number of neutrons (n):\n        *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** A molecule of D₂ consists of two Deuterium atoms (²H). Each has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Total: p=2, n=2. This fits the criterion and strongly supports the idea that X is a deuterated compound.\n        *   **¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas):** Each nitrogen atom has 7p and 7n. Total: p=14, n=14. This fits, but it's harder to connect to the other clues.\n        *   **CD₄ (Deuteromethane):** Composed of ¹²C (6p, 6n) and four D atoms (1p, 1n each). Total: p = 6 + 4(1) = 10; n = 6 + 4(1) = 10. This is also a possibility.\n        Let's proceed with the D₂ hypothesis as it is the simplest and most direct consequence of a deuterated substance reacting. For a reaction to release pure D₂ gas, a deuteride (Substance X) would need to react with a deuterated solvent (Liquid Y), like heavy water (D₂O).\n\n    *   **Let's form a hypothesis:**\n        *   Substance X is a deuteride salt. A very common one is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**.\n        *   Liquid Y is heavy water, **D₂O**.\n        *   Gas W is **D₂**.\n        *   The reaction would be: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n        This reaction is violent, produces D₂ gas (p=n), and forms a precipitate, Aluminum Deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). This fits perfectly so far.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: \"...a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n        From our hypothesis, the precipitate G is **Al(OD)₃**. When metal hydroxides (or deuteroxides) are heated, they decompose to form the metal oxide and water (or heavy water).\n        *   Reaction: `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`.\n        *   So, substance B is **D₂O**.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This value is indeed \"very close to 277 K\". This provides strong confirmation for our hypothesis.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n        LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent. A keto acid possesses two functional groups that can be reduced: a ketone (`-C=O`) and a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`). LiAlD₄ reduces a ketone to a secondary alcohol (`-CD(OH)-`) and a carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol (`-CD₂(OH)`). Therefore, the reaction product would be a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This clue is also satisfied.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"**\n        LiAlD₄ (Substance X) is used in organic synthesis, particularly for isotopic labeling. Its \"very close analog\" is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (**LiAlH₄**), which is one of the most common and powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry. This clue fits perfectly.\n\n2.  **Conclusion on Identity**\n    All clues consistently point to Substance X being **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation**\n    The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in LiAlD₄.\n\n    *   **Elements present:**\n        *   Lithium (Li), Atomic number Z=3\n        *   Aluminum (Al), Atomic number Z=13\n        *   Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D), Atomic number Z=1\n    *   **Lightest and Heaviest:**\n        *   Lightest element (by Z) is Hydrogen.\n        *   Heaviest element (by Z) is Aluminum.\n    *   **Mass Calculation:** We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We will use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes present.\n        *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D), which is ²H. Mass number = 2.\n        *   The most abundant isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al. Mass number = 27.\n        *   The formula is LiAlD₄. There is 1 atom of Aluminum and 4 atoms of Deuterium.\n    *   **Summation:**\n        *   Total mass from heaviest element (Aluminum) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n        *   Total mass from lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Cumulative mass = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
