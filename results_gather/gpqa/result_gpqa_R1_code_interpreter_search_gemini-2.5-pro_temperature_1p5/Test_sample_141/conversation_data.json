    "The state of a qubit can be represented as a point in a 3D space called the Bloch sphere. This representation is given by the Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$. The relationship between a density matrix $\\rho$ and its Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ is given by the formula:\n\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nwhere:\n*   $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix: $I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices:\n    *   $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe components of the Bloch vector can be calculated from the density matrix using the formula:\n$r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$, where $k \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$.\n\nLet's first express the given density matrix in its matrix form. The basis states are:\n$\\left|0\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\left|1\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe outer products are:\n$\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSubstituting these into the given expression for $\\rho$:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}I$\n\nThis is the density matrix for a maximally mixed state, which means there is an equal probability of measuring the qubit in state $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$.\n\nNow, we can find the components of the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}=(r_x, r_y, r_z)$.\n\n**Method 1: Direct comparison**\nWe compare our density matrix $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$ with the general form $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$.\n$\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n$I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\nSubtracting $I$ from both sides gives:\n$\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = 0$ (the zero matrix)\n\nThis implies that $r_x \\sigma_x + r_y \\sigma_y + r_z \\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\begin{pmatrix} r_z & r_x - ir_y \\\\ r_x + ir_y & -r_z \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\nFor this equality to hold, all components must be zero:\n$r_z = 0$\n$r_x - ir_y = 0 \\implies r_x=0, r_y=0$\n$r_x + ir_y = 0 \\implies r_x=0, r_y=0$\nThus, the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**Method 2: Using the trace formula**\n$r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0$\n$r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0$\n$r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(1-1) = 0$\n\nBoth methods give the result $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. This position represents the center of the Bloch sphere.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) r=(0,0,0)\nB) r=(1,1,1)\nC) r=(0,0,1)\nD) r=(1,1,0)\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
