    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the uncertainty in the operator $P_z$, denoted by $\\Delta P_z$, for a system in a given quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$. The uncertainty is defined by the formula:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\nFirst, let's identify the given quantities:\n1.  The state vector of the system: $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is a column vector.\n2.  The matrix representation of the operator $P_z$: $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe calculation proceeds in three steps:\n1.  Calculate the expectation value of $P_z$, denoted as $\\langle P_z \\rangle$.\n2.  Calculate the expectation value of $P_z^2$, denoted as $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.\n3.  Substitute these values into the uncertainty formula.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n\nThe expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle$.\nThe bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$ is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all components of $|\\psi\\rangle$ are real, it is just the transpose:\n$\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the action of the operator $P_z$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) + 0 \\cdot (1/\\sqrt{2}) + 0 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\cdot (-1/2) + 0 \\cdot (1/\\sqrt{2}) + 0 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\cdot (-1/2) + 0 \\cdot (1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-\\hbar) \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nNow, we compute the inner product of $\\langle\\psi|$ with $P_z|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\n\nFirst, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe expectation value is $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$.\nFirst, compute $P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2(-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nNow, compute the inner product of $\\langle\\psi|$ with $P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\n\nNow we substitute the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) $\\hbar$\nB) $\\sqrt{2}\\hbar$\nC) $\\hbar/2$\nD) $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$\n\nOur result matches option D.\n\nThe additional information that the system is in an eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ and the specific forms of $P_x$ and $P_y$ serve to define the state $|\\psi\\rangle$. As the state vector is explicitly given, we did not need to derive it from that information, but it is consistent with the problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>"
