Identify the Starting Material and its Features**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. To understand the reaction, we must identify all its functional groups and points of unsaturation.\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene ring**: This is a six-membered carbon ring that contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). A ring structure itself counts as one degree of unsaturation.\n*   **Carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**: This functional group contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n*   **Formyl group (-CHO)**: This is an aldehyde group, which also contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n*   **Vinyl group (-CH=CH₂)**: This substituent contains another carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents and the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This combination is known in organic chemistry as one of the most powerful reducing agents. Its function is to perform a complete reduction of various functional groups down to a saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   Crucially, it does not break open stable cycloalkane rings.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction will reduce all the double bonds and oxygen-containing groups in the starting molecule, but it will not change the total number of carbon atoms or break the ring.\n*   The C=C bond inside the cyclohexene ring is reduced, forming a **cyclohexane** ring.\n*   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group is reduced, and the group becomes a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The C=O bond in the formyl group is reduced, and the group becomes a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The C=C bond in the vinyl group is reduced, and the group becomes an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a fully saturated molecule, meaning it contains only single bonds, but it still possesses a ring structure.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Number of Rings**: The product retains the six-membered ring from the starting material. So, the number of rings is **1**.\n*   **Number of Pi Bonds**: The powerful reduction eliminates all C=C and C=O double bonds. Therefore, the number of pi bonds in the product is **0**.\n\nThe IHD of the product is calculated as:\nIHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of Pi Bonds)\nIHD = 1 + 0 = **1**\n\n**Alternative Calculation using Molecular Formula:**\n*   The starting material has 10 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 1 in -COOH, 1 in -CHO, 2 in the vinyl group).\n*   The product, being a saturated monocyclic alkane, follows the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Since the product has 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n*   Using the IHD formula for a hydrocarbon (IHD = C + 1 - H/2):\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1. This value corresponds to the single ring in the molecule's structure.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Structural Features contributing to Hydrogen Deficiency:**\n    *   One ring (the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   One carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring.\n    *   One carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the vinyl group.\n    *   One carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O) in the formyl (aldehyde) group.\n    *   One carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O) in the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD):** The IHD of the starting material is the sum of its rings and pi bonds, which is 1 (ring) + 4 (pi bonds) = 5. This corresponds to option A, but the question asks for the IHD of the *product*.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + excess HI).\n*   **Function:** This combination is one of the most powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry. It is known for the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds.\n*   **Transformations:**\n    *   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n    *   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n    *   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   The ring structure itself is not broken by this reaction.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Structure**\n\n*   The reaction will reduce all the double bonds (both C=C and C=O) in the starting molecule.\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a saturated cyclohexane ring.\n*   The vinyl group becomes an ethyl group.\n*   The formyl group becomes a methyl group.\n*   The carboxylic acid group becomes a methyl group.\n*   The final product is a fully saturated, substituted cyclohexane. It contains only single bonds and one ring.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD is calculated as the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   **Number of rings:** The product retains the single cyclohexane ring, so there is **1** ring.\n*   **Number of pi bonds:** All double bonds were reduced to single bonds, so there are **0** pi bonds.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for pi bonds) = **1**.\n\n**Alternative Calculation using Molecular Formula:**\n*   The starting material has 10 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 1 in -COOH, 1 in -CHO, 2 in the vinyl group).\n*   The reduction does not change the number of carbon atoms.\n*   The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane) with 10 carbons. The general formula for such a compound is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is therefore C₁₀H₂₀.\n*   Using the IHD formula (IHD = C + 1 - H/2):\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Starting Material and its Features**\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. To understand the reaction, we must identify all features that contribute to its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), which is a measure of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n*   **Ring:** It has one six-membered ring (the `cyclohex` part). This contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Pi Bonds (π bonds):**\n    *   One C=C double bond in the ring (`-3-ene`).\n    *   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group (`-CH=CH₂`).\n    *   One C=O double bond in the formyl group (`-CHO`).\n    *   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`).\n*   The IHD of the starting material is the sum of these features: 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = 5.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Reagents**\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus and excess of HI**. This combination is known as a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key function is to perform complete reduction:\n*   It reduces oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to their corresponding alkane parts (in this case, methyl groups, -CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It does not break the stable carbon ring structure.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Final Product**\nThe reaction will reduce all the double bonds and oxygen-containing groups but will leave the carbon skeleton and the ring intact.\n*   The C=C bond in the ring is reduced to a C-C bond.\n*   The C=C bond in the vinyl group is reduced, turning it into an ethyl group.\n*   The C=O bond in the formyl group is removed, reducing it to a methyl group.\n*   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group is removed, reducing it to a methyl group.\n\nThe final product is a **saturated substituted cyclohexane**. It is a molecule that contains only single bonds and one ring.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\nThe IHD is the sum of rings and π bonds in the final product.\n*   **Number of rings:** The cyclohexane ring remains. So, there is **1** ring.\n*   **Number of π bonds:** All double bonds (both C=C and C=O) were reduced to single bonds. So, there are **0** π bonds.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for π bonds) = **1**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis consistently shows that the reaction reduces all pi bonds but preserves the single ring structure. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the final product is 1. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure and properties of the starting material.**\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to identify all sources of unsaturation (rings and pi bonds), which contribute to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered ring (contributes 1 to IHD) with one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) inside the ring (contributes 1 to IHD).\n*   **carboxylic acid**: This is a -COOH group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O) (contributes 1 to IHD).\n*   **formyl**: This is a -CHO group (an aldehyde), which also contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O) (contributes 1 to IHD).\n*   **vinyl**: This is a -CH=CH₂ group, which contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) (contributes 1 to IHD).\n\nSumming these up, the IHD of the starting material is 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (acid C=O) + 1 (aldehyde C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 5. This matches option A, but the question asks for the IHD of the *product*.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction and the effect of the reagents.**\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is known for its ability to completely reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   The reaction does not break the stable ring structure.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the final product.**\nThe reaction will cause the following transformations on the starting material:\n*   The C=C double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, forming a **cyclohexane** ring.\n*   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group is reduced, converting it to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂-CH₃).\n*   The C=O double bond in the formyl group is reduced, and the entire group becomes a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group is reduced, and the entire group becomes a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a fully saturated molecule. It is a substituted cyclohexane, meaning it has a ring structure but no double or triple bonds.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\nThe IHD is calculated as the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   **Number of rings**: The cyclohexane ring remains intact. So, there is **1** ring.\n*   **Number of pi bonds**: All the C=C and C=O double bonds were reduced to single bonds by the reaction. So, there are **0** pi bonds.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the final product is 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for pi bonds) = **1**.\n\nThis can be confirmed by determining the molecular formula. The starting material has 10 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 1 in COOH, 1 in CHO, 2 in vinyl). The product, being a saturated monocyclic alkane with 10 carbons, will have the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, which is C₁₀H₂₀.\nUsing the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to identify all sources of unsaturation, which contribute to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).\n*   **`cyclohex-3-ene`**: This is a six-membered ring, which counts as one degree of unsaturation. It also contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which is a second degree of unsaturation.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` (-COOH)**: This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which is a third degree of unsaturation.\n*   **`formyl` (-CHO)**: This is an aldehyde group, which also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), a fourth degree of unsaturation.\n*   **`vinyl` (-CH=CH₂)**: This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), a fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\nSo, the IHD of the starting material is 1 (ring) + 4 (pi bonds) = 5.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key characteristic is the complete reduction of most functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) forms.\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It does not break the stable ring structure.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nThe reaction will reduce all the sites of unsaturation identified in Step 1, except for the ring itself.\n*   The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group is reduced, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   The C=O double bond in the formyl group is reduced (the group becomes -CH₃).\n*   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group is reduced (the group becomes -CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a **saturated substituted cyclohexane**. All the pi (π) bonds have been eliminated.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD is calculated as the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   **Number of rings**: The cyclohexane ring remains intact. So, the number of rings is **1**.\n*   **Number of pi bonds**: As established in Step 3, all double bonds (both C=C and C=O) are reduced to single bonds. So, the number of pi bonds is **0**.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the final product is:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\nThis result is consistent across all the provided answers that performed the analysis correctly. The IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring in the final saturated product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to identify all features that contribute to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered ring, which counts as 1 unit of IHD. It also contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which is another unit of IHD.\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This functional group contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which is one unit of IHD.\n*   **formyl (-CHO)**: This functional group contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which is one unit of IHD.\n*   **vinyl (-CH=CH₂)**: This functional group contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which is one unit of IHD.\n\nSumming these up, the IHD of the starting material is: 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = **5**. This matches option C, but the question asks for the IHD of the *product*.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI**. This combination is one of the most powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry. Its function is to reduce various functional groups completely to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) forms.\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It does not break the stable cycloalkane ring structure.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product**\nThe reaction will cause the following transformations:\n*   The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, forming a **cyclohexane** ring.\n*   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid is reduced, and the group becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The C=O double bond in the formyl group is reduced, and the group becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group is reduced, and the group becomes an **ethyl group**.\n\nThe final product is a saturated, substituted cyclohexane.

So, there is **1** ring.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: All C=C and C=O double bonds were reduced to single bonds. So, there are **0** π bonds.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the final product is 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for π bonds) = **1**.\n\n**Alternative Calculation using Molecular Formula:**\n1.  **Formula of Starting Material:** The carbon count is 6 (ring) + 1 (acid) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 carbons. The formula is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n2.  **Formula of Product:** The reduction preserves the 10-carbon skeleton but removes all oxygens and saturates all bonds. The product is a monocyclic alkane (cycloalkane). The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. For n=10, the product's formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n3.  **IHD of Product:** Using the formula IHD = C + 1 - (H/2), for C₁₀H₂₀:\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.

Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. To understand the reaction, we must first identify all its structural features that contribute to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as degrees of unsaturation.\n*   **`cyclohex-3-ene`**: This is a six-membered ring (which counts as 1 IHD) containing one carbon-carbon double bond (1 IHD).\n*   **`carboxylic acid` (-COOH)**: This functional group contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which counts as 1 IHD.\n*   **`formyl` (-CHO)**: This is an aldehyde group, which also contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), counting as 1 IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` (-CH=CH₂)**: This substituent contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), counting as 1 IHD.\n\nSumming these up, the IHD of the starting material is 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = **5**.\n\n**2.

Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD can be calculated in two ways, both of which should yield the same result.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using the Molecular Formula (C₁₀H₂₀)**\n    The formula for IHD is: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n    IHD = 11 - 10\n    IHD = 1\n\n*   **Method 2: Analyzing the Product's Structure**\n    The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n    *   Number of rings in the product = 1 (the cyclohexane ring remains).\n    *   Number of π bonds in the product = 0 (all double bonds were reduced).\n    *   IHD = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.

To understand the reaction, we need to identify all its structural features that contribute to the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD).\n*   **Cyclic Structure:** It has a six-membered ring (`cyclohex-`), which accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n*   **Carbon-Carbon Double Bonds (C=C):**\n    *   One C=C bond is within the ring (`-3-ene`).\n    *   One C=C bond is in the vinyl group (`-CH=CH₂`).\n*   **Carbon-Oxygen Double Bonds (C=O):**\n    *   One C=O bond is in the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`).\n    *   One C=O bond is in the formyl group (`-CHO`).\n\nThe total IHD of the starting material is the sum of these features: 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\nThe reagent used is red phosphorus and an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + excess HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent. Its key functions in this context are:\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It reduces oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to their corresponding alkane groups (in this case, methyl groups, -CH₃).\n*   It does not break the stable ring structure.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product**\nThe reaction will reduce all the double bonds (both C=C and C=O) in the starting material but will leave the carbon skeleton, including the ring, intact.\n*   The C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced, forming a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The C=C bond in the vinyl group is reduced, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   The C=O bond in the formyl group is reduced, converting the group to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group is reduced, converting the group to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a fully saturated, substituted cyclohexane. It contains only single bonds and a single ring.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\nThe IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n*   **Number of rings:** The product still has the one six-membered ring. So, number of rings = 1.\n*   **Number of π bonds:** All double bonds were reduced to single bonds during the reaction. So, number of π bonds = 0.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the final product is 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n**Alternative Method (using molecular formula):**\n1.  The starting material (C₁₀H₁₂O₃) has 10 carbon atoms. The reduction does not change the number of carbons.\n2.  The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane). The general formula for such a compound is CₙH₂ₙ.\n3.  For n=10, the product's molecular formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n4.  Using the IHD formula (IHD = C + 1 - H/2):\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.

Let's break down its structure to identify all sources of unsaturation (rings and pi bonds).\n*   **`cyclohex-3-ene`**: This indicates a six-membered ring (which counts as one degree of unsaturation) containing one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C, a second degree of unsaturation).\n*   **`-carboxylic acid`**: This is a -COOH group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O, a third degree of unsaturation).\n*   **`2-formyl`**: This is an aldehyde group (-CHO), which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O, a fourth degree of unsaturation).\n*   **`5-vinyl`**: This is a -CH=CH₂ group, which contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C, a fifth degree of unsaturation).\n\nSumming these up, the starting material has an Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of 1 (ring) + 4 (pi bonds) = 5.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This combination is known in organic chemistry as one of the most powerful reducing agents. Its function is to completely reduce various functional groups to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It does not break open stable cycloalkane rings.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product's Structure\nThe reaction will cause the following transformations on the starting molecule:\n*   The C=C double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, forming a **cyclohexane** ring.\n*   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group is reduced, converting it to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂-CH₃).\n*   The C=O double bond in the formyl group is reduced, converting the group to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group is reduced, converting the group to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a fully saturated molecule. It consists of a cyclohexane ring with alkyl substituents. All the original pi bonds (both C=C and C=O) have been eliminated.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Number of rings**: The product still contains the six-membered cyclohexane ring. So, the number of rings is **1**.\n*   **Number of pi bonds**: The powerful reduction has eliminated all double bonds. So, the number of pi bonds is **0**.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the final product is:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\nThis result can be confirmed by determining the molecular formula. The starting material has 10 carbon atoms, and this number is conserved. The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane, which has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. For n=10, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀. Using the IHD formula (IHD = C + 1 - H/2), we get IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1, which corresponds to the single ring in the structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully determined the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the product of the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Reactant and Reaction:** The starting material, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has a 10-carbon skeleton. The reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI is a powerful reduction that saturates all double bonds and removes all oxygen atoms, while preserving the carbon ring.\n2.  **Product:** The final product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane) with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for such a compound is CₙH₂ₙ, which in this case is C₁₀H₂₀.\n3.  **IHD Calculation:** The code calculated the IHD for the product C₁₀H₂₀ using the formula `IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The IHD of the final product is 1, which corresponds to the single ring structure remaining after the complete reduction.

Identify the Starting Material and its Unsaturation Points**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. To find the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), we need to identify all rings and pi (π) bonds.\n*   **Ring:** There is one six-membered ring (the `cyclohex-3-ene` structure). This contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Pi Bonds (π bonds):**\n    *   One C=C double bond within the ring (`-3-ene`).

For our product, this means the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD can be calculated in two ways, both of which should yield the same result.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using the Molecular Formula (C₁₀H₂₀)**\n    The formula for IHD is: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n    IHD = 11 - 10\n    IHD = 1\n\n*   **Method 2: Analyzing the Product's Structure**\n    The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n    *   Number of rings in the product = 1 (the cyclohexane ring remains).\n    *   Number of π bonds in the product = 0 (all double bonds were reduced).\n    *   IHD = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.

To understand the reaction, we need to identify all its structural features that contribute to the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD).\n*   **Cyclic Structure:** It has a six-membered ring (`cyclohex-`), which accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n*   **Carbon-Carbon Double Bonds (C=C):**\n    *   One C=C bond is within the ring (`-3-ene`).\n    *   One C=C bond is in the vinyl group (`-CH=CH₂`).\n*   **Carbon-Oxygen Double Bonds (C=O):**\n    *   One C=O bond is in the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`).\n    *   One C=O bond is in the formyl group (`-CHO`).\n\nThe total IHD of the starting material is the sum of these features: 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\nThe reagent used is red phosphorus and an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + excess HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent. Its key functions in this context are:\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It reduces oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to their corresponding alkane groups (in this case, methyl groups, -CH₃).\n*   It does not break the stable ring structure.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product**\nThe reaction will reduce all the double bonds (both C=C and C=O) in the starting material but will leave the carbon skeleton, including the ring, intact.\n*   The C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced, forming a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The C=C bond in the vinyl group is reduced, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   The C=O bond in the formyl group is reduced, converting the group to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group is reduced, converting the group to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a fully saturated, substituted cyclohexane. It contains only single bonds and a single ring.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\nThe IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n*   **Number of rings:** The product still has the one six-membered ring. So, number of rings = 1.\n*   **Number of π bonds:** All double bonds were reduced to single bonds during the reaction. So, number of π bonds = 0.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the final product is 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n**Alternative Method (using molecular formula):**\n1.  The starting material (C₁₀H₁₂O₃) has 10 carbon atoms. The reduction does not change the number of carbons.\n2.  The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane). The general formula for such a compound is CₙH₂ₙ.\n3.  For n=10, the product's molecular formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n4.

Let's break down its structure to identify all sources of unsaturation (rings and pi bonds).\n*   **`cyclohex-3-ene`**: This indicates a six-membered ring (which counts as one degree of unsaturation) containing one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C, a second degree of unsaturation).\n*   **`-carboxylic acid`**: This is a -COOH group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O, a third degree of unsaturation).\n*   **`2-formyl`**: This is an aldehyde group (-CHO), which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O, a fourth degree of unsaturation).\n*   **`5-vinyl`**: This is a -CH=CH₂ group, which contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C, a fifth degree of unsaturation).\n\nSumming these up, the starting material has an Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of 1 (ring) + 4 (pi bonds) = 5.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This combination is known in organic chemistry as one of the most powerful reducing agents. Its function is to completely reduce various functional groups to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It does not break open stable cycloalkane rings.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product's Structure\nThe reaction will cause the following transformations on the starting molecule:\n*   The C=C double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, forming a **cyclohexane** ring.\n*   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group is reduced, converting it to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂-CH₃).\n*   The C=O double bond in the formyl group is reduced, converting the group to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group is reduced, converting the group to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a fully saturated molecule. It consists of a cyclohexane ring with alkyl substituents. All the original pi bonds (both C=C and C=O) have been eliminated.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Number of rings**: The product still contains the six-membered cyclohexane ring. So, the number of rings is **1**.\n*   **Number of pi bonds**: The powerful reduction has eliminated all double bonds. So, the number of pi bonds is **0**.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the final product is:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\nThis result can be confirmed by determining the molecular formula. The starting material has 10 carbon atoms, and this number is conserved. The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane, which has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. For n=10, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀. Using the IHD formula (IHD = C + 1 - H/2), we get IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1, which corresponds to the single ring in the structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully determined the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the product of the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Reactant and Reaction:** The starting material, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has a 10-carbon skeleton. The reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI is a powerful reduction that saturates all double bonds and removes all oxygen atoms, while preserving the carbon ring.\n2.  **Product:** The final product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane) with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for such a compound is CₙH₂ₙ, which in this case is C₁₀H₂₀.\n3.  **IHD Calculation:** The code calculated the IHD for the product C₁₀H₂₀ using the formula `IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The IHD of the final product is 1, which corresponds to the single ring structure remaining after the complete reduction.
