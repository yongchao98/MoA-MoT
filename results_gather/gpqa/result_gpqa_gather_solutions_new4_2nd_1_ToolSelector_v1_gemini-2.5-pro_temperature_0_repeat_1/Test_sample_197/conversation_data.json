This is equivalent to calculating the mole fraction of this species and multiplying by 100.\n\n2.  **Relevant Chemical Principles**: In a solution containing a metal ion (M) and a ligand (L), multiple complex species (ML, ML₂, ML₃, etc.) can form. The distribution of these species depends on the free ligand concentration `[L]` and the overall stability constants (β). The mole fraction (αₙ) of a specific complex `MLₙ` is given by the formula:\n    αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n    where β₀ is defined as 1 (representing the free metal ion M).\n\n3.  **Applying the Formula to the Problem**:\n    *   The metal ion is Co²⁺ and the ligand is SCN⁻.\n    *   We want to find the percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]`, so we need to calculate α₂.\n    *   The formula becomes:\n        α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n4.  **Careful Points and Assumptions**:\n    *   **Ligand Concentration**: The problem gives `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. The total cobalt concentration is `c(Co) = 0.01 M`. Since the ligand is in a 10-fold excess compared to the metal, the amount of ligand consumed to form complexes is small relative to its total concentration. Therefore, it is a valid and standard approximation to assume the free (equilibrium) ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` is equal to the given concentration of 0.1 M.\n    *   **Total Cobalt Concentration**: The value `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not needed to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species, as the free metal ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out during the derivation of the mole fraction formula. This information is extraneous.\n\n5.  **Calculation**:\n    *   **Given values**:\n        *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n        *   β₁ = 9\n        *   β₂ = 40\n        *   β₃ = 63\n        *   β₄ = 16\n    *   **Calculate the numerator**: This is the term for the species of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n        Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n    *   **Calculate the denominator**: This is the sum of the terms for all possible species.\n        *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n        Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n    *   **Calculate the mole fraction (α₂)**:\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n    *   **Convert to percentage**:\n        Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 0.16916 × 100% = **16.916%**\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: The calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%.

The formula is:\n    αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n    The percentage is simply αₙ * 100.\n\n3.  **Identify Variables**:\n    *   The complex of interest is `[Co(SCN)₂]`, so we need to calculate α₂.\n    *   The ligand is thiocyanate, `SCN⁻`, and its concentration is given as `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`.\n    *   The stability constants are: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, and β₄=16.\n\n4.  **Careful Points & Assumptions**:\n    *   **Ligand Concentration**: The problem gives `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` and a total cobalt concentration of `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` (or 0.01 M). Since the ligand concentration is ten times greater than the total metal concentration, the ligand is in large excess. This validates the standard assumption that the free ligand concentration at equilibrium is approximately equal to the total given concentration. Therefore, we can confidently use `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` in our calculation.\n    *   **Total Cobalt Concentration**: The formula for the species fraction (αₙ) does not require the total metal concentration, as the free metal ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out during the formula's derivation. Thus, the `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` value is extraneous information.\n\n5.  **Calculation**:\n    We apply the formula for α₂:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    *   **Numerator**:\n        β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Denominator**:\n        *   Term 0 (for free Co²⁺): 1\n        *   Term 1 (for [Co(SCN)]⁺): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n        *   Term 2 (for [Co(SCN)₂]): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n        *   Term 3 (for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n        *   Term 4 (for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n        *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Fraction (α₂)**:\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    *   **Percentage**:\n        Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ **16.9%**\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: The calculation consistently and correctly yields approximately 16.9%. Comparing this to the given options:\n    *   A) 25.6%\n    *   B) 42.3%\n    *   C) 16.9%\n    *   D) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.

Identify the Correct Formula**\nThe percentage of a specific complex in a mixture of complexes can be found by calculating its mole fraction (`αₙ`) and multiplying by 100.

Others (Answers 4, 10) map it to option B (25.6%). This is a simple but critical error in their final conclusion.\n*   The agents that perform the calculation correctly AND map the result to the correct option (Answers 1, 3, 11, 16, 17) all conclude that the answer is D.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe correct calculation yields a result of 16.9%, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires calculating the percentage of a specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This is a classic speciation problem in coordination chemistry.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex and express it as a percentage. The mole fraction, `α₂`, is defined as:\n    `α₂ = [Concentration of [Co(SCN)₂]] / [Total Concentration of all Co species]`\n\n2.  **Identify the Species and Equilibria:** The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is distributed among the free ion and several complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n3.  **Apply the Stability Constants (β):** The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants `βₙ`:\n    `[Co(SCN)ₙ] = βₙ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]ⁿ`\n\n4.  **Derive the Mole Fraction Formula:** By substituting the expressions from step 3 into the definition from step 1, the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, yielding a general formula for the mole fraction of the n-th complex:\n    `αₙ = (βₙ[SCN⁻]ⁿ) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n    The `1` in the denominator represents the relative contribution of the free `Co²⁺` ion (where `β₀ = 1`).\n\n5.  **Check Assumptions:** The problem gives `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. This is the concentration of the free ligand at equilibrium. The total cobalt concentration (`0.01 M`) is also given, but it is not needed for the calculation of the species distribution as long as the free ligand concentration is known. The fact that the ligand is in 10-fold excess justifies using the given value as the free ligand concentration.\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:** We need to calculate `α₂` for the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex.\n    *   **Given values:**\n        *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n        *   `β₁` = 9\n        *   `β₂` = 40\n        *   `β₃` = 63\n        *   `β₄` = 16\n\n    *   **Calculate the numerator (term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`):**\n        `Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n    *   **Calculate the denominator (sum of all terms):**\n        `Denominator = 1 + (β₁[SCN⁻]¹) + (β₂[SCN⁻]²) + (β₃[SCN⁻]³) + (β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n        `Denominator = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)`\n        `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n        `Denominator = 2.3646`\n\n    *   **Calculate the mole fraction `α₂`:**\n        `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n7.  **Convert to Percentage:**\n    `Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated percentage is 16.9%.

Perform the Calculation**\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the denominator, which represents the sum of the relative concentrations of all cobalt species.\n*   Term for `Co²⁺` (n=0): 1\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (n=1): `β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (n=2): `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (n=3): `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (n=4): `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nSum of denominator terms = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNext, identify the value of the numerator, which is the term for the species of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n*   Numerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4`\n\nNow, calculate the fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a percentage:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\n**5.

However, many of them incorrectly map this result to the lettered options (e.g., selecting C or D). This is likely due to a simple clerical error or a different ordering of options in their original context. The mathematical reasoning across the board is sound and consistent. The consensus on the numerical result is overwhelming.\n\nThe correct final answer is the numerical result matched to the correct option letter from the question prompt.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe question asks for the percentage of a specific chemical species, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Correct Formula\nThe percentage of a specific complex in a series of equilibria is determined by its mole fraction (α). The formula for the mole fraction of the n-th complex, `[MLₙ]`, is:\n\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n\nFor the target species `[Co(SCN)₂]`, n=2, L is the ligand `SCN⁻`, and the formula is:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe final percentage is simply α₂ * 100%.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Careful Points and Assumptions\n1.  **Ligand Concentration**: The problem provides `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. The formula requires the *free* (equilibrium) ligand concentration. However, the total cobalt concentration (`c(Co) = 0.01 M`) is ten times smaller than the thiocyanate concentration. This means the ligand is in large excess, and the amount consumed to form complexes is negligible compared to the total. Therefore, it is a standard and valid approximation to use `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` in the calculation.\n2.  **Total Metal Concentration**: The value `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not needed to calculate the percentage distribution of the species, as the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out during the derivation of the mole fraction formula. It is extraneous information in this context.\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Calculation\nUsing the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator (the sum of all relative species concentrations):\n*   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nSum of denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nNext, identify the numerator, which is the term for the species of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n*   Numerator = **0.4**\n\nFinally, calculate the mole fraction (α₂) and the percentage:\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n*   Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nThe calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%. This matches option D.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while most agents performed the calculation correctly to arrive at ~16.9%, many of them made a final error by selecting the wrong option letter (e.g., choosing C or B instead of D). The correct calculation robustly supports the value of 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the final, correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This percentage is equivalent to the mole fraction of the complex multiplied by 100.\n\n1.  **Identify Species and Define Total Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free `Co²⁺` ion and all the complexes formed with the thiocyanate ligand (`SCN⁻`):\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n2.  **Use the Mole Fraction Formula**: The fraction of any specific complex `[Co(SCN)ₙ]` (denoted as αₙ) can be calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[L]`. The formula is derived by expressing each species' concentration in terms of `[Co²⁺]` and `[L]`, which allows the `[Co²⁺]` term to be canceled out. For the target complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, where n=2, the formula is:\n\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Substitute Given Values**: We are given:\n    *   Ligand concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n4.  **Calculate the Denominator**: The denominator represents the sum of the relative proportions of all cobalt species.\n    *   Term for `Co²⁺` (n=0): 1\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\n    Sum of denominator terms = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerator**: The numerator is the term corresponding to the species of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n    *   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = **0.4**\n\n6.  **Calculate the Fraction and Percentage**:\n    *   Fraction (α₂) = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n    *   Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916%\n\nThe calculated percentage is approximately **16.9%**.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Ligand Concentration**: The problem provides the thiocyanate concentration as `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. Since this is in 10-fold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (`c(Co) = 0.01 M`), it is a valid and standard approximation to use this value as the free equilibrium concentration of the ligand in the calculation.\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not required to calculate the percentage distribution of the species, as the free metal ion concentration cancels out in the mole fraction formula.\n*   **Matching Result to Options**: The calculated value is 16.9%. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 42.3%\n    B) 38.1%\n    C) 16.9%\n    D) 25.6%\n    The result correctly matches option C. Several of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but then selected the wrong letter (e.g., D or B). The correct choice is C.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus from the correct calculations among the candidate answers is that the percentage is 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the problem and a review of the candidate answers is necessary.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Identify the Chemical Species:** The solution contains the free cobalt ion (`Co²⁺`) and a series of complexes formed with the thiocyanate ligand (`SCN⁻`): `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation Strategy:** The percentage of a specific complex is found by calculating its mole fraction (α) and multiplying by 100.

A key consideration is whether this is the total or the free equilibrium concentration. Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total metal concentration (0.01 M), the ligand is in significant excess. Therefore, the amount of ligand consumed to form complexes is small, and it is a valid approximation to use the given concentration as the free ligand concentration at equilibrium.\n    *   **Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species, as the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out in the mole fraction formula.

The answers that correctly perform the calculation *and* select the matching option (1, 2, 3, 11, 16, 17) all arrive at 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nThe correct calculated value is ~16.9%, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Relevant Chemical Principles:** In a solution with a metal ion (Co²⁺) and a ligand (SCN⁻), a series of complexes will form. The distribution of the metal among the free ion and the various complexes depends on the ligand concentration and the stability constants of the complexes. The percentage of a specific complex is its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100.\n\n3.  **Formula Derivation:**\n    *   The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of all species:\n        `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n    *   Using the overall stability constants (β), each complex concentration can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion, `[Co²⁺]`, and the free ligand, `[SCN⁻]`:\n        `[Co(SCN)ₙ] = βₙ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]ⁿ`\n    *   The mole fraction of the target species, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`.\n    *   Substituting the expressions and canceling the `[Co²⁺]` term yields the general formula, which is correctly identified by almost all candidate answers:\n        `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n4.  **Identification of Values and Careful Points:**\n    *   **Stability Constants:** β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16.\n    *   **Ligand Concentration `[SCN⁻]`:** The problem states `[SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M`. A key point, noted by several candidates (e.g., Answer 17), is whether this is the *total* or *free* (equilibrium) concentration. Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in 10-fold excess compared to the total metal concentration (0.01 M), it is a standard and reasonable approximation in this context to assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration. All candidate answers correctly adopt this approximation: `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n    *   **Total Cobalt Concentration `c(Co)`:** The value of 10⁻² M is not directly needed for the calculation of the species fraction, as it cancels out. Its presence primarily serves to justify the approximation regarding the ligand concentration.\n\n5.  **Calculation:** All candidate answers that show their work perform the same calculation:\n    *   **Numerator (Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`):**\n        `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   **Denominator (Sum of all species terms):**\n        *   Term for `Co²⁺`: 1\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * 0.1² = 0.4`\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * 0.1³ = 0.063`\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * 0.1⁴ = 0.0016`\n    *   **Sum of Denominator:**\n        `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n    *   **Mole Fraction (α₂):**\n        `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n    *   **Percentage:**\n        `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\n6.  **Conclusion and Final Answer Selection:**\n    The calculation robustly yields a result of approximately **16.9%**.

The '1' in the denominator represents the free metal ion `M` (where β₀ is defined as 1).\n\nFor our specific problem, we want to find the fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]`, so n=2.

The formula is:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[L]²) / (1 + β₁[L]¹ + β₂[L]² + β₃[L]³ + β₄[L]⁴)`\n    where `[L]` is the ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and `βᵢ` are the overall stability constants.\n\n2.  **Given Values**:\n    *   Ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   Stability constants: `β₁=9`, `β₂=40`, `β₃=63`, `β₄=16`\n\n3.  **Calculation**:\n    *   **Numerator**: `β₂[L]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   **Denominator**: `1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴) = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n    *   **Mole Fraction**: `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n    *   **Percentage**: `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The calculation consistently yields approximately 16.9%. This result was also confirmed by the executed Python code, which outputted `16.9%`.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection**: The calculated value of 16.9% directly corresponds to option B. While many of the candidate answers correctly performed the calculation, they incorrectly selected a different option letter (often C or D). The mathematical result is unambiguous.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the percentage of one specific chemical species, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Identify the Correct Formula:** All candidate answers correctly identify the formula for the mole fraction (αₙ) of a metal-ligand complex. For the target species `[Co(SCN)₂]` (where n=2), the formula is:\n\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    This formula correctly represents the concentration of the target species divided by the sum of the relative concentrations of all species (including the free metal ion, for which the term is 1).\n\n3.  **Verify the Input Values:** The problem provides all necessary values:\n    *   Ligand concentration, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   Overall stability constants: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** The calculation is performed consistently across almost all candidate answers.\n    *   **Numerator Calculation:**\n        The term for the target species `[Co(SCN)₂]` is β₂[SCN⁻]².\n        Numerator = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\n    *   **Denominator Calculation:**\n        The denominator is the sum of the terms for all species.\n        *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n        *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n    *   **Fraction Calculation:**\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    *   **Percentage Conversion:**\n        Percentage = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** A key point, noted by several candidates, is that the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M). This justifies the approximation that the free ligand concentration at equilibrium is equal to the given initial concentration, validating the direct use of [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M in the calculation.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not required to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species, as the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out of the fraction.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The calculated value is approximately 16.9%. Comparing this to the given options:\n    *   A) 38.1%\n    *   B) 16.9%\n    *   C) 42.3%\n    *   D) 25.6%\n\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields 16.9%, which corresponds directly to option B. A significant number of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but then failed to map the numerical result to the correct letter option. Based on the correct chemical principles and arithmetic, the answer is 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers, a step-by-step derivation is performed to ensure accuracy and address any potential pitfalls.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Objective**: The goal is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Governing Principle**: In a solution with a metal ion (M) and a ligand (L) forming a series of complexes (ML, ML₂, ML₃, etc.), the distribution of the metal among the different species depends on the free ligand concentration `[L]` and the overall stability constants (β). The fraction of a specific species `MLₙ`, denoted `αₙ`, can be calculated without knowing the total metal concentration.\n\n3.  **Formula**: The fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex, `α₂`, is given by the formula:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n    The percentage is simply `α₂ * 100`.\n\n4.  **Careful Points & Verification**:\n    *   **Ligand Concentration**: The problem gives `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. A key point is whether this is the *total* or *free* (equilibrium) concentration. Since the total cobalt concentration (`c(Co) = 0.01 M`) is 10 times smaller than the thiocyanate concentration, the ligand is in significant excess. This means the amount of thiocyanate consumed to form complexes is small compared to its total amount. Therefore, it is a valid and standard approximation to use `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M` as the free ligand concentration. Nearly all candidate answers correctly adopt this simplification.\n    *   **Calculation Accuracy**: The final answer depends on correct arithmetic. Let's perform the calculation meticulously.\n        *   **Numerator**: This is the term for the species of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n            Numerator = `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n        *   **Denominator**: This is the sum of the terms for all possible cobalt species (including the free ion, for which the term is 1).\n            *   Term for `Co²⁺`: 1\n            *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n            *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n            *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n            *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n        *   **Sum of Denominator**: `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n    *   **Final Fraction and Percentage**:\n        *   `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n        *   `Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\n5.  **Conclusion and Comparison with Options**:\n    *   The calculated percentage is approximately **16.9%**.\n    *   Comparing this with the given options:\n        A) 25.6%\n        B) 16.9%\n        C) 38.1%\n        D) 42.3%\n    *   The result matches option B.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: The vast majority of the candidate answers correctly perform the calculation and arrive at the numerical result of 16.9%.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the candidate answers and identifying key points for a definitive solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the percentage of a specific chemical species, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Select the Correct Formula:** The percentage of a specific complex is its mole fraction (`αₙ`) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction is calculated using the overall stability constants (`β`) and the free ligand concentration (`[L]`). The correct formula, which was unanimously used by all candidate agents, is:\n    `αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ[L]ⁱ))`\n    For the target species `[Co(SCN)₂]`, where n=2, the formula is:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:** Substitute the given values into the formula:\n    *   Ligand concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   Stability constants: `β₁=9`, `β₂=40`, `β₃=63`, `β₄=16`\n\n    *   **Numerator Calculation** (for the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species):\n        `Numerator = β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n    *   **Denominator Calculation** (sum of terms for all species):\n        *   Term for `Co²⁺` (n=0): 1\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (n=1): `β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (n=2): `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (n=3): `β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (n=4): `β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n        *   **Sum of Denominator Terms** = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    *   **Calculate the Mole Fraction (α₂):**\n        `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n    *   **Convert to Percentage:**\n        `Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916%`\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:** The calculation robustly yields a result of approximately **16.9%**. This numerical result is agreed upon by every single candidate answer that showed its work.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Ligand Concentration Approximation:** The problem provides `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. Since the total cobalt concentration (`c(Co) = 0.01 M`) is ten times smaller than the thiocyanate concentration, the ligand is in large excess. This makes the amount of ligand consumed to form complexes negligible, justifying the standard and valid approximation that the free ligand concentration is equal to the given total concentration (`[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`).\n2.  **Extraneous Information:** The total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not directly required for the percentage calculation. Its primary purpose in the problem statement is to validate the ligand concentration approximation mentioned above.\n3.  **Matching Calculation to Options:** This is the most critical point of analysis. The calculation consistently and correctly yields **16.9%**. The candidate answers show widespread confusion, with different agents matching this same numerical result to options A, B, C, or D.

This is equivalent to calculating the mole fraction of this species and multiplying by 100.\n\n2.  **Relevant Chemical Principles**: In a solution containing a metal ion (M) and a ligand (L), multiple complex species (ML, ML₂, ML₃, etc.) can form. The distribution of these species depends on the free ligand concentration `[L]` and the overall stability constants (β). The mole fraction (αₙ) of a specific complex `MLₙ` is given by the formula:\n    αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n    where β₀ is defined as 1 (representing the free metal ion M).\n\n3.  **Applying the Formula to the Problem**:\n    *   The metal ion is Co²⁺ and the ligand is SCN⁻.\n    *   We want to find the percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]`, so we need to calculate α₂.\n    *   The formula becomes:\n        α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n4.  **Careful Points and Assumptions**:\n    *   **Ligand Concentration**: The problem gives `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. The total cobalt concentration is `c(Co) = 0.01 M`. Since the ligand is in a 10-fold excess compared to the metal, the amount of ligand consumed to form complexes is small relative to its total concentration. Therefore, it is a valid and standard approximation to assume the free (equilibrium) ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` is equal to the given concentration of 0.1 M.\n    *   **Total Cobalt Concentration**: The value `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not needed to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species, as the free metal ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out during the derivation of the mole fraction formula.

This validates the standard assumption that the free ligand concentration at equilibrium is approximately equal to the total given concentration. Therefore, we can confidently use `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` in our calculation.\n    *   **Total Cobalt Concentration**: The formula for the species fraction (αₙ) does not require the total metal concentration, as the free metal ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out during the formula's derivation. Thus, the `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` value is extraneous information.\n\n5.  **Calculation**:\n    We apply the formula for α₂:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    *   **Numerator**:\n        β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Denominator**:\n        *   Term 0 (for free Co²⁺): 1\n        *   Term 1 (for [Co(SCN)]⁺): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n        *   Term 2 (for [Co(SCN)₂]): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n        *   Term 3 (for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n        *   Term 4 (for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n        *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Fraction (α₂)**:\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    *   **Percentage**:\n        Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ **16.9%**\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: The calculation consistently and correctly yields approximately 16.9%.

Identify the Correct Formula**\nThe percentage of a specific complex in a mixture of complexes can be found by calculating its mole fraction (`αₙ`) and multiplying by 100. The mole fraction is the concentration of the species of interest divided by the sum of the concentrations of all related species.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt is:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (`β`), this can be rewritten as:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (`α₂`) is:\n`α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstituting the relevant expressions and canceling the `[Co²⁺]` term gives the final formula, which is correctly identified by almost all the candidate answers:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3.

Let's calculate the numerator and the denominator of the fraction separately.\n\n*   **Numerator**: This is the term for the species of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n    `Numerator = β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n*   **Denominator**: This is the sum of the terms for all possible species (including the free ion, for which the term is 1).\n    *   Term for `Co²⁺`: 1\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n    *   `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n*   **Calculate the Fraction (`α₂`)**:\n    `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n*   **Convert to Percentage**:\n    `Percentage = α₂ * 100 ≈ 16.916%`\n\n**5.

Others (Answers 4, 10) map it to option B (25.6%). This is a simple but critical error in their final conclusion.\n*   The agents that perform the calculation correctly AND map the result to the correct option (Answers 1, 3, 11, 16, 17) all conclude that the answer is D.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe correct calculation yields a result of 16.9%, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires calculating the percentage of a specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This is a classic speciation problem in coordination chemistry.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex and express it as a percentage. The mole fraction, `α₂`, is defined as:\n    `α₂ = [Concentration of [Co(SCN)₂]] / [Total Concentration of all Co species]`\n\n2.  **Identify the Species and Equilibria:** The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is distributed among the free ion and several complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n3.  **Apply the Stability Constants (β):** The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants `βₙ`:\n    `[Co(SCN)ₙ] = βₙ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]ⁿ`\n\n4.  **Derive the Mole Fraction Formula:** By substituting the expressions from step 3 into the definition from step 1, the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, yielding a general formula for the mole fraction of the n-th complex:\n    `αₙ = (βₙ[SCN⁻]ⁿ) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n    The `1` in the denominator represents the relative contribution of the free `Co²⁺` ion (where `β₀ = 1`).\n\n5.  **Check Assumptions:** The problem gives `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. This is the concentration of the free ligand at equilibrium. The total cobalt concentration (`0.01 M`) is also given, but it is not needed for the calculation of the species distribution as long as the free ligand concentration is known. The fact that the ligand is in 10-fold excess justifies using the given value as the free ligand concentration.\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:** We need to calculate `α₂` for the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex.\n    *   **Given values:**\n        *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n        *   `β₁` = 9\n        *   `β₂` = 40\n        *   `β₃` = 63\n        *   `β₄` = 16\n\n    *   **Calculate the numerator (term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`):**\n        `Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n    *   **Calculate the denominator (sum of all terms):**\n        `Denominator = 1 + (β₁[SCN⁻]¹) + (β₂[SCN⁻]²) + (β₃[SCN⁻]³) + (β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n        `Denominator = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)`\n        `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n        `Denominator = 2.3646`\n\n    *   **Calculate the mole fraction `α₂`:**\n        `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n7.  **Convert to Percentage:**\n    `Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated percentage is 16.9%. This matches option C. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most performed the calculation correctly, several made a clerical error in selecting the final option letter.

The formula for the mole fraction of the n-th complex, `[MLₙ]`, is:\n\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n\nFor the target species `[Co(SCN)₂]`, n=2, L is the ligand `SCN⁻`, and the formula is:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe final percentage is simply α₂ * 100%.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Careful Points and Assumptions\n1.  **Ligand Concentration**: The problem provides `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. The formula requires the *free* (equilibrium) ligand concentration. However, the total cobalt concentration (`c(Co) = 0.01 M`) is ten times smaller than the thiocyanate concentration. This means the ligand is in large excess, and the amount consumed to form complexes is negligible compared to the total. Therefore, it is a standard and valid approximation to use `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` in the calculation.\n2.  **Total Metal Concentration**: The value `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not needed to calculate the percentage distribution of the species, as the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out during the derivation of the mole fraction formula. It is extraneous information in this context.\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Calculation\nUsing the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator (the sum of all relative species concentrations):\n*   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nSum of denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nNext, identify the numerator, which is the term for the species of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n*   Numerator = **0.4**\n\nFinally, calculate the mole fraction (α₂) and the percentage:\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n*   Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nThe calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%.

This percentage is equivalent to the mole fraction of the complex multiplied by 100.\n\n1.  **Identify Species and Define Total Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free `Co²⁺` ion and all the complexes formed with the thiocyanate ligand (`SCN⁻`):\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n2.  **Use the Mole Fraction Formula**: The fraction of any specific complex `[Co(SCN)ₙ]` (denoted as αₙ) can be calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[L]`. The formula is derived by expressing each species' concentration in terms of `[Co²⁺]` and `[L]`, which allows the `[Co²⁺]` term to be canceled out. For the target complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, where n=2, the formula is:\n\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Substitute Given Values**: We are given:\n    *   Ligand concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n4.  **Calculate the Denominator**: The denominator represents the sum of the relative proportions of all cobalt species.\n    *   Term for `Co²⁺` (n=0): 1\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\n    Sum of denominator terms = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerator**: The numerator is the term corresponding to the species of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n    *   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = **0.4**\n\n6.  **Calculate the Fraction and Percentage**:\n    *   Fraction (α₂) = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n    *   Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916%\n\nThe calculated percentage is approximately **16.9%**.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Ligand Concentration**: The problem provides the thiocyanate concentration as `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. Since this is in 10-fold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (`c(Co) = 0.01 M`), it is a valid and standard approximation to use this value as the free equilibrium concentration of the ligand in the calculation.\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not required to calculate the percentage distribution of the species, as the free metal ion concentration cancels out in the mole fraction formula.\n*   **Matching Result to Options**: The calculated value is 16.9%. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 42.3%\n    B) 38.1%\n    C) 16.9%\n    D) 25.6%\n    The result correctly matches option C. Several of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but then selected the wrong letter (e.g., D or B). The correct choice is C.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus from the correct calculations among the candidate answers is that the percentage is 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the problem and a review of the candidate answers is necessary.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Identify the Chemical Species:** The solution contains the free cobalt ion (`Co²⁺`) and a series of complexes formed with the thiocyanate ligand (`SCN⁻`): `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation Strategy:** The percentage of a specific complex is found by calculating its mole fraction (α) and multiplying by 100. The mole fraction of the n-th complex (`αₙ`) is given by the formula:\n    αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n    For the target species `[Co(SCN)₂]`, n=2. The formula becomes:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Data:**\n    *   Stability constants: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16.\n    *   Ligand concentration: [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.\n    *   Total metal concentration: c(Co) = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M.\n\n5.  **Address Careful Points:**\n    *   **Ligand Concentration:** The problem provides `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. A key consideration is whether this is the total or the free equilibrium concentration. Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total metal concentration (0.01 M), the ligand is in significant excess. Therefore, the amount of ligand consumed to form complexes is small, and it is a valid approximation to use the given concentration as the free ligand concentration at equilibrium.\n    *   **Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species, as the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out in the mole fraction formula. Its inclusion in the problem statement primarily serves to justify the approximation of the free ligand concentration.\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Numerator (Term for [Co(SCN)₂]):**\n        β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   **Denominator (Sum of all species terms):**\n        *   Term for Co²⁺ (β₀=1): 1\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × 0.1² = 0.4\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × 0.1³ = 0.063\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × 0.1⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   **Sum of Denominator:**\n        1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n    *   **Calculate the Mole Fraction (α₂):**\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n    *   **Convert to Percentage:**\n        Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916%\n\n### Conclusion from Candidate Answers\n\nA review of the provided answers shows that the vast majority correctly identify the formula and perform the calculation, arriving at a result of approximately 16.9%. Several answers (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15) incorrectly select option B or C despite their own correct calculations. This appears to be a transcription error when matching the calculated value to the multiple-choice options. The answers that correctly perform the calculation *and* select the matching option (1, 2, 3, 11, 16, 17) all arrive at 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nThe correct calculated value is ~16.9%, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Relevant Chemical Principles:** In a solution with a metal ion (Co²⁺) and a ligand (SCN⁻), a series of complexes will form. The distribution of the metal among the free ion and the various complexes depends on the ligand concentration and the stability constants of the complexes. The percentage of a specific complex is its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100.\n\n3.  **Formula Derivation:**\n    *   The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of all species:\n        `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n    *   Using the overall stability constants (β), each complex concentration can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion, `[Co²⁺]`, and the free ligand, `[SCN⁻]`:\n        `[Co(SCN)ₙ] = βₙ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]ⁿ`\n    *   The mole fraction of the target species, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`.\n    *   Substituting the expressions and canceling the `[Co²⁺]` term yields the general formula, which is correctly identified by almost all candidate answers:\n        `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n4.  **Identification of Values and Careful Points:**\n    *   **Stability Constants:** β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16.\n    *   **Ligand Concentration `[SCN⁻]`:** The problem states `[SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M`. A key point, noted by several candidates (e.g., Answer 17), is whether this is the *total* or *free* (equilibrium) concentration. Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in 10-fold excess compared to the total metal concentration (0.01 M), it is a standard and reasonable approximation in this context to assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration. All candidate answers correctly adopt this approximation: `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n    *   **Total Cobalt Concentration `c(Co)`:** The value of 10⁻² M is not directly needed for the calculation of the species fraction, as it cancels out. Its presence primarily serves to justify the approximation regarding the ligand concentration.\n\n5.  **Calculation:** All candidate answers that show their work perform the same calculation:\n    *   **Numerator (Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`):**\n        `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   **Denominator (Sum of all species terms):**\n        *   Term for `Co²⁺`: 1\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * 0.1² = 0.4`\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * 0.1³ = 0.063`\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * 0.1⁴ = 0.0016`\n    *   **Sum of Denominator:**\n        `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n    *   **Mole Fraction (α₂):**\n        `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n    *   **Percentage:**\n        `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\n6.  **Conclusion and Final Answer Selection:**\n    The calculation robustly yields a result of approximately **16.9%**. The candidate answers unanimously agree on this numerical value. The confusion in the letters chosen by the candidates (B, C, D) is irrelevant, as it stems from different initial orderings of the options. Based on the options provided in the question prompt:\n    A) 42.3%\n    B) 16.9%\n    C) 38.1%\n    D) 25.6%\n\n    The correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of a specific chemical species, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This is equivalent to finding the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]` and expressing it as a percentage.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Formula**\nThe mole fraction (αₙ) of a metal-ligand complex `[MLₙ]` in a solution containing a series of such complexes is given by the formula:\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\nwhere:\n*   `L` is the ligand, in this case, `SCN⁻`.\n*   `βₙ` is the overall stability constant for the complex `[MLₙ]`.\n*   The summation in the denominator is over all possible complexes (i=1 to the maximum coordination number). The '1' in the denominator represents the free metal ion `M` (where β₀ is defined as 1).\n\nFor our specific problem, we want to find the fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]`, so n=2. The formula becomes:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. List the Given Values**\n*   Ligand concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   Overall stability constants:\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n**4. Careful Points to Consider**\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The problem gives `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. Since this concentration is 10 times greater than the total cobalt concentration (`c(Co) = 0.01 M`), the ligand is in significant excess. This justifies the standard assumption that the free ligand concentration at equilibrium is approximately equal to the given total concentration, i.e., `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n*   **Total Metal Concentration:** The value `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not needed to calculate the *percentage* distribution of the species, as the free metal ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out during the derivation of the mole fraction formula. It is extraneous information in this context.\n*   **Calculation Accuracy:** The calculation involves powers of 0.1. It is crucial to perform the arithmetic correctly.\n\n**5. Step-by-Step Calculation**\nFirst, calculate the value of the numerator, which corresponds to the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate the value of the denominator by summing the terms for all species:\n*   Term for `Co²⁺` (n=0): 1\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nNow, calculate the mole fraction (α₂):\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a percentage:\n*   Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 0.16916 × 100% = **16.916%**\n\n**6.

For the target species `[Co(SCN)₂]` (where n=2), the formula is:\n\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    This formula correctly represents the concentration of the target species divided by the sum of the relative concentrations of all species (including the free metal ion, for which the term is 1).\n\n3.  **Verify the Input Values:** The problem provides all necessary values:\n    *   Ligand concentration, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   Overall stability constants: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** The calculation is performed consistently across almost all candidate answers.\n    *   **Numerator Calculation:**\n        The term for the target species `[Co(SCN)₂]` is β₂[SCN⁻]².\n        Numerator = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\n    *   **Denominator Calculation:**\n        The denominator is the sum of the terms for all species.\n        *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n        *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n    *   **Fraction Calculation:**\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    *   **Percentage Conversion:**\n        Percentage = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** A key point, noted by several candidates, is that the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M). This justifies the approximation that the free ligand concentration at equilibrium is equal to the given initial concentration, validating the direct use of [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M in the calculation.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not required to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species, as the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out of the fraction.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The calculated value is approximately 16.9%. Comparing this to the given options:\n    *   A) 38.1%\n    *   B) 16.9%\n    *   C) 42.3%\n    *   D) 25.6%\n\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields 16.9%, which corresponds directly to option B. A significant number of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but then failed to map the numerical result to the correct letter option. Based on the correct chemical principles and arithmetic, the answer is 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers, a step-by-step derivation is performed to ensure accuracy and address any potential pitfalls.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Objective**: The goal is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Governing Principle**: In a solution with a metal ion (M) and a ligand (L) forming a series of complexes (ML, ML₂, ML₃, etc.), the distribution of the metal among the different species depends on the free ligand concentration `[L]` and the overall stability constants (β). The fraction of a specific species `MLₙ`, denoted `αₙ`, can be calculated without knowing the total metal concentration.\n\n3.  **Formula**: The fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex, `α₂`, is given by the formula:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n    The percentage is simply `α₂ * 100`.\n\n4.  **Careful Points & Verification**:\n    *   **Ligand Concentration**: The problem gives `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. A key point is whether this is the *total* or *free* (equilibrium) concentration. Since the total cobalt concentration (`c(Co) = 0.01 M`) is 10 times smaller than the thiocyanate concentration, the ligand is in significant excess. This means the amount of thiocyanate consumed to form complexes is small compared to its total amount. Therefore, it is a valid and standard approximation to use `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M` as the free ligand concentration. Nearly all candidate answers correctly adopt this simplification.\n    *   **Calculation Accuracy**: The final answer depends on correct arithmetic. Let's perform the calculation meticulously.\n        *   **Numerator**: This is the term for the species of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n            Numerator = `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n        *   **Denominator**: This is the sum of the terms for all possible cobalt species (including the free ion, for which the term is 1).\n            *   Term for `Co²⁺`: 1\n            *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n            *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n            *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n            *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n        *   **Sum of Denominator**: `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n    *   **Final Fraction and Percentage**:\n        *   `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n        *   `Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\n5.  **Conclusion and Comparison with Options**:\n    *   The calculated percentage is approximately **16.9%**.\n    *   Comparing this with the given options:\n        A) 25.6%\n        B) 16.9%\n        C) 38.1%\n        D) 42.3%\n    *   The result matches option B.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: The vast majority of the candidate answers correctly perform the calculation and arrive at the numerical result of 16.9%. However, many of them incorrectly associate this result with options C or D, indicating a confusion with the option lettering. The calculation itself is consistently correct across the board.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",
