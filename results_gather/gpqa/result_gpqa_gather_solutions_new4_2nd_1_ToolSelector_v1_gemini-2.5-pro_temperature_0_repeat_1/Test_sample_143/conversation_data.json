Identify the Goal and Given Information\nThe objective is to calculate the mean decay distance ($L$) of the particle X in the laboratory frame.\n\n**Given:**\n*   Total energy: $E_{X} = 8 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n*   Rest mass energy: $m_{X}c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n*   Decay width: $\\Gamma_{X} = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n### 2. Select the Correct Physical Formula\nThe mean decay distance ($L$) of a relativistic particle is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lifetime as measured in the laboratory frame ($t_{lab}$).\n\n*   The lab-frame lifetime is dilated from the particle's proper lifetime ($\\tau$) by the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$: $t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$.\n*   The proper lifetime is inversely related to the decay width by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\\tau = \\hbar / \\Gamma_X$.\n*   The velocity is $v = \\beta c$.\n\nCombining these gives the formula for the mean decay distance:\n$L = v \\cdot t_{lab} = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau) = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} = (\\gamma \\beta) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nTo make the calculation most direct, we can express the term $\\gamma \\beta$ using the given energy and mass. From the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, we find the momentum $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$.

However, the underlying physics and calculation are consistent and point to a single numerical result. Based on the options provided in the problem description, this numerical result corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physical Concepts\nThe question asks for the **mean decay distance** of a relativistic particle (a meson resonance X) in the laboratory frame. This distance, denoted as `L`, is the product of the particle's velocity (`v`) and its mean lifetime as measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`).\n\n1.  **Proper Lifetime (τ):** The lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame is called the proper lifetime. It is related to the particle's decay width (Γ) through the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    `τ = ħ / Γ`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** Because the particle is moving at a relativistic speed, its lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab. This lab-frame lifetime (`t_lab`) is related to the proper lifetime (`τ`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n    `t_lab = γ * τ`\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Distance (L):** The distance is the velocity (`v = βc`) multiplied by the lab-frame lifetime:\n    `L = v * t_lab = (βc) * (γτ) = γβcτ`\n\n### Step 2: Formulate a Calculation Strategy\nCombining the formulas from Step 1 gives the most direct equation for the mean decay distance:\n`L = γβ * c * (ħ / Γ) = γβ * (ħc / Γ)`\n\nTo solve this, we need to calculate two terms: `γβ` and `ħc / Γ`.\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Calculations\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   Total energy, `E_X = 8 GeV`\n*   Rest mass energy, `m_X c² = 1.2 GeV`\n*   Decay width, `Γ_X = 320 MeV`\n\n**Constants:**\n*   A convenient value for the physical constant `ħc` is `197.3 MeV·fm`, where `1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m`.\n\n**Sub-step 3a: Calculate the relativistic factor `γβ`**\nThe term `γβ` can be calculated from the particle's energy and mass.\nFrom the relativistic energy-momentum relation `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, we can find the momentum `pc`:\n`(pc)² = E_X² - (m_X c²)² = (8 GeV)² - (1.2 GeV)² = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 GeV²`\n`pc = √62.56 GeV ≈ 7.9095 GeV`\n\nThe momentum is also defined as `p = γmv = γm(βc)`, which means `pc = γβ(mc²)`. We can rearrange this to solve for `γβ`:\n`γβ = pc / (m_X c²) = (√62.56 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ≈ 6.5912`\n\n**Sub-step 3b: Calculate `ħc / Γ`**\nFirst, ensure the units are consistent. We will use MeV.\n`Γ_X = 320 MeV`\n`ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm`\n\n`ħc / Γ_X = (197.3 MeV·fm) / (320 MeV) ≈ 0.61656 fm`\n\n**Sub-step 3c: Calculate the Mean Decay Distance `L`**\nNow, multiply the two terms:\n`L = γβ * (ħc / Γ_X)`\n`L ≈ 6.5912 * 0.61656 fm ≈ 4.0655 fm`\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer and Unit Conversion\nThe result of the calculation is `L ≈ 4.0655 fm`.\nSince 1 femtometer (fm) is equal to `10⁻¹⁵` meters, the mean decay distance is:\n`L ≈ 4.0655 × 10⁻¹⁵ m`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options\nLet's compare our calculated result with the provided options:\nA) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\nB) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nC) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nD) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nOur calculated value, `4.0655 × 10⁻¹⁵ m`, matches option A exactly.\n\n### Careful Points Summary:\n*   **Distinguish Frames of Reference:** The decay width `Γ` and proper lifetime `τ` are defined in the particle's rest frame, while the decay distance is measured in the lab frame. Time dilation (`γ`) must be accounted for.\n*   **Use Relativistic Formulas:** The particle's energy is significantly greater than its mass, so relativistic kinematics are required.\n*   **Unit Consistency:** Ensure all energy units (GeV, MeV) are consistent before performing calculations. Converting `Γ_X` from MeV to GeV or using `ħc` in MeV·fm and `Γ_X` in MeV is crucial.\n*   **Efficient Calculation:** Using the combined constant `ħc` and the formula `L = (pc / mc²) * (ħc / Γ)` is the most direct and least error-prone method.\n\nThe analysis confirms that the calculation is correct and robust, as demonstrated by the consensus among the provided answers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1.

Let's break down the calculation into clear steps and identify potential pitfalls.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts and Formula\n\nThe mean decay distance ($L$) of a particle in the laboratory frame is the product of its velocity ($v$) and its mean lifetime as measured in the lab frame ($t_{lab}$).\n\n1.  **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau$):** The lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame is called the proper lifetime. It is related to the particle's decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    $L = v \\cdot t_{lab}$\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** Because the particle is moving at a relativistic speed, its lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab. This is known as time dilation. The lab-frame lifetime is related to the proper lifetime by the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):\n    $t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Distance ($L$):** The velocity is often expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, $v = \\beta c$. Combining these concepts, the formula for the mean decay distance becomes:\n    $L = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau) = \\beta\\gamma c \\tau$\n\n4.  **Using Decay Width:** We can substitute the expression for the proper lifetime ($\\tau = \\hbar/\\Gamma$) into the equation:\n    $L = \\beta\\gamma \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n    This is the most convenient formula for this problem.

Understand the Goal and Physical Principles\n\nThe objective is to calculate the **mean decay distance (L)** of a relativistic particle (meson X) in the laboratory frame. This requires combining principles from special relativity and quantum mechanics.\n\n*   **Proper Lifetime and Decay Width:** The particle's lifetime in its own rest frame (proper lifetime, τ) is inversely proportional to its decay width (Γ), a relationship derived from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    `τ = ħ / Γ`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n*   **Time Dilation and Decay Distance:** Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is longer (`γτ`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor). The distance it travels is its velocity (`v`) multiplied by this lab-frame lifetime.\n    `L = v * (γτ)`\n\n*   **Combined Formula:** Using `v = βc` (where `β` is the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light `c`), the formula becomes:\n    `L = γβcτ = γβ * (ħc / Γ)`\n\nThis final form is the most direct way to solve the problem.\n\n### 2.

Find the momentum using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n    `(pc)² = E_X² - (m_X c²)²`\n    `(pc)² = (8 GeV)² - (1.2 GeV)² = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 GeV²`\n    `pc = √62.56 GeV ≈ 7.9095 GeV`\n\n2.  Use the relation `pc = γβ(mc²)`, which gives:\n    `γβ = pc / (m_X c²) = (√62.56 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ≈ 6.5912`\n\n**Step C: Calculate the Mean Decay Distance (L)**\nNow, substitute the values into the combined formula:\n`L = γβ * (ħc / Γ_X)`\n`L ≈ 6.5912 * (0.1973 GeV·fm / 0.320 GeV)`\nThe GeV units cancel out, leaving the result in femtometers (fm).\n`L ≈ 6.5912 * (0.61656 fm)`\n`L ≈ 4.0655 fm`\n\n**Step D: Convert to Meters**\nSince 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m, the mean decay distance is:\n`L ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m`\n\n### 3.

However, the physics and the resulting numerical value are consistent across the majority of correct derivations.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Unit Consistency:** Converting the decay width from MeV to GeV is essential.\n*   **Relativistic Formulas:** Using the full relativistic expressions for momentum and the decay distance is required.\n*   **Exponent Check:** The final answer must be carefully checked against the options, paying close attention to the exponent (10⁻¹⁵ vs. 10⁻¹⁶).\n\nThe calculation is robust and the result clearly corresponds to one of the options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Concepts\n\nThe problem asks for the **mean decay distance** ($L$) of a relativistic particle. This is the average distance the particle travels in the laboratory's frame of reference before it decays. The key concepts are:\n\n*   **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau$):** The lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame. It is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: $\\tau = \\hbar / \\Gamma$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **Time Dilation:** To an observer in the lab, the particle's lifetime appears longer due to its high speed. This lab-frame lifetime ($t_{lab}$) is given by $t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Mean Decay Distance ($L$):** This is the particle's velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime. It is most conveniently expressed using the formula:\n    $L = \\gamma \\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\beta = v/c$ is the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light, and $\\hbar c$ is a useful physical constant.\n\n### 2. Deriving the Calculation Formula\n\nTo use the formula above, we need to find the term $\\gamma\\beta$. This can be calculated directly from the particle's total energy ($E_X$) and its rest mass energy ($m_X c^2$) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E_X^2 = (p_X c)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$.\n\n1.  The momentum is given by $p_X = \\gamma m_X v = \\gamma m_X (\\beta c)$.\n2.  Therefore, $p_X c = \\gamma\\beta (m_X c^2)$.\n3.  From the energy-momentum relation, we can find $p_X c = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$.\n4.  Combining these, we get $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2}$.\n5.  Substituting this back into the formula for $L$ gives the most direct calculation path:\n    $L = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\right) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n### 3.

This distance is the particle's velocity in the lab frame ($v$) multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame ($t_{lab}$).\n\n1.  **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau$):** The particle's lifetime in its own rest frame is determined by its decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) via the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Lab Frame Lifetime ($t_{lab}$):** Due to relativistic time dilation, the lifetime observed in the lab is longer by a factor of $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor):\n    $t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Distance ($L$):** The distance is velocity times time.

The other options are incorrect by orders of magnitude or have a significantly different value. Therefore, the calculation confirms that C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Goal and Necessary Formulas\nThe objective is to calculate the **mean decay distance (L)** of the meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\nThe key formulas required are:\n1.  The relationship between the mean decay distance (L), the particle's velocity (v), and its lifetime in the lab frame (t_lab):\n    $L = v \\cdot t_{lab}$\n2.  The relationship between the lab-frame lifetime (t_lab) and the proper lifetime (τ, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) due to time dilation:\n    $t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$, where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n3.  The relationship between the proper lifetime (τ) and the decay width (Γ) from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nCombining these formulas gives the most direct equation for the mean decay distance:\n$L = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau) = \\beta\\gamma \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\nwhere $\\beta = v/c$ and c is the speed of light.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Relativistic Term (βγ)\nThe term βγ can be calculated directly from the particle's total energy (E) and rest mass energy (mc²).\nFrom the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, we can find the momentum term, $pc$.\n$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$\n\nThe momentum is also defined as $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m (\\beta c)$, which gives $pc = \\beta\\gamma (mc^2)$.\nTherefore, we can calculate βγ as:\n$\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n$\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{\\sqrt{(8 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (1.2 \\text{ GeV})^2}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{64 - 1.44}}{1.2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62.56}}{1.2} \\approx \\frac{7.9095}{1.2} \\approx 6.5912$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Decay Length Term (ħc / Γ)\nThis term requires consistent units. We will use the decay width in MeV and the physical constant ħc in units of MeV·fm.\n*   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (where 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m)\n\n$\\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X} = \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 0.61665 \\text{ fm}$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Mean Decay Distance (L)\nNow, we multiply the results from Step 2 and Step 3:\n$L = (\\beta\\gamma) \\cdot (\\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X})$\n$L \\approx (6.5912) \\cdot (0.61665 \\text{ fm})$\n$L \\approx 4.0655 \\text{ fm}$\n\n### Step 5: Convert to Meters and Select the Correct Option\nSince 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m, the mean decay distance is:\n$L \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nB) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nC) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\nD) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nThe calculated value matches option C exactly.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Unit Consistency:** The decay width is given in MeV, while the energy and mass are in GeV. It is crucial to convert them to a consistent unit before performing calculations.\n*   **Time Dilation:** The decay distance must be calculated using the particle's lifetime in the lab frame ($t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$), not its proper lifetime (τ).\n*   **Use of ħc:** Using the combined constant ħc (in units like MeV·fm) simplifies the calculation and helps avoid rounding errors that can occur when using separate values for ħ and c.\n*   **Order of Magnitude:** The options differ by an order of magnitude (10⁻¹⁵ vs. 10⁻¹⁶). Using ħc in MeV·fm naturally yields a result in femtometers (10⁻¹⁵ m), which helps confirm the correct order of magnitude.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the candidate answers, despite confusion in labeling the final option, correctly calculate the numerical value to be approximately 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the methods and careful points from the provided answers.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Concepts\n\nThe goal is to find the **mean decay distance (L)** of a particle in the laboratory frame. This is the average distance the particle travels before it decays. The calculation involves several key principles of relativistic physics:\n\n*   **Proper Lifetime (τ):** This is the average lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. It is inversely related to the particle's **decay width (Γ)** through the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The formula is `τ = ħ / Γ`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **Time Dilation:** From the perspective of the laboratory, the moving particle's lifetime appears longer than its proper lifetime. This lab-frame lifetime (`t_lab`) is given by `t_lab = γ * τ`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Mean Decay Distance (L):** The distance is simply the particle's velocity (`v`) multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame. The velocity is often written as `v = βc`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    `L = v * t_lab = (βc) * (γτ) = γβcτ`\n\n### 2. Deriving the Calculation Formula\n\nCombining the concepts above gives the primary formula for the mean decay distance:\n`L = γβ * c * (ħ / Γ)`\n\nThis can be rearranged into a more convenient form for calculation using the combined physical constant `ħc`:\n`L = γβ * (ħc / Γ)`\n\nThe term `γβ` can be calculated directly from the particle's total energy (E) and rest mass energy (mc²) without needing to find `γ` and `β` individually.\n\n*   From the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n*   The momentum `p` is also given by `p = γmv = γm(βc)`, which means `pc = γβ(mc²)`.\n*   Solving for `γβ`, we get: `γβ = pc / mc² = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²) / mc²`\n\nSubstituting this back into the formula for L gives the most direct calculation path:\n`L = (sqrt(E² - (mc²)²) / mc²) * (ħc / Γ)`\n\n### 3.

To compare with the options, we convert it to meters.\n*   Since 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m:\n    `L ≈ 4.0645 x 10⁻¹⁵ m`\n\n### 4.

The core task is to calculate the mean decay distance ($L$) of a relativistic particle.\n\n**1. The Governing Formula**\nThe mean decay distance in the laboratory frame is given by the particle's velocity ($v = \\beta c$) multiplied by its lifetime as measured in the lab ($t_{lab}$). The lab lifetime is subject to time dilation ($t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$), and the particle's proper lifetime ($\\tau$) is determined by its decay width ($\\Gamma$) via the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle ($\\tau = \\hbar/\\Gamma$).

Conversion to Meters and Comparison with Options**\nThe result must be converted to meters to match the options.\n*   Since $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$, we have $L \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$.\n\nNow, we compare this result to the options provided in the question:\nA) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\nB) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\nC) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nD) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n\nOur calculated value matches option B exactly.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Unit Consistency**: It is crucial to use consistent units for energy. The calculation above uses GeV for the relativistic factor and MeV for the decay length, which is valid as the units cancel within each term. Converting $\\Gamma_X$ to GeV (0.320 GeV) and using $\\hbar c$ in GeV·fm would yield the same result.\n*   **Relativistic Effects**: The particle is highly relativistic ($E_X \\gg m_X c^2$), so time dilation is a major effect. The factor $\\gamma\\beta \\approx 6.6$ shows that the decay distance is significantly longer than the proper decay length ($c\\tau$).\n*   **Order of Magnitude**: The options include answers with exponents of $10^{-15}$ and $10^{-16}$. The calculation naturally results in femtometers ($10^{-15}$ m), which helps eliminate options A and D.\n*   **Option Shuffling**: The analysis of the candidate answers reveals that different agents were presented with the same numerical options but associated with different letters (A, B, C, D). The crucial step is to match the correctly calculated numerical value to the specific list of options provided in the problem description.\n\nThe consensus of the calculations is clear and robust, pointing to a single numerical answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",

Based on the options provided in the problem description, this numerical result corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physical Concepts\nThe question asks for the **mean decay distance** of a relativistic particle (a meson resonance X) in the laboratory frame. This distance, denoted as `L`, is the product of the particle's velocity (`v`) and its mean lifetime as measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`).\n\n1.  **Proper Lifetime (τ):** The lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame is called the proper lifetime. It is related to the particle's decay width (Γ) through the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    `τ = ħ / Γ`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** Because the particle is moving at a relativistic speed, its lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab. This lab-frame lifetime (`t_lab`) is related to the proper lifetime (`τ`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n    `t_lab = γ * τ`\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Distance (L):** The distance is the velocity (`v = βc`) multiplied by the lab-frame lifetime:\n    `L = v * t_lab = (βc) * (γτ) = γβcτ`\n\n### Step 2: Formulate a Calculation Strategy\nCombining the formulas from Step 1 gives the most direct equation for the mean decay distance:\n`L = γβ * c * (ħ / Γ) = γβ * (ħc / Γ)`\n\nTo solve this, we need to calculate two terms: `γβ` and `ħc / Γ`.\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Calculations\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   Total energy, `E_X = 8 GeV`\n*   Rest mass energy, `m_X c² = 1.2 GeV`\n*   Decay width, `Γ_X = 320 MeV`\n\n**Constants:**\n*   A convenient value for the physical constant `ħc` is `197.3 MeV·fm`, where `1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m`.\n\n**Sub-step 3a: Calculate the relativistic factor `γβ`**\nThe term `γβ` can be calculated from the particle's energy and mass.\nFrom the relativistic energy-momentum relation `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, we can find the momentum `pc`:\n`(pc)² = E_X² - (m_X c²)² = (8 GeV)² - (1.2 GeV)² = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 GeV²`\n`pc = √62.56 GeV ≈ 7.9095 GeV`\n\nThe momentum is also defined as `p = γmv = γm(βc)`, which means `pc = γβ(mc²)`. We can rearrange this to solve for `γβ`:\n`γβ = pc / (m_X c²) = (√62.56 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ≈ 6.5912`\n\n**Sub-step 3b: Calculate `ħc / Γ`**\nFirst, ensure the units are consistent. We will use MeV.\n`Γ_X = 320 MeV`\n`ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm`\n\n`ħc / Γ_X = (197.3 MeV·fm) / (320 MeV) ≈ 0.61656 fm`\n\n**Sub-step 3c: Calculate the Mean Decay Distance `L`**\nNow, multiply the two terms:\n`L = γβ * (ħc / Γ_X)`\n`L ≈ 6.5912 * 0.61656 fm ≈ 4.0655 fm`\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer and Unit Conversion\nThe result of the calculation is `L ≈ 4.0655 fm`.\nSince 1 femtometer (fm) is equal to `10⁻¹⁵` meters, the mean decay distance is:\n`L ≈ 4.0655 × 10⁻¹⁵ m`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options\nLet's compare our calculated result with the provided options:\nA) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\nB) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nC) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nD) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nOur calculated value, `4.0655 × 10⁻¹⁵ m`, matches option A exactly.\n\n### Careful Points Summary:\n*   **Distinguish Frames of Reference:** The decay width `Γ` and proper lifetime `τ` are defined in the particle's rest frame, while the decay distance is measured in the lab frame. Time dilation (`γ`) must be accounted for.\n*   **Use Relativistic Formulas:** The particle's energy is significantly greater than its mass, so relativistic kinematics are required.\n*   **Unit Consistency:** Ensure all energy units (GeV, MeV) are consistent before performing calculations. Converting `Γ_X` from MeV to GeV or using `ħc` in MeV·fm and `Γ_X` in MeV is crucial.\n*   **Efficient Calculation:** Using the combined constant `ħc` and the formula `L = (pc / mc²) * (ħc / Γ)` is the most direct and least error-prone method.\n\nThe analysis confirms that the calculation is correct and robust, as demonstrated by the consensus among the provided answers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1.

Let's break down the calculation into clear steps and identify potential pitfalls.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts and Formula\n\nThe mean decay distance ($L$) of a particle in the laboratory frame is the product of its velocity ($v$) and its mean lifetime as measured in the lab frame ($t_{lab}$).\n\n1.  **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau$):** The lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame is called the proper lifetime. It is related to the particle's decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    $L = v \\cdot t_{lab}$\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** Because the particle is moving at a relativistic speed, its lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab. This is known as time dilation. The lab-frame lifetime is related to the proper lifetime by the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):\n    $t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Distance ($L$):** The velocity is often expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, $v = \\beta c$. Combining these concepts, the formula for the mean decay distance becomes:\n    $L = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau) = \\beta\\gamma c \\tau$\n\n4.  **Using Decay Width:** We can substitute the expression for the proper lifetime ($\\tau = \\hbar/\\Gamma$) into the equation:\n    $L = \\beta\\gamma \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n    This is the most convenient formula for this problem.

Understand the Goal and Physical Principles\n\nThe objective is to calculate the **mean decay distance (L)** of a relativistic particle (meson X) in the laboratory frame. This requires combining principles from special relativity and quantum mechanics.\n\n*   **Proper Lifetime and Decay Width:** The particle's lifetime in its own rest frame (proper lifetime, τ) is inversely proportional to its decay width (Γ), a relationship derived from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    `τ = ħ / Γ`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n*   **Time Dilation and Decay Distance:** Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is longer (`γτ`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor). The distance it travels is its velocity (`v`) multiplied by this lab-frame lifetime.\n    `L = v * (γτ)`\n\n*   **Combined Formula:** Using `v = βc` (where `β` is the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light `c`), the formula becomes:\n    `L = γβcτ = γβ * (ħc / Γ)`\n\nThis final form is the most direct way to solve the problem.\n\n### 2.

Find the momentum using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n    `(pc)² = E_X² - (m_X c²)²`\n    `(pc)² = (8 GeV)² - (1.2 GeV)² = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 GeV²`\n    `pc = √62.56 GeV ≈ 7.9095 GeV`\n\n2.  Use the relation `pc = γβ(mc²)`, which gives:\n    `γβ = pc / (m_X c²) = (√62.56 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ≈ 6.5912`\n\n**Step C: Calculate the Mean Decay Distance (L)**\nNow, substitute the values into the combined formula:\n`L = γβ * (ħc / Γ_X)`\n`L ≈ 6.5912 * (0.1973 GeV·fm / 0.320 GeV)`\nThe GeV units cancel out, leaving the result in femtometers (fm).\n`L ≈ 6.5912 * (0.61656 fm)`\n`L ≈ 4.0655 fm`\n\n**Step D: Convert to Meters**\nSince 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m, the mean decay distance is:\n`L ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m`\n\n### 3.

However, the physics and the resulting numerical value are consistent across the majority of correct derivations.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Unit Consistency:** Converting the decay width from MeV to GeV is essential.\n*   **Relativistic Formulas:** Using the full relativistic expressions for momentum and the decay distance is required.\n*   **Exponent Check:** The final answer must be carefully checked against the options, paying close attention to the exponent (10⁻¹⁵ vs. 10⁻¹⁶).\n\nThe calculation is robust and the result clearly corresponds to one of the options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Concepts\n\nThe problem asks for the **mean decay distance** ($L$) of a relativistic particle. This is the average distance the particle travels in the laboratory's frame of reference before it decays. The key concepts are:\n\n*   **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau$):** The lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame. It is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: $\\tau = \\hbar / \\Gamma$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **Time Dilation:** To an observer in the lab, the particle's lifetime appears longer due to its high speed. This lab-frame lifetime ($t_{lab}$) is given by $t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Mean Decay Distance ($L$):** This is the particle's velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime. It is most conveniently expressed using the formula:\n    $L = \\gamma \\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\beta = v/c$ is the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light, and $\\hbar c$ is a useful physical constant.\n\n### 2. Deriving the Calculation Formula\n\nTo use the formula above, we need to find the term $\\gamma\\beta$. This can be calculated directly from the particle's total energy ($E_X$) and its rest mass energy ($m_X c^2$) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E_X^2 = (p_X c)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$.\n\n1.  The momentum is given by $p_X = \\gamma m_X v = \\gamma m_X (\\beta c)$.\n2.  Therefore, $p_X c = \\gamma\\beta (m_X c^2)$.\n3.  From the energy-momentum relation, we can find $p_X c = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$.\n4.  Combining these, we get $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2}$.\n5.  Substituting this back into the formula for $L$ gives the most direct calculation path:\n    $L = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\right) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n### 3.

The minor discrepancies in the final numerical values across the different answers are attributable to rounding or slight variations in the physical constants used. The core physics and mathematical approach are sound.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Concepts and Formula\nThe goal is to find the mean decay distance ($L$) of a relativistic particle. This distance is the particle's velocity in the lab frame ($v$) multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame ($t_{lab}$).\n\n1.  **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau$):** The particle's lifetime in its own rest frame is determined by its decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) via the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Lab Frame Lifetime ($t_{lab}$):** Due to relativistic time dilation, the lifetime observed in the lab is longer by a factor of $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor):\n    $t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Distance ($L$):** The distance is velocity times time.

The correct physical formula to use is:\n`L = (pc / mc²) * (ħc / Γ)`\nwhere:\n*   `L` is the mean decay distance in the lab frame.\n*   `pc` is the particle's momentum multiplied by the speed of light, calculated from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `pc = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²)`.\n*   `mc²` is the particle's rest mass energy.\n*   `ħc` is a physical constant (reduced Planck constant times the speed of light).\n*   `Γ` is the particle's decay width.\n\n**Execution and Result**\n\nThe Python code implemented this formula correctly.\n1.  It first calculated the momentum `pc` using the given energy (8 GeV) and mass (1.2 GeV), resulting in `pc ≈ 7909.5 MeV`.\n2.  It then used this momentum, the mass, the decay width (320 MeV), and the constant `ħc` (197.327 MeV·fm) to calculate the mean decay distance.\n3.

The minor difference (~0.02%) is negligible and arises from the specific precision used for the physical constant `ħc`. The other options are incorrect by orders of magnitude or have a significantly different value. Therefore, the calculation confirms that C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Goal and Necessary Formulas\nThe objective is to calculate the **mean decay distance (L)** of the meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\nThe key formulas required are:\n1.  The relationship between the mean decay distance (L), the particle's velocity (v), and its lifetime in the lab frame (t_lab):\n    $L = v \\cdot t_{lab}$\n2.  The relationship between the lab-frame lifetime (t_lab) and the proper lifetime (τ, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) due to time dilation:\n    $t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$, where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n3.  The relationship between the proper lifetime (τ) and the decay width (Γ) from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nCombining these formulas gives the most direct equation for the mean decay distance:\n$L = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau) = \\beta\\gamma \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\nwhere $\\beta = v/c$ and c is the speed of light.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Relativistic Term (βγ)\nThe term βγ can be calculated directly from the particle's total energy (E) and rest mass energy (mc²).\nFrom the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, we can find the momentum term, $pc$.\n$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$\n\nThe momentum is also defined as $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m (\\beta c)$, which gives $pc = \\beta\\gamma (mc^2)$.\nTherefore, we can calculate βγ as:\n$\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n$\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{\\sqrt{(8 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (1.2 \\text{ GeV})^2}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{64 - 1.44}}{1.2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62.56}}{1.2} \\approx \\frac{7.9095}{1.2} \\approx 6.5912$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Decay Length Term (ħc / Γ)\nThis term requires consistent units. We will use the decay width in MeV and the physical constant ħc in units of MeV·fm.\n*   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (where 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m)\n\n$\\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X} = \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 0.61665 \\text{ fm}$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Mean Decay Distance (L)\nNow, we multiply the results from Step 2 and Step 3:\n$L = (\\beta\\gamma) \\cdot (\\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X})$\n$L \\approx (6.5912) \\cdot (0.61665 \\text{ fm})$\n$L \\approx 4.0655 \\text{ fm}$\n\n### Step 5: Convert to Meters and Select the Correct Option\nSince 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m, the mean decay distance is:\n$L \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nB) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nC) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\nD) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nThe calculated value matches option C exactly.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Unit Consistency:** The decay width is given in MeV, while the energy and mass are in GeV. It is crucial to convert them to a consistent unit before performing calculations.\n*   **Time Dilation:** The decay distance must be calculated using the particle's lifetime in the lab frame ($t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$), not its proper lifetime (τ).\n*   **Use of ħc:** Using the combined constant ħc (in units like MeV·fm) simplifies the calculation and helps avoid rounding errors that can occur when using separate values for ħ and c.\n*   **Order of Magnitude:** The options differ by an order of magnitude (10⁻¹⁵ vs. 10⁻¹⁶). Using ħc in MeV·fm naturally yields a result in femtometers (10⁻¹⁵ m), which helps confirm the correct order of magnitude.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the candidate answers, despite confusion in labeling the final option, correctly calculate the numerical value to be approximately 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the methods and careful points from the provided answers.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Concepts\n\nThe goal is to find the **mean decay distance (L)** of a particle in the laboratory frame. This is the average distance the particle travels before it decays. The calculation involves several key principles of relativistic physics:\n\n*   **Proper Lifetime (τ):** This is the average lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. It is inversely related to the particle's **decay width (Γ)** through the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The formula is `τ = ħ / Γ`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **Time Dilation:** From the perspective of the laboratory, the moving particle's lifetime appears longer than its proper lifetime. This lab-frame lifetime (`t_lab`) is given by `t_lab = γ * τ`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Mean Decay Distance (L):** The distance is simply the particle's velocity (`v`) multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame. The velocity is often written as `v = βc`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    `L = v * t_lab = (βc) * (γτ) = γβcτ`\n\n### 2. Deriving the Calculation Formula\n\nCombining the concepts above gives the primary formula for the mean decay distance:\n`L = γβ * c * (ħ / Γ)`\n\nThis can be rearranged into a more convenient form for calculation using the combined physical constant `ħc`:\n`L = γβ * (ħc / Γ)`\n\nThe term `γβ` can be calculated directly from the particle's total energy (E) and rest mass energy (mc²) without needing to find `γ` and `β` individually.\n\n*   From the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n*   The momentum `p` is also given by `p = γmv = γm(βc)`, which means `pc = γβ(mc²)`.\n*   Solving for `γβ`, we get: `γβ = pc / mc² = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²) / mc²`\n\nSubstituting this back into the formula for L gives the most direct calculation path:\n`L = (sqrt(E² - (mc²)²) / mc²) * (ħc / Γ)`\n\n### 3.

We will convert the decay width from MeV to GeV:\n*   Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.320 GeV\n\n**Physical Constant:**\n*   `ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm = 0.1973 GeV·fm` (where 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m)\n\n**Step A: Calculate the momentum term, `pc`**\n`pc = sqrt(E_X² - (m_X c²)²) = sqrt((8 GeV)² - (1.2 GeV)²) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) GeV = sqrt(62.56) GeV`\n`pc ≈ 7.9095 GeV`\n\n**Step B: Calculate the `γβ` term**\n`γβ = pc / (m_X c²) = 7.9095 GeV / 1.2 GeV ≈ 6.5912`\n\n**Step C: Calculate the mean decay distance, L**\nUsing the formula `L = γβ * (ħc / Γ_X)`:\n`L ≈ 6.5912 * (0.1973 GeV·fm / 0.320 GeV)`\nThe GeV units cancel out, leaving the result in femtometers (fm).\n`L ≈ 6.5912 * (0.61656 fm)`\n`L ≈ 4.0645 fm`\n\n**Careful Point 2: Final Unit Conversion**\nThe result is in femtometers. To compare with the options, we convert it to meters.\n*   Since 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m:\n    `L ≈ 4.0645 x 10⁻¹⁵ m`\n\n### 4.

Now we compare this to the given options:\n\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\nB) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\nC) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nD) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n\nOur calculated value is extremely close to option B. The minor difference (about 0.02%) is attributable to the precision of the physical constants used (e.g., the value of `ħc`).\n\n**Careful Point 3: Order of Magnitude**\nIt is crucial to distinguish between the exponents `10⁻¹⁵` and `10⁻¹⁶`. Our calculation clearly results in an answer on the order of `10⁻¹⁵` m, which eliminates options A and D.
