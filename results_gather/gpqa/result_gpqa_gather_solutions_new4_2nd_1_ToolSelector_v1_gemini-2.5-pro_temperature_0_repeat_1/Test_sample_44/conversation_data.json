The energy for a single particle in the n-th quantum level is given by `E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)`. The problem defines the base energy unit as `E = π²ħ² / 2mL²`. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels are:\n    *   `E₁ = 1²E = E`\n    *   `E₂ = 2²E = 4E`\n    *   `E₃ = 3²E = 9E`\n    *   `E₄ = 4²E = 16E`\n    *   and so on.\n\n2.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:**\n    The four particles are identical and have spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by both its spatial quantum number (`n`) and its spin quantum number (`m_s`, which can be spin-up or spin-down). This implies that each spatial energy level `E_n` can hold a maximum of two particles.\n\n3.  **Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    To find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n    *   Two particles go into the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is `2 × E₁ = 2E`.\n    *   The remaining two particles go into the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is `2 × E₂ = 2 × 4E = 8E`.\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum: `E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n4.  **First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy is the sum: `E_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n5.  **Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider all possible low-energy excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest total energy.\n    *   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n    *   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n    *   **Other possibilities for excitation:**\n        *   **Option A:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The configuration is {1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. The energy is `(1×E) + (2×4E) + (1×9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n        *   **Option B:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. The configuration is {2 in n=1, 2 in n=3}. The energy is `(2×E) + (2×9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n        *   **Option C:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The configuration is {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}. The energy is `(2×E) + (1×4E) + (1×16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n    *   Comparing the total energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, `E_2nd = 18E`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Fermions vs. Bosons:** The most critical aspect is recognizing that spin-1/2 particles are fermions and obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. If they were bosons, all four particles would occupy the `n=1` state, leading to a completely different result (ground state energy of 4E).\n*   **State Occupancy:** Due to spin, each spatial energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles. Forgetting this and allowing only one particle per level is a common error.\n*   **Identifying the Second Excited State:** This is the most complex step. It is not necessarily the \"next jump up\" (like `n=2` to `n=4`). One must systematically list the energies of all possible low-energy configurations and order them. The lowest energy excitation from the ground state is not always from the highest occupied level; promoting from a lower level (`n=1` to `n=3`) can result in a lower total energy than other promotions (`n=2` to `n=4`).\n*   **Matching to Options:** After correctly calculating the sequence of energies (10E, 15E, 18E), it is crucial to carefully match it to the given choices. Many of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed at this final step.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the System and Fundamental Principles\n\n1.  **Particles:** The system contains four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**.\n2.  **Governing Rule:** As fermions, these particles must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n3.  **Quantum State:** For a particle in this potential well, a quantum state is defined by two numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (which can be spin-up, +1/2, or spin-down, -1/2).\n4.  **Energy Level Occupancy:** Because there are two possible spin states for each energy level `n`, a maximum of **two** fermions can occupy any given energy level `E_n`.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well are given by `E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as `E = π²ħ² / 2mL²`.\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels can be written simply as:\n*   `E₁ = 1²E = E`\n*   `E₂ = 2²E = 4E`\n*   `E₃ = 3²E = 9E`\n*   `E₄ = 4²E = 16E`\n*   and so on.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Ground State Energy\n\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions.\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy E):** We place the first two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy 4E):** We place the remaining two particles here.\nThe total energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n`E_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the First Excited State Energy\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest possible energy. This is achieved by making the smallest possible energy jump from the ground state. We promote one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\nThe total energy of this state is:\n`E_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Second Excited State Energy\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest energy after the first excited state. We must consider all possible low-energy promotions from the ground state and find the one with the third-lowest total energy.\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (achieved by promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3).\n*   **Other Possibilities for Excitation:**\n    1.  **Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3:** The configuration is {1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n        *   Energy = `(1 × E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    2.  **Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3:** The configuration is {2 in n=1, 2 in n=3}.\n        *   Energy = `(2 × E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n    3.  **Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4:** The configuration is {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}.\n        *   Energy = `(2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the total energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the **next lowest is 18E**. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n### Summary and Careful Points\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThe sequence of energies is **10E, 15E, 18E**. This matches option C.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Fermions vs. Bosons:** The most critical point is recognizing that spin-1/2 particles are fermions and obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. If they were bosons, all four particles would occupy the n=1 state, leading to a ground state energy of 4E.\n2.  **State Occupancy:** The Pauli Principle allows two fermions per energy level `n` because of the two possible spin states. A common mistake is to allow only one particle per level.\n3.  **Finding the Second Excited State:** This is the most complex step. It is not simply the \"next jump\" in quantum numbers. One must calculate the total energy for all plausible low-energy configurations and order them. The configuration with the third-lowest total energy is the second excited state. In this case, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 (total energy 18E) results in a lower total energy than promoting a second particle from n=2 to n=3 (total energy 20E).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Particle Type and Governing Principles:**\n    *   The system contains four identical **spin-1/2 particles**. Particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**.\n    *   Fermions must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n    *   A quantum state in this system is defined by two quantum numbers: the spatial energy level `n` and the spin `m_s` (spin-up or spin-down).\n    *   Therefore, each spatial energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles (one with spin-up and one with spin-down).\n\n2.  **Determine Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n    *   The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by `E_n = n^2 * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\n    *   The problem defines the base energy unit as `E = π²ħ² / 2mL²`.\n    *   Thus, the single-particle energy levels are:\n        *   `E_1 = 1²E = E`\n        *   `E_2 = 2²E = 4E`\n        *   `E_3 = 3²E = 9E`\n        *   `E_4 = 4²E = 16E`\n        *   and so on.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    *   To find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four fermions.\n    *   **Level n=1:** Place two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down).

We must systematically consider all possible low-energy promotions from the ground state and order them by total energy.\n    *   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n    *   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (from promoting n=2 → n=3)\n    *   **Other possibilities for excitation:**\n        *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The configuration is {1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n            *   Energy = `(1×E) + (2×4E) + (1×9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n        *   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. The configuration is {2 in n=1, 2 in n=3}.\n            *   Energy = `(2×E) + (2×9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n        *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.

Particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**.\n    *   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** This is the most important principle for this problem. It states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n    *   **Quantum State:** For a particle in this 1D well, a quantum state is defined by two numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be spin-up, +1/2, or spin-down, -1/2).\n    *   **State Occupancy:** Because there are two possible spin states for each energy level `n`, a maximum of **two** fermions can occupy any given energy level `E_n`.\n\n2.  **Define the Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n    *   The energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well are given by `E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\n    *   The problem defines the base energy unit as `E = π²ħ² / 2mL²`.\n    *   Therefore, we can express the single-particle energy levels simply as `E_n = n²E`.\n        *   `E_1 = 1²E = E`\n        *   `E_2 = 2²E = 4E`\n        *   `E_3 = 3²E = 9E`\n        *   `E_4 = 4²E = 16E`\n        *   and so on.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    *   The ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy.

If they were bosons, all four particles would occupy the `n=1` state, leading to a completely different answer (ground state energy of 4E).\n*   **Energy Level Spacing:** The energy levels are not evenly spaced; they grow as `n²`. This is why promoting a particle from `n=1` to `n=3` (costing `E_3 - E_1 = 8E`) is a different excitation than promoting from `n=2` to `n=4` (costing `E_4 - E_2 = 12E`).\n*   **Finding Excited States:** To find the excited states in order, you must systematically consider all possible low-energy promotions from the ground state and rank them by their total energy.

The solution requires applying the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\nFirst, we define the energy levels for a single particle in the potential well. The energy `E_n` for a particle in the n-th quantum state is given by:\n`E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)`, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as `E = π²ħ² / 2mL²`. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be simplified to:\n*   `E_1 = 1²E = E`\n*   `E_2 = 2²E = 4E`\n*   `E_3 = 3²E = 9E`\n*   `E_4 = 4²E = 16E`\n... and so on.\n\n**2. Applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\nThe particles are specified as spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. The Pauli Exclusion Principle dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state in this system is defined by both its energy level (`n`) and its spin (`m_s`, which can be spin-up or spin-down). This crucial rule means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles.\n\n**3. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. To find this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four particles:\n*   **Level n=1:** We place two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is `2 × E_1 = 2E`.\n*   **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two particles here. Their combined energy is `2 × E_2 = 2 × 4E = 8E`.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n`E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n**4. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy for this state is:\n`E_1st = (2 × E_1) + (1 × E_2) + (1 × E_3) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n**5. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider various possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (achieved by promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3).\n*   **Other possibilities for excitation:**\n    *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration is: one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n        *   Energy = `(1 × E_1) + (2 × E_2) + (1 × E_3) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration is: two particles in n=1 and two in n=3.\n        *   Energy = `(2 × E_1) + (2 × E_3) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration is: two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n        *   Energy = `(2 × E_1) + (1 × E_2) + (1 × E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the second excited state has an energy of `18E`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Fermions vs. Bosons:** The most critical aspect is identifying spin-1/2 particles as fermions that obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. If they were bosons, all four particles would occupy the n=1 state for a ground state energy of 4E.\n2.  **State Occupancy:** A quantum state includes both the spatial level (`n`) and spin. This is why two, not one, fermions can occupy each spatial energy level.\n3.  **Finding Excited States:** To find the first, second, etc., excited states, one must be systematic.

This is incorrect because spin-1/2 particles are fermions.\n*   **Systematic Search for Excited States:** It is crucial to systematically list the possible excited configurations and their energies to correctly identify the first and second excited states in order.\n\nThe analysis confirms that the correct sequence of energies is 10E, 15E, and 18E.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Fundamental Principles:**\n    *   **Particles:** The system contains four identical spin-1/2 particles.

Energy contribution: `2 × E₁ = 2E`.\n    *   **Level n=2:** Place the remaining two particles. Energy contribution: `2 × E₂ = 2 × 4E = 8E`.\n    *   **Total Ground State Energy:** `E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    *   The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n    *   **Total First Excited State Energy:** `E_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    *   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy.

A common mistake is to treat them as bosons, which would place all four particles in the n=1 state, leading to an incorrect ground state energy of 4E.\n2.  **State Occupancy:** A quantum state includes both the spatial level (`n`) and spin. This is why two, not one, fermions can occupy each spatial energy level.\n3.  **Systematic Search for Excited States:** To correctly identify the excited states in order, one must systematically list the possible configurations and their total energies. The second excited state is not necessarily the \"next jump up\" in quantum numbers (e.g., n=2 to n=4), but rather the configuration with the third-lowest total energy. In this case, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 results in a lower total energy (18E) than other possibilities like promoting a second particle from n=2 to n=3 (20E).\n4.  **Matching Calculation to Options:** An analysis of the candidate answers shows that while the vast majority correctly calculated the energy values (10E, 15E, 18E), many failed at the final step of matching this sequence to the correct multiple-choice letter. This highlights the importance of careful final checking.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are **10E, 15E, and 18E**, respectively. This sequence correctly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n>>>",

The energy for a single particle in the n-th quantum level is given by `E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)`. The problem defines the base energy unit as `E = π²ħ² / 2mL²`. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels are:\n    *   `E₁ = 1²E = E`\n    *   `E₂ = 2²E = 4E`\n    *   `E₃ = 3²E = 9E`\n    *   `E₄ = 4²E = 16E`\n    *   and so on.\n\n2.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:**\n    The four particles are identical and have spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by both its spatial quantum number (`n`) and its spin quantum number (`m_s`, which can be spin-up or spin-down). This implies that each spatial energy level `E_n` can hold a maximum of two particles.\n\n3.  **Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    To find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n    *   Two particles go into the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is `2 × E₁ = 2E`.\n    *   The remaining two particles go into the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is `2 × E₂ = 2 × 4E = 8E`.\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum: `E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n4.  **First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy is the sum: `E_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n5.  **Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider all possible low-energy excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest total energy.\n    *   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n    *   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n    *   **Other possibilities for excitation:**\n        *   **Option A:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The configuration is {1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. The energy is `(1×E) + (2×4E) + (1×9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n        *   **Option B:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. The configuration is {2 in n=1, 2 in n=3}. The energy is `(2×E) + (2×9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n        *   **Option C:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The configuration is {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}. The energy is `(2×E) + (1×4E) + (1×16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n    *   Comparing the total energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, `E_2nd = 18E`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Fermions vs. Bosons:** The most critical aspect is recognizing that spin-1/2 particles are fermions and obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. If they were bosons, all four particles would occupy the `n=1` state, leading to a completely different result (ground state energy of 4E).\n*   **State Occupancy:** Due to spin, each spatial energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles. Forgetting this and allowing only one particle per level is a common error.\n*   **Identifying the Second Excited State:** This is the most complex step. It is not necessarily the \"next jump up\" (like `n=2` to `n=4`). One must systematically list the energies of all possible low-energy configurations and order them. The lowest energy excitation from the ground state is not always from the highest occupied level; promoting from a lower level (`n=1` to `n=3`) can result in a lower total energy than other promotions (`n=2` to `n=4`).\n*   **Matching to Options:** After correctly calculating the sequence of energies (10E, 15E, 18E), it is crucial to carefully match it to the given choices. Many of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed at this final step.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the System and Fundamental Principles\n\n1.  **Particles:** The system contains four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**.\n2.  **Governing Rule:** As fermions, these particles must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n3.  **Quantum State:** For a particle in this potential well, a quantum state is defined by two numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (which can be spin-up, +1/2, or spin-down, -1/2).\n4.  **Energy Level Occupancy:** Because there are two possible spin states for each energy level `n`, a maximum of **two** fermions can occupy any given energy level `E_n`.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well are given by `E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as `E = π²ħ² / 2mL²`.\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels can be written simply as:\n*   `E₁ = 1²E = E`\n*   `E₂ = 2²E = 4E`\n*   `E₃ = 3²E = 9E`\n*   `E₄ = 4²E = 16E`\n*   and so on.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Ground State Energy\n\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions.\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy E):** We place the first two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy 4E):** We place the remaining two particles here.\nThe total energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n`E_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the First Excited State Energy\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest possible energy. This is achieved by making the smallest possible energy jump from the ground state. We promote one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\nThe total energy of this state is:\n`E_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Second Excited State Energy\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest energy after the first excited state. We must consider all possible low-energy promotions from the ground state and find the one with the third-lowest total energy.\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (achieved by promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3).\n*   **Other Possibilities for Excitation:**\n    1.  **Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3:** The configuration is {1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n        *   Energy = `(1 × E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    2.  **Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3:** The configuration is {2 in n=1, 2 in n=3}.\n        *   Energy = `(2 × E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n    3.  **Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4:** The configuration is {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}.\n        *   Energy = `(2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the total energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the **next lowest is 18E**. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n### Summary and Careful Points\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThe sequence of energies is **10E, 15E, 18E**. This matches option C.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Fermions vs. Bosons:** The most critical point is recognizing that spin-1/2 particles are fermions and obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. If they were bosons, all four particles would occupy the n=1 state, leading to a ground state energy of 4E.\n2.  **State Occupancy:** The Pauli Principle allows two fermions per energy level `n` because of the two possible spin states. A common mistake is to allow only one particle per level.\n3.  **Finding the Second Excited State:** This is the most complex step. It is not simply the \"next jump\" in quantum numbers. One must calculate the total energy for all plausible low-energy configurations and order them. The configuration with the third-lowest total energy is the second excited state. In this case, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 (total energy 18E) results in a lower total energy than promoting a second particle from n=2 to n=3 (total energy 20E).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Particle Type and Governing Principles:**\n    *   The system contains four identical **spin-1/2 particles**.

It states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n    *   **Quantum State:** For a particle in this 1D well, a quantum state is defined by two numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be spin-up, +1/2, or spin-down, -1/2).\n    *   **State Occupancy:** Because there are two possible spin states for each energy level `n`, a maximum of **two** fermions can occupy any given energy level `E_n`.\n\n2.  **Define the Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n    *   The energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well are given by `E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\n    *   The problem defines the base energy unit as `E = π²ħ² / 2mL²`.\n    *   Therefore, we can express the single-particle energy levels simply as `E_n = n²E`.\n        *   `E_1 = 1²E = E`\n        *   `E_2 = 2²E = 4E`\n        *   `E_3 = 3²E = 9E`\n        *   `E_4 = 4²E = 16E`\n        *   and so on.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    *   The ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   **Level n=1 (Energy E):** Place the first two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   **Level n=2 (Energy 4E):** Place the remaining two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   The total energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n        `E_ground = (2 × E_1) + (2 × E_2) = (2 × E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    *   The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by making the smallest possible energy \"jump\".\n    *   We promote one particle from the highest occupied level in the ground state (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy is:\n        `E_1st = (2 × E_1) + (1 × E_2) + (1 × E_3) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    *   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We must consider all possible low-energy promotions from the ground state and order them by total energy.\n    *   **Possibility 1 (First Excited State):** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. Total Energy = **15E**.\n    *   **Possibility 2:** Promote one particle from a lower level, `n=1`, to the lowest empty level, `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: 1 particle in `n=1`, 2 particles in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=3`.\n        *   Energy: `(1 × E_1) + (2 × E_2) + (1 × E_3) = E + (2 × 4E) + 9E = E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Possibility 3:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: 2 particles in `n=1`, 2 particles in `n=3`.\n        *   Energy: `(2 × E_1) + (2 × E_3) = (2 × E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n    *   Comparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.\n    *   Therefore, the second excited state energy is `E_2nd = 18E`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Fermions vs. Bosons:** It is crucial to recognize that spin-1/2 particles are fermions and obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. If they were bosons, all four particles would occupy the `n=1` state, leading to a completely different answer (ground state energy of 4E).\n*   **Energy Level Spacing:** The energy levels are not evenly spaced; they grow as `n²`. This is why promoting a particle from `n=1` to `n=3` (costing `E_3 - E_1 = 8E`) is a different excitation than promoting from `n=2` to `n=4` (costing `E_4 - E_2 = 12E`).\n*   **Finding Excited States:** To find the excited states in order, you must systematically consider all possible low-energy promotions from the ground state and rank them by their total energy. The second excited state is not necessarily a promotion from the first excited state, but rather the third-lowest energy configuration overall.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe calculated energies are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Fundamental Principles\n1.  **System:** The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles.\n2.  **Particle Type:** Spin-1/2 particles are **fermions**.\n3.  **Governing Rule:** Identical fermions must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**.

One must compare the total energies of all plausible low-energy configurations to find the correct one, which is 18E in this case.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most of them perform the calculation correctly, many fail to match the final result (10E, 15E, 18E) to the correct multiple-choice option. The correct match is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Single-Particle Energy Levels\nThe system is a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy for a single particle in the n-th quantum level is given by:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle\nThe system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by both its spatial quantum number (`n`) and its spin quantum number (`m_s`, which can be spin-up or spin-down).\nThis means each spatial energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Ground State Energy ($E_{ground}$)\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   **Level n=1:** We place two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).

This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\nThe total energy of this state is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\bf{15E}$\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy.

The configuration is: two particles in `n=1` and two in `n=3`.\n        Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = 2E + 2(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=4`.\n        Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the second excited state has an energy of **18E**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe energies of the three states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the System and Fundamental Principles\n1.  **Particles:** The system contains four identical spin-1/2 particles.

The solution requires applying the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\nFirst, we define the energy levels for a single particle in the potential well. The energy `E_n` for a particle in the n-th quantum state is given by:\n`E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)`, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as `E = π²ħ² / 2mL²`. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be simplified to:\n*   `E_1 = 1²E = E`\n*   `E_2 = 2²E = 4E`\n*   `E_3 = 3²E = 9E`\n*   `E_4 = 4²E = 16E`\n... and so on.\n\n**2. Applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\nThe particles are specified as spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. The Pauli Exclusion Principle dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state in this system is defined by both its energy level (`n`) and its spin (`m_s`, which can be spin-up or spin-down). This crucial rule means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles.\n\n**3. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. To find this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four particles:\n*   **Level n=1:** We place two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is `2 × E_1 = 2E`.\n*   **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two particles here. Their combined energy is `2 × E_2 = 2 × 4E = 8E`.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n`E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n**4. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy for this state is:\n`E_1st = (2 × E_1) + (1 × E_2) + (1 × E_3) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n**5. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider various possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (achieved by promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3).\n*   **Other possibilities for excitation:**\n    *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration is: one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n        *   Energy = `(1 × E_1) + (2 × E_2) + (1 × E_3) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration is: two particles in n=1 and two in n=3.\n        *   Energy = `(2 × E_1) + (2 × E_3) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration is: two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n        *   Energy = `(2 × E_1) + (1 × E_2) + (1 × E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the second excited state has an energy of `18E`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Fermions vs. Bosons:** The most critical aspect is identifying spin-1/2 particles as fermions that obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. If they were bosons, all four particles would occupy the n=1 state for a ground state energy of 4E.\n2.  **State Occupancy:** A quantum state includes both the spatial level (`n`) and spin. This is why two, not one, fermions can occupy each spatial energy level.\n3.  **Finding Excited States:** To find the first, second, etc., excited states, one must be systematic.

Particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**.\n2.  **Governing Principle:** As identical fermions, these particles must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n3.  **Quantum State Definition:** For a particle in a 1D infinite potential well, the quantum state is defined by two numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (which can be spin-up, +1/2, or spin-down, -1/2).\n4.  **Energy Level Occupancy:** Because of the two possible spin states, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles (one with spin-up and one with spin-down).\n5.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well is `E_n = n² * (π²ħ²/2mL²)`. Given the problem's definition of `E = π²ħ²/2mL²`, the energy levels are simplified to `E_n = n²E`.\n    *   `E₁ = 1²E = E`\n    *   `E₂ = 2²E = 4E`\n    *   `E₃ = 3²E = 9E`\n    *   `E₄ = 4²E = 16E`\n    *   ...and so on.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**1. Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four fermions.\n*   **n=1 level:** Place two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is `2 × E₁ = 2 × E = 2E`.\n*   **n=2 level:** Place the remaining two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is `2 × E₂ = 2 × 4E = 8E`.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:** `E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n**2. First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:** `E_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n**3. Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest energy. We must consider all possible low-energy promotions from the ground state and find the one with the second-smallest energy increase.\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (promotion from n=2 to n=3)\n*   **Other possibilities for excitation:**\n    *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration is {1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n        *   Energy = `(1 × E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration is {2 in n=1, 2 in n=3}.\n        *   Energy = `(2 × E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration is {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}.\n        *   Energy = `(2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the total energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy:** `E_2nd = 18E`.\n\n### Conclusion and Careful Points\n\n*   **Calculated Energies:** The energies are 10E for the ground state, 15E for the first excited state, and 18E for the second excited state.\n*   **Matching with Options:** This sequence of energies, `10E, 15E, 18E`, corresponds to option A.\n*   **Critical Mistake to Avoid:** A common error is to treat the particles as bosons, which would place all four in the n=1 state for a ground state energy of 4E. This is incorrect because spin-1/2 particles are fermions.\n*   **Systematic Search for Excited States:** It is crucial to systematically list the possible excited configurations and their energies to correctly identify the first and second excited states in order.\n\nThe analysis confirms that the correct sequence of energies is 10E, 15E, and 18E.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Fundamental Principles:**\n    *   **Particles:** The system contains four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**.\n    *   **Governing Principle:** As fermions, these particles must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n    *   **Quantum State Definition:** For a particle in this potential well, a quantum state is fully described by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be spin-up, +1/2, or spin-down, -1/2).\n    *   **State Occupancy:** Because there are two possible spin states for each energy level `n`, a maximum of two fermions can occupy any given energy level.\n\n2.  **Define Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n    *   The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy for a single particle in the n-th level is given by:\n        `E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)` where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n    *   The problem defines the base energy unit as `E = (π²ħ² / 2mL²)`.\n    *   Therefore, we can express the single-particle energy levels simply as:\n        *   `E₁ = 1²E = E`\n        *   `E₂ = 2²E = 4E`\n        *   `E₃ = 3²E = 9E`\n        *   `E₄ = 4²E = 16E`\n        *   and so on.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    *   The ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We achieve this by filling the energy levels from the bottom up with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   **Level n=1 (Energy E):** We place the first two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   **Level n=2 (Energy 4E):** We place the remaining two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n        `E_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    *   The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`).\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy of the first excited state is:\n        `E_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    *   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We must consider all possible low-energy promotions from the ground state and order them by total energy.\n    *   The ground state energy is 10E. The first excited state energy is 15E.\n    *   Let's consider other possible excitations:\n        *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n            Energy = `(1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n        *   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes: two particles in `n=1` and two in `n=3`.\n            Energy = `(2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n        *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The configuration becomes: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=4`.\n            Energy = `(2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n    *   Comparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the **next lowest is 18E**.\n    *   Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is `18E`.\n\n### Summary of Results\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThis set of energies corresponds to option A.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Fermions vs. Bosons:** The most critical step is recognizing that spin-1/2 particles are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. If they were bosons, all four particles would occupy the n=1 state for a ground state energy of 4E.\n*   **State Occupancy:** Because a quantum state includes both the energy level (`n`) and spin (`m_s`), each energy level can hold two fermions (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Finding Excited States:** To find the first, second, etc., excited states, one must be systematic. It's not enough to find just any excited state; one must find the configurations with the lowest, second-lowest, etc., total energies above the ground state. This requires comparing the energies of different possible particle promotions.\n*   **Matching to Options:** As seen in the candidate answers, a common mistake is to perform the calculation correctly but then select the wrong multiple-choice letter. The calculated result (10E, 15E, 18E) must be carefully matched to the given options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",
