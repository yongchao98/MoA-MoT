This is the most critical piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator, and any measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum *must* yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Desired Measurement Outcome:**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific joint measurement outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of the first electron's $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of the second electron's $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state is described in the uncoupled basis as $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    The core physical principle that governs this problem is the addition of angular momentum. A fundamental selection rule arises from this principle: the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of its individual parts.\n    *   As an operator equation: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   This implies a strict rule for their quantum numbers: **$m = m_1 + m_2$**.\n    A coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number $m$ is a superposition of only those uncoupled states for which the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) equals $m$. Any outcome violating this rule has zero probability.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state, using the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.

This means the desired measurement outcome is physically impossible given the initial state. The system is known to have a total $L_z$ value of $-1\\hbar$, so it cannot be found in a state with a total $L_z$ value of $-2\\hbar$. Therefore, the probability of this event occurring is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points and Analysis of Candidate Answers\n*   **Universal Correct Reasoning**: All 15 candidate answers correctly identify and apply the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum ($m = m_1 + m_2$) as the decisive step.\n*   **Unanimous Conclusion**: Every candidate's reasoning leads to the correct physical conclusion that the probability is 0.\n*   **Final Answer Discrepancy**: The candidate answers differ in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D).

The key to solving this lies in the rules for the addition of angular momentum.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State and its Properties:**\n    The system is in the coupled state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This notation tells us several things:\n    *   Each electron is in a p-orbital, so their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$.\n    *   The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n    *   Most importantly for this problem, the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum is **$m = -1$**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome (Final State):**\n    A joint measurement is performed on the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of obtaining:\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$, which corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$, which corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum (The Selection Rule):**\n    A fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the simple sum of the individual z-components. The operator relationship is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This implies a strict conservation rule for their corresponding quantum numbers, which acts as a selection rule:\n    **$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n    This rule means that the initial coupled state with total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only be composed of uncoupled states for which the sum of individual quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) is equal to $m$. Any measurement outcome that violates this rule is physically impossible.\n\n4.  **Check if the Desired Outcome is Possible:**\n    We must compare the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state with the sum required by the final measurement outcome.\n    *   From the initial state: $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired final state: the sum is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Probability:**\n    We check if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied:\n    Is $-1 = -2$? **No.**\n    The desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An initial state known to have a total $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$ cannot be measured and found in a final configuration whose components sum to an $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-2\\hbar$. The transition is forbidden. Therefore, the probability of observing this outcome is **0**.\n\nThis reasoning is correctly identified in all the provided candidate answers. The physical conclusion is unambiguous. Matching this result to the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 2/3\nC) 1/2\nD) 0\n\nThe calculated probability is 0, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe system is described in the *coupled basis* by the state ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. Let's break down what this means:\n*   **$l_1=1, l_2=1$**: This confirms that the two electrons are in p-orbitals, as the orbital angular momentum quantum number for a p-orbital is 1.\n*   **$l=2$**: This is the quantum number for the magnitude of the *total* orbital angular momentum of the two-electron system.\n*   **$m=-1$**: This is the magnetic quantum number for the *total* orbital angular momentum's projection onto the z-axis. This is the most critical piece of information for this problem. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. Any measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum on this state must yield $-1\\hbar$.\n\n### Step 2: Deconstruct the Desired Final State (The Measurement Outcome)\nThe problem asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome:\n*   The measurement of $L_{1z}$ for the first electron yields an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding the first electron in a state with individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n*   The measurement of $L_{2z}$ for the second electron yields an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding the second electron in a state with individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\nThis desired outcome corresponds to finding the system in the *uncoupled* state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law\nA core principle of adding angular momenta in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component. The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the direct sum of the individual operators:\n$L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\nThis relationship between the operators imposes a strict selection rule on their corresponding quantum numbers. For any possible measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1$ and $m_2$) must equal the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the initial state.\n**Selection Rule: $m = m_1 + m_2$**\n\nIf this condition is not met, the transition from the initial state to the final state is impossible.\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Desired Outcome is Possible\nLet's apply the selection rule to our specific case:\n*   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **$m = -1$**.\n*   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. Their sum is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\nNow, compare the initial requirement with the final outcome:\n$-1 \\neq -2$\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Probability\nSince $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the desired measurement outcome violates the law of conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. A system known to be in a state with a total z-component quantum number of $m=-1$ cannot be found in a state where the sum of its components is -2. Such an event is physically impossible.\n\nThe probability of a physically impossible event is 0.\n\nMore formally, the probability is the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient connecting the initial and final states: $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are, by definition, zero unless $m=m_1+m_2$. Therefore, the probability is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate solutions.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n*   **System:** A two-electron system.\n*   **Initial State:** The system is in a specific *coupled* angular momentum state, denoted as `|l₁, l₂, l, m⟩ = |1, 1, 2, -1⟩`. The important information from this notation is:\n    *   `l₁ = 1` and `l₂ = 1`: The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons.\n    *   `l = 2`: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the combined system.\n    *   `m = -1`: The magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum.\n*   **Measurement:** A joint measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of the angular momenta, `L₁z` and `L₂z`.\n*   **Desired Outcome:** We need to find the probability of getting an eigenvalue of `-ħ` for **both** `L₁z` and `L₂z`. An eigenvalue of `-ħ` corresponds to a magnetic quantum number of `-1`. Therefore, the desired final state has individual quantum numbers `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\n**2. Identification of the Core Physical Principle**\nAll candidate answers correctly identify that the solution relies on the principle of addition of angular momentum in quantum mechanics. The central tenet for this problem is the **conservation of the z-component of angular momentum**.\n\n*   The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum (`L_z`) is the simple sum of the individual operators: `L_z = L₁z + L₂z`.\n*   This relationship between the operators imposes a strict **selection rule** on their corresponding quantum numbers: `m = m₁ + m₂`.\n*   This rule means that a coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number `m` can only be formed from, or be measured to be in, uncoupled states where the sum `m₁ + m₂` equals `m`.\n\n**3. Application of the Principle and Key Analysis Points**\nLet's apply the selection rule, which is the most critical step:\n\n*   **Point 1: Identify the definite total 'm' from the initial state.** The initial state `|1, 1, 2, -1⟩` is an eigenstate of the total `L_z` operator. This means it has a definite, non-probabilistic total magnetic quantum number `m = -1`.\n*   **Point 2: Identify the total 'm' required for the final state.** The desired measurement outcome is `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`. The sum of these individual components is `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n*   **Point 3: Compare the initial and final total 'm'.** The initial state requires the sum of z-components to be `-1`, but the desired outcome has a sum of `-2`.\n*   **Point 4: Draw a conclusion based on the comparison.** Since `-1 ≠ -2`, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n**4. Determining the Probability**\nAn event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible. In quantum mechanics, the probability of a physically impossible event is exactly **0**.\n\nFormally, the probability is the squared magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `⟨l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂ | l, m⟩`. This coefficient is non-zero only if `m = m₁ + m₂`. Since this condition is violated, the coefficient `⟨1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1⟩` is zero, and thus the probability is also zero.\n\nAll provided candidate answers reach this same conclusion through their reasoning, even though several fail to map this correct result to the corresponding multiple-choice letter. Based on the physics, the answer is unambiguously 0.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a consensus of reasoning and a direct calculation.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State of the System**\n\n*   The system is composed of two electrons in p-orbitals, meaning their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n*   The system is described in the *coupled basis*, where the total angular momentum is specified. The state is given by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n*   The most important piece of information from the initial state is the magnetic quantum number for the *total* angular momentum, which is **m = -1**.\n*   This means the system is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. A measurement of the total $L_z$ on this system will always yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n**2. Understand the Measurement and the Desired Outcome**\n\n*   A joint measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum for each electron, namely $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n*   The question asks for the probability of obtaining the eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for **both** $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n*   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n*   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n*   Therefore, the desired final state is one where the system is found with $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\n**3. Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law**\n\n*   In the addition of angular momenta, the z-component is conserved. This is a fundamental law.\n*   The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n*   This physical law leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers: for any possible measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1$ and $m_2$) must equal the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the initial state.\n*   **The Selection Rule:** $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n**4. Check for Consistency**\n\n*   Let's check if the desired outcome is physically possible given the initial state and the conservation law.\n*   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be **m = -1**.\n*   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n*   The sum of these individual quantum numbers for the desired outcome is: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n**5. Conclusion on Probability**\n\n*   We compare the total quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) with the sum required by the final state ($m_1+m_2 = -2$).\n*   Since **-1 ≠ -2**, the desired outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n*   An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible.\n*   The probability of an impossible event is **0**.\n\n**Final Review:** All candidate agents, despite some confusion in mapping the result to a letter, correctly used this line of reasoning to conclude that the probability is 0. The physics is unambiguous. Based on the options provided (A) 0, (B) 1, (C) 1/2, (D) 2/3, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State and Its Properties**:\n    The system is composed of two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state given by the ket `|l₁, l₂, l, m⟩ = |1, 1, 2, -1⟩`. The most important property for this problem is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This value is definite, meaning the z-component of the *total* angular momentum of the system is precisely `-1ħ`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome**:\n    The question asks for the probability of jointly measuring the z-component of angular momentum for *each* electron and getting the eigenvalue `-ħ`.\n    *   For the first electron, `L₁z` eigenvalue `-ħ` corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number **m₁ = -1**.\n    *   For the second electron, `L₂z` eigenvalue `-ħ` corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number **m₂ = -1**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (Selection Rule)**:\n    In the quantum theory of angular momentum, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of its individual parts. This relationship holds for the operators (`L_z = L₁z + L₂z`) and consequently for their corresponding quantum numbers. This leads to a strict selection rule:\n    **m = m₁ + m₂**\n    This means that for a system in a state with a total magnetic quantum number `m`, any physically possible measurement of the individual components must yield `m₁` and `m₂` that sum to `m`.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**:\n    Let's check if the desired outcome is consistent with the initial state using the selection rule.\n    *   The initial state requires the sum of components to be `m = -1`.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome would have a sum of components of `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    We compare the required total from the initial state (`-1`) with the sum from the desired final state (`-2`).\n    Since **-1 ≠ -2**, the desired measurement outcome violates the law of conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible.\n\n6.  **Final Probability**:\n    The probability of a physically impossible event is exactly **0**. Formally, the initial state and the final state are eigenstates of the total angular momentum operator `L_z`, but with different eigenvalues (`-1ħ` and `-2ħ`, respectively). Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal, so the probability of transitioning from one to the other is zero.\n\nBased on the options provided in the question:\nA) 0\nB) 1\nC) 2/3\nD) 1/2\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on a synthesis of the provided candidate solutions.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State of the System**\nThe system is described by the ket vector $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This notation is for the *coupled basis*, where the individual angular momenta of the two electrons ($l_1=1$, $l_2=1$) are combined to form a total angular momentum for the system ($l=2$).\nThe most critical piece of information for this problem is the total magnetic quantum number, **$m = -1$**. This means the system is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n**2. Understand the Desired Final State (The Measurement Outcome)**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome:\n*   The eigenvalue for the first electron's z-component of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$, is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number of $m_1 = -1$.\n*   The eigenvalue for the second electron's z-component of angular momentum, $L_{2z}$, is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number of $m_2 = -1$.\n\nThis desired outcome would mean the system is found in a state that, in the *uncoupled basis*, has the individual quantum numbers $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n**3. Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (Selection Rule)**\nA core principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component is conserved. The total z-component is the sum of the individual z-components. This gives rise to a strict selection rule for the quantum numbers:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nThis rule means that a coupled state with total magnetic quantum number $m$ is a superposition of uncoupled states, but *only* those states for which the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1$ and $m_2$) sum up to $m$. Any combination of $(m_1, m_2)$ that does not sum to $m$ is not part of the initial state and cannot be measured.\n\n**4. Check if the Desired Outcome is Possible**\nLet's check if our desired measurement outcome satisfies this rule:\n*   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be **$m = -1$**.\n*   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\nNow, compare these two values. The conservation law requires $m = m_1 + m_2$. In our case, this means we must have:\n-1 = -2\nThis statement is false.\n\n**5. Determine the Probability**\nBecause the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it is a physically impossible event. An initial state with a total $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$ can never be measured to have a final total $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-2\\hbar$.\n\nThe probability of a physically impossible event is **0**.\n\n**Conclusion from Candidate Answers**\nAll 15 candidate answers present this exact line of reasoning and correctly conclude that the probability is 0. The discrepancies among them arise only when they attempt to map this numerical result to the multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D), with some agents making an error in this final step. The underlying physics, however, is unanimously agreed upon.\n\nGiven the options:\nA) 1\nB) 2/3\nC) 1/2\nD) 0\n\nThe calculated probability of 0 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the initial state of the system.**\nThe system is in the coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This notation tells us several things:\n*   The individual angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$.\n*   The total angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n*   The crucial piece of information is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum, which is **m = -1**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z$, and any measurement of this total quantity must yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the desired outcome of the measurement.**\nA measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the joint probability of the following outcome:\n*   The eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n*   The eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the fundamental law of angular momentum addition.**\nThe core principle needed to solve this problem is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The operator for the total z-component, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\nThis operator relationship leads to a strict selection rule for their corresponding quantum numbers: for any possible measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1$ and $m_2$) must be equal to the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the initial state.\nThe selection rule is: **$m = m_1 + m_2$**.\n\n**Step 4: Check if the desired outcome is physically possible.**\nWe check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state according to the selection rule.\n*   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is **$m = -1$**.\n*   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = **-2**$.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the values and conclude.**\nWe compare the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state with the sum required by the final state.\n*   Initial state requires: $m_{total} = -1$\n*   Final state requires: $m_{total} = -2$\nSince $-1 \\neq -2$, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.

This state is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. The crucial piece of information is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This means any measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum on this state must yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Desired Measurement Outcome**: The question asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome:\n    *   The measurement of $L_{1z}$ yields the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$.

This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number for the second electron, $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum**: A fundamental principle of adding angular momenta in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component. The operator relationship $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ leads to a strict selection rule for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    This rule states that the total magnetic quantum number of a coupled state must equal the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers of its constituent uncoupled states.

This coefficient is non-zero only if $m = m_1+m_2$. Since this condition is not met, the coefficient is zero, and thus the probability is 0.\n\nBased on the provided options:\nA) 2/3\nB) 0\nC) 1/2\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is 0.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Initial State**\nThe system is in the coupled angular momentum state `|l_1, l_2, l, m⟩ = |1, 1, 2, -1⟩`. This notation describes the combined state of two particles.\n*   `l_1=1` and `l_2=1` are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons (p-orbitals).\n*   `l=2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   `m=-1` is the total magnetic quantum number. This is the most crucial piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the operator for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum, `L_z`, with a definite eigenvalue of `mħ = -1ħ`.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Measurement and the Desired Outcome**\nA measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum for each electron, `L_{1z}` and `L_{2z}`. The question asks for the probability of a specific outcome:\n*   The eigenvalue for `L_{1z}` is `−ħ`. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number `m₁ = -1`.\n*   The eigenvalue for `L_{2z}` is `−ħ`. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number `m₂ = -1`.\nThis desired final state is described in the uncoupled basis as `|m₁, m₂⟩ = |-1, -1⟩`.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum**\nThis is the core physical principle that resolves the question. The total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. The operator relationship `L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}` implies a strict conservation rule for their corresponding quantum numbers, which acts as a selection rule:\n`m = m₁ + m₂`\n\nThis means that a coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number `m` can only be measured to be in an uncoupled state where the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers `(m₁ + m₂)` is equal to `m`.\n\n**Step 4: Check if the Desired Outcome is Physically Possible**\nWe must compare the total `m` of the initial state with the sum required by the final state.\n*   From the initial state `|1, 1, 2, -1⟩`, the total magnetic quantum number is **m = -1**.\n*   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is **m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2**.\n\nSince `-1 ≠ -2`, the selection rule is violated.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Probability**\nThe desired measurement outcome is inconsistent with the initial state because it violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. It is physically impossible for a system with a definite total `L_z` eigenvalue of `-1ħ` to be found in a state that has a total `L_z` eigenvalue of `-2ħ`. Therefore, the probability of this measurement is exactly **0**.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly deduced this through the same line of reasoning, although many selected an incorrect letter for their final choice. Based on the physics, the probability is 0.

Any measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum will yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$ with 100% certainty.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Measurement and Desired Outcome\n\nA measurement is performed on the **individual** z-components of the angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of obtaining a specific outcome:\n*   The eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n*   The eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum\n\nThe central physical principle here is the addition of angular momentum. The z-component of the total angular momentum is the direct sum of the individual z-components. This gives us a fundamental relationship between the operators:\n$L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\nThis operator relationship imposes a strict **selection rule** on their corresponding quantum numbers:\n**$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n\nThis rule means that a coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number $m$ is a superposition of uncoupled states where the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) must equal $m$. Any combination of $m_1$ and $m_2$ that does not sum to $m$ is physically impossible to measure from that initial state.\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Desired Outcome is Possible\n\nLet's check if our specific outcome satisfies the selection rule.\n*   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **m = -1**.\n*   From the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = \\mathbf{-2}$.\n\nNow, we compare the two values. The selection rule requires that $m = m_1 + m_2$. In our case:\n$-1 \\neq -2$\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Probability\n\nSince the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it is a physically impossible event. The probability of a physically impossible event is zero.\n\nMore formally, the probability is given by the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$. This coefficient is only non-zero if $m = m_1 + m_2$. Because this condition is not met, the coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is exactly 0, and therefore the probability is 0.\n\nBased on the analysis, the joint probability is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State and its Properties**:\n    The system is given in a *coupled angular momentum state*, described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The critical piece of information here is the total magnetic quantum number, $m=-1$. This number corresponds to the eigenvalue of the operator for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum, $L_z$. This means the system is in an eigenstate of $L_z$ and any measurement of this total quantity will definitely yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Final State of the Desired Measurement**:\n    The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the individual z-components of angular momentum and getting a specific result for both electrons.\n    *   For the first electron, the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   For the second electron, the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired outcome corresponds to a final state in the *uncoupled basis*, described by the ket $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relevant Physical Principle (Conservation Law)**:\n    A fundamental law in the addition of angular momenta is that the total z-component is the sum of the individual z-components. The operator relationship is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This implies a strict conservation law, or \"selection rule\", for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    This rule dictates that a coupled state with total magnetic quantum number $m$ is a superposition of only those uncoupled states where the individual quantum numbers $m_1$ and $m_2$ sum to $m$. Any outcome violating this rule is impossible.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**:\n    We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state, using the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired final state, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    We compare the required total `m` from the initial state (`-1`) with the resultant `m` from the final state (`-2`). Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the desired outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n    It is physically impossible for a system with a total $m = -1$ to be measured and found in a state where the sum of its components is $m_1 + m_2 = -2$. The probability of a physically impossible event is 0.\n\n6.  **Final Answer Choice**:\n    The calculated probability is 0.

This is the most crucial piece of information for this problem. It signifies that the system is an eigenstate of the operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. Any measurement of the total $L_z$ on this system must yield this value.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Measurement and Desired Outcome:**\n    A joint measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum for each electron, represented by the operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The measured eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the first electron having a magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The measured eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the second electron having a magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state would have a total z-component quantum number of $m_{final} = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Law of Angular Momentum Conservation:**\n    A core principle in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of angular momentum is conserved. The total operator is the sum of the individual operators ($L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$), which leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    This rule means that for a system in a state with a total magnetic quantum number $m$, the sum of the measured individual quantum numbers ($m_1, m_2$) *must* equal $m$. Any outcome that violates this rule is physically impossible.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency and Calculate Probability:**\n    Let's check if the desired outcome is consistent with the initial state.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number is exactly $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    We compare the required total from the initial state ($m=-1$) with the total from the final state ($m_1+m_2=-2$). Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the desired outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that is forbidden by a conservation law has a probability of exactly 0.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nAll the candidate agents correctly identified the core reasoning. The probability of measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ from the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is 0 because it violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum ($m=m_1+m_2$).

This is the most critical piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator, and any measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum *must* yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Desired Measurement Outcome:**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific joint measurement outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of the first electron's $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of the second electron's $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state is described in the uncoupled basis as $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    The core physical principle that governs this problem is the addition of angular momentum. A fundamental selection rule arises from this principle: the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of its individual parts.\n    *   As an operator equation: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   This implies a strict rule for their quantum numbers: **$m = m_1 + m_2$**.\n    A coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number $m$ is a superposition of only those uncoupled states for which the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) equals $m$. Any outcome violating this rule has zero probability.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state, using the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The sum is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n    *   Comparing the initial state's required total with the final state's actual total: **$-1 \\neq -2$**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Probability:**\n    The selection rule is violated. This means the desired measurement outcome is physically impossible given the initial state. The system is known to have a total $L_z$ value of $-1\\hbar$, so it cannot be found in a state with a total $L_z$ value of $-2\\hbar$. Therefore, the probability of this event occurring is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points and Analysis of Candidate Answers\n*   **Universal Correct Reasoning**: All 15 candidate answers correctly identify and apply the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum ($m = m_1 + m_2$) as the decisive step.\n*   **Unanimous Conclusion**: Every candidate's reasoning leads to the correct physical conclusion that the probability is 0.\n*   **Final Answer Discrepancy**: The candidate answers differ in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). This appears to be a transcription error in mapping the numerical answer (0) to the corresponding option letter. Since the physical reasoning is sound and consistent across all answers, it should be trusted over the final letter choices.\n\nGiven the options A) 0, B) 1/2, C) 2/3, and D) 1, the calculated probability of 0 corresponds directly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires determining the probability of a specific measurement outcome on a coupled quantum system. The key to solving this lies in the rules for the addition of angular momentum.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State and its Properties:**\n    The system is in the coupled state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This notation tells us several things:\n    *   Each electron is in a p-orbital, so their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$.\n    *   The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n    *   Most importantly for this problem, the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum is **$m = -1$**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome (Final State):**\n    A joint measurement is performed on the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of obtaining:\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$, which corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$, which corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum (The Selection Rule):**\n    A fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the simple sum of the individual z-components. The operator relationship is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This implies a strict conservation rule for their corresponding quantum numbers, which acts as a selection rule:\n    **$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n    This rule means that the initial coupled state with total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only be composed of uncoupled states for which the sum of individual quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) is equal to $m$. Any measurement outcome that violates this rule is physically impossible.\n\n4.  **Check if the Desired Outcome is Possible:**\n    We must compare the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state with the sum required by the final measurement outcome.\n    *   From the initial state: $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired final state: the sum is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Probability:**\n    We check if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied:\n    Is $-1 = -2$? **No.**\n    The desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An initial state known to have a total $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$ cannot be measured and found in a final configuration whose components sum to an $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-2\\hbar$. The transition is forbidden. Therefore, the probability of observing this outcome is **0**.\n\nThis reasoning is correctly identified in all the provided candidate answers. The physical conclusion is unambiguous. Matching this result to the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 2/3\nC) 1/2\nD) 0\n\nThe calculated probability is 0, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe system is described in the *coupled basis* by the state ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. Let's break down what this means:\n*   **$l_1=1, l_2=1$**: This confirms that the two electrons are in p-orbitals, as the orbital angular momentum quantum number for a p-orbital is 1.\n*   **$l=2$**: This is the quantum number for the magnitude of the *total* orbital angular momentum of the two-electron system.\n*   **$m=-1$**: This is the magnetic quantum number for the *total* orbital angular momentum's projection onto the z-axis. This is the most critical piece of information for this problem. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. Any measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum on this state must yield $-1\\hbar$.\n\n### Step 2: Deconstruct the Desired Final State (The Measurement Outcome)\nThe problem asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome:\n*   The measurement of $L_{1z}$ for the first electron yields an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding the first electron in a state with individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n*   The measurement of $L_{2z}$ for the second electron yields an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding the second electron in a state with individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\nThis desired outcome corresponds to finding the system in the *uncoupled* state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law\nA core principle of adding angular momenta in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component. The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the direct sum of the individual operators:\n$L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\nThis relationship between the operators imposes a strict selection rule on their corresponding quantum numbers. For any possible measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1$ and $m_2$) must equal the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the initial state.\n**Selection Rule: $m = m_1 + m_2$**\n\nIf this condition is not met, the transition from the initial state to the final state is impossible.\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Desired Outcome is Possible\nLet's apply the selection rule to our specific case:\n*   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **$m = -1$**.\n*   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. Their sum is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\nNow, compare the initial requirement with the final outcome:\n$-1 \\neq -2$\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Probability\nSince $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the desired measurement outcome violates the law of conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. A system known to be in a state with a total z-component quantum number of $m=-1$ cannot be found in a state where the sum of its components is -2. Such an event is physically impossible.\n\nThe probability of a physically impossible event is 0.\n\nMore formally, the probability is the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient connecting the initial and final states: $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are, by definition, zero unless $m=m_1+m_2$. Therefore, the probability is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate solutions.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n*   **System:** A two-electron system.\n*   **Initial State:** The system is in a specific *coupled* angular momentum state, denoted as `|l₁, l₂, l, m⟩ = |1, 1, 2, -1⟩`. The important information from this notation is:\n    *   `l₁ = 1` and `l₂ = 1`: The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons.\n    *   `l = 2`: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the combined system.\n    *   `m = -1`: The magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum.\n*   **Measurement:** A joint measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of the angular momenta, `L₁z` and `L₂z`.\n*   **Desired Outcome:** We need to find the probability of getting an eigenvalue of `-ħ` for **both** `L₁z` and `L₂z`. An eigenvalue of `-ħ` corresponds to a magnetic quantum number of `-1`. Therefore, the desired final state has individual quantum numbers `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\n**2. Identification of the Core Physical Principle**\nAll candidate answers correctly identify that the solution relies on the principle of addition of angular momentum in quantum mechanics. The central tenet for this problem is the **conservation of the z-component of angular momentum**.\n\n*   The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum (`L_z`) is the simple sum of the individual operators: `L_z = L₁z + L₂z`.\n*   This relationship between the operators imposes a strict **selection rule** on their corresponding quantum numbers: `m = m₁ + m₂`.\n*   This rule means that a coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number `m` can only be formed from, or be measured to be in, uncoupled states where the sum `m₁ + m₂` equals `m`.\n\n**3. Application of the Principle and Key Analysis Points**\nLet's apply the selection rule, which is the most critical step:\n\n*   **Point 1: Identify the definite total 'm' from the initial state.** The initial state `|1, 1, 2, -1⟩` is an eigenstate of the total `L_z` operator. This means it has a definite, non-probabilistic total magnetic quantum number `m = -1`.\n*   **Point 2: Identify the total 'm' required for the final state.** The desired measurement outcome is `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`. The sum of these individual components is `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n*   **Point 3: Compare the initial and final total 'm'.** The initial state requires the sum of z-components to be `-1`, but the desired outcome has a sum of `-2`.\n*   **Point 4: Draw a conclusion based on the comparison.** Since `-1 ≠ -2`, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n**4. Determining the Probability**\nAn event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible. In quantum mechanics, the probability of a physically impossible event is exactly **0**.\n\nFormally, the probability is the squared magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `⟨l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂ | l, m⟩`. This coefficient is non-zero only if `m = m₁ + m₂`. Since this condition is violated, the coefficient `⟨1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1⟩` is zero, and thus the probability is also zero.\n\nAll provided candidate answers reach this same conclusion through their reasoning, even though several fail to map this correct result to the corresponding multiple-choice letter. Based on the physics, the answer is unambiguously 0.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a consensus of reasoning and a direct calculation.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State of the System**\n\n*   The system is composed of two electrons in p-orbitals, meaning their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n*   The system is described in the *coupled basis*, where the total angular momentum is specified. The state is given by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n*   The most important piece of information from the initial state is the magnetic quantum number for the *total* angular momentum, which is **m = -1**.\n*   This means the system is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. A measurement of the total $L_z$ on this system will always yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n**2. Understand the Measurement and the Desired Outcome**\n\n*   A joint measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum for each electron, namely $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n*   The question asks for the probability of obtaining the eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for **both** $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n*   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n*   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n*   Therefore, the desired final state is one where the system is found with $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\n**3. Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law**\n\n*   In the addition of angular momenta, the z-component is conserved. This is a fundamental law.\n*   The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n*   This physical law leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers: for any possible measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1$ and $m_2$) must equal the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the initial state.\n*   **The Selection Rule:** $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n**4. Check for Consistency**\n\n*   Let's check if the desired outcome is physically possible given the initial state and the conservation law.\n*   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be **m = -1**.\n*   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n*   The sum of these individual quantum numbers for the desired outcome is: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n**5. Conclusion on Probability**\n\n*   We compare the total quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) with the sum required by the final state ($m_1+m_2 = -2$).\n*   Since **-1 ≠ -2**, the desired outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n*   An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible.\n*   The probability of an impossible event is **0**.\n\n**Final Review:** All candidate agents, despite some confusion in mapping the result to a letter, correctly used this line of reasoning to conclude that the probability is 0. The physics is unambiguous. Based on the options provided (A) 0, (B) 1, (C) 1/2, (D) 2/3, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State and Its Properties**:\n    The system is composed of two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state given by the ket `|l₁, l₂, l, m⟩ = |1, 1, 2, -1⟩`. The most important property for this problem is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This value is definite, meaning the z-component of the *total* angular momentum of the system is precisely `-1ħ`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome**:\n    The question asks for the probability of jointly measuring the z-component of angular momentum for *each* electron and getting the eigenvalue `-ħ`.\n    *   For the first electron, `L₁z` eigenvalue `-ħ` corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number **m₁ = -1**.\n    *   For the second electron, `L₂z` eigenvalue `-ħ` corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number **m₂ = -1**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (Selection Rule)**:\n    In the quantum theory of angular momentum, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of its individual parts. This relationship holds for the operators (`L_z = L₁z + L₂z`) and consequently for their corresponding quantum numbers. This leads to a strict selection rule:\n    **m = m₁ + m₂**\n    This means that for a system in a state with a total magnetic quantum number `m`, any physically possible measurement of the individual components must yield `m₁` and `m₂` that sum to `m`.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**:\n    Let's check if the desired outcome is consistent with the initial state using the selection rule.\n    *   The initial state requires the sum of components to be `m = -1`.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome would have a sum of components of `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    We compare the required total from the initial state (`-1`) with the sum from the desired final state (`-2`).\n    Since **-1 ≠ -2**, the desired measurement outcome violates the law of conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible.\n\n6.  **Final Probability**:\n    The probability of a physically impossible event is exactly **0**. Formally, the initial state and the final state are eigenstates of the total angular momentum operator `L_z`, but with different eigenvalues (`-1ħ` and `-2ħ`, respectively). Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal, so the probability of transitioning from one to the other is zero.\n\nBased on the options provided in the question:\nA) 0\nB) 1\nC) 2/3\nD) 1/2\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on a synthesis of the provided candidate solutions.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State of the System**\nThe system is described by the ket vector $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This notation is for the *coupled basis*, where the individual angular momenta of the two electrons ($l_1=1$, $l_2=1$) are combined to form a total angular momentum for the system ($l=2$).\nThe most critical piece of information for this problem is the total magnetic quantum number, **$m = -1$**. This means the system is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n**2. Understand the Desired Final State (The Measurement Outcome)**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome:\n*   The eigenvalue for the first electron's z-component of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$, is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number of $m_1 = -1$.\n*   The eigenvalue for the second electron's z-component of angular momentum, $L_{2z}$, is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number of $m_2 = -1$.\n\nThis desired outcome would mean the system is found in a state that, in the *uncoupled basis*, has the individual quantum numbers $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n**3. Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (Selection Rule)**\nA core principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component is conserved. The total z-component is the sum of the individual z-components. This gives rise to a strict selection rule for the quantum numbers:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nThis rule means that a coupled state with total magnetic quantum number $m$ is a superposition of uncoupled states, but *only* those states for which the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1$ and $m_2$) sum up to $m$. Any combination of $(m_1, m_2)$ that does not sum to $m$ is not part of the initial state and cannot be measured.\n\n**4. Check if the Desired Outcome is Possible**\nLet's check if our desired measurement outcome satisfies this rule:\n*   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be **$m = -1$**.\n*   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\nNow, compare these two values. The conservation law requires $m = m_1 + m_2$. In our case, this means we must have:\n-1 = -2\nThis statement is false.\n\n**5. Determine the Probability**\nBecause the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it is a physically impossible event. An initial state with a total $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$ can never be measured to have a final total $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-2\\hbar$.\n\nThe probability of a physically impossible event is **0**.\n\n**Conclusion from Candidate Answers**\nAll 15 candidate answers present this exact line of reasoning and correctly conclude that the probability is 0.

This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number for the first electron, $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The measurement of $L_{2z}$ yields the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number for the second electron, $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum**: A fundamental principle of adding angular momenta in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component. The operator relationship $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ leads to a strict selection rule for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    This rule states that the total magnetic quantum number of a coupled state must equal the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers of its constituent uncoupled states. A transition or measurement that violates this rule is physically forbidden.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: We now check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state using the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Comparing the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) with the sum required by the final state ($-2$), we find that they are not equal:\n    $-1 \\neq -2$\n    The desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n6.  **Determine the Probability**: An event that is physically impossible because it violates a conservation law has a probability of 0. Formally, the probability is given by the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$.

Since this condition is not met, the coefficient is zero, and thus the probability is 0.\n\nBased on the provided options:\nA) 2/3\nB) 0\nC) 1/2\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is 0.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Initial State**\nThe system is in the coupled angular momentum state `|l_1, l_2, l, m⟩ = |1, 1, 2, -1⟩`. This notation describes the combined state of two particles.\n*   `l_1=1` and `l_2=1` are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons (p-orbitals).\n*   `l=2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   `m=-1` is the total magnetic quantum number. This is the most crucial piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the operator for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum, `L_z`, with a definite eigenvalue of `mħ = -1ħ`.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Measurement and the Desired Outcome**\nA measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum for each electron, `L_{1z}` and `L_{2z}`. The question asks for the probability of a specific outcome:\n*   The eigenvalue for `L_{1z}` is `−ħ`. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number `m₁ = -1`.\n*   The eigenvalue for `L_{2z}` is `−ħ`. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number `m₂ = -1`.\nThis desired final state is described in the uncoupled basis as `|m₁, m₂⟩ = |-1, -1⟩`.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum**\nThis is the core physical principle that resolves the question. The total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. The operator relationship `L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}` implies a strict conservation rule for their corresponding quantum numbers, which acts as a selection rule:\n`m = m₁ + m₂`\n\nThis means that a coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number `m` can only be measured to be in an uncoupled state where the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers `(m₁ + m₂)` is equal to `m`.\n\n**Step 4: Check if the Desired Outcome is Physically Possible**\nWe must compare the total `m` of the initial state with the sum required by the final state.\n*   From the initial state `|1, 1, 2, -1⟩`, the total magnetic quantum number is **m = -1**.\n*   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is **m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2**.\n\nSince `-1 ≠ -2`, the selection rule is violated.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Probability**\nThe desired measurement outcome is inconsistent with the initial state because it violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. It is physically impossible for a system with a definite total `L_z` eigenvalue of `-1ħ` to be found in a state that has a total `L_z` eigenvalue of `-2ħ`. Therefore, the probability of this measurement is exactly **0**.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly deduced this through the same line of reasoning, although many selected an incorrect letter for their final choice. Based on the physics, the probability is 0. Matching this to the given options:\n\nA) 0\nB) 2/3\nC) 1\nD) 1/2\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a detailed, step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Initial State\n\nThe system of two electrons is described in the coupled basis by the ket:\n$|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n\nFrom this notation, we can extract the following crucial information:\n*   The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n*   The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l = 2$.\n*   The z-component of the **total** orbital angular momentum has the quantum number **m = -1**.\n\nThis means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator, where $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. Any measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum will yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$ with 100% certainty.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Measurement and Desired Outcome\n\nA measurement is performed on the **individual** z-components of the angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of obtaining a specific outcome:\n*   The eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n*   The eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum\n\nThe central physical principle here is the addition of angular momentum. The z-component of the total angular momentum is the direct sum of the individual z-components. This gives us a fundamental relationship between the operators:\n$L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\nThis operator relationship imposes a strict **selection rule** on their corresponding quantum numbers:\n**$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n\nThis rule means that a coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number $m$ is a superposition of uncoupled states where the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) must equal $m$. Any combination of $m_1$ and $m_2$ that does not sum to $m$ is physically impossible to measure from that initial state.\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Desired Outcome is Possible\n\nLet's check if our specific outcome satisfies the selection rule.\n*   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **m = -1**.\n*   From the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = \\mathbf{-2}$.\n\nNow, we compare the two values. The selection rule requires that $m = m_1 + m_2$. In our case:\n$-1 \\neq -2$\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Probability\n\nSince the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it is a physically impossible event. The probability of a physically impossible event is zero.\n\nMore formally, the probability is given by the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$. This coefficient is only non-zero if $m = m_1 + m_2$. Because this condition is not met, the coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is exactly 0, and therefore the probability is 0.\n\nBased on the analysis, the joint probability is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State and its Properties**:\n    The system is given in a *coupled angular momentum state*, described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The critical piece of information here is the total magnetic quantum number, $m=-1$. This number corresponds to the eigenvalue of the operator for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum, $L_z$. This means the system is in an eigenstate of $L_z$ and any measurement of this total quantity will definitely yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Final State of the Desired Measurement**:\n    The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the individual z-components of angular momentum and getting a specific result for both electrons.\n    *   For the first electron, the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   For the second electron, the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired outcome corresponds to a final state in the *uncoupled basis*, described by the ket $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relevant Physical Principle (Conservation Law)**:\n    A fundamental law in the addition of angular momenta is that the total z-component is the sum of the individual z-components. The operator relationship is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This implies a strict conservation law, or \"selection rule\", for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    This rule dictates that a coupled state with total magnetic quantum number $m$ is a superposition of only those uncoupled states where the individual quantum numbers $m_1$ and $m_2$ sum to $m$. Any outcome violating this rule is impossible.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**:\n    We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state, using the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired final state, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    We compare the required total `m` from the initial state (`-1`) with the resultant `m` from the final state (`-2`). Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the desired outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n    It is physically impossible for a system with a total $m = -1$ to be measured and found in a state where the sum of its components is $m_1 + m_2 = -2$. The probability of a physically impossible event is 0.\n\n6.  **Final Answer Choice**:\n    The calculated probability is 0.

This is the most crucial piece of information for this problem. It signifies that the system is an eigenstate of the operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. Any measurement of the total $L_z$ on this system must yield this value.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Measurement and Desired Outcome:**\n    A joint measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum for each electron, represented by the operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The measured eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the first electron having a magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The measured eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the second electron having a magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state would have a total z-component quantum number of $m_{final} = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Law of Angular Momentum Conservation:**\n    A core principle in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of angular momentum is conserved. The total operator is the sum of the individual operators ($L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$), which leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    This rule means that for a system in a state with a total magnetic quantum number $m$, the sum of the measured individual quantum numbers ($m_1, m_2$) *must* equal $m$. Any outcome that violates this rule is physically impossible.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency and Calculate Probability:**\n    Let's check if the desired outcome is consistent with the initial state.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number is exactly $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    We compare the required total from the initial state ($m=-1$) with the total from the final state ($m_1+m_2=-2$). Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the desired outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that is forbidden by a conservation law has a probability of exactly 0.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nAll the candidate agents correctly identified the core reasoning. The probability of measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ from the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is 0 because it violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum ($m=m_1+m_2$).

This is a critical piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. Any measurement of the total z-component must yield this value.\n\n2.  **Understand the Desired Measurement Outcome:**\n    The problem asks for the joint probability of a specific measurement on the *individual* electrons:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is measured to be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the first electron being in a state with an individual magnetic quantum number `m₁ = -1`.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is measured to be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the second electron being in a state with an individual magnetic quantum number `m₂ = -1`.\n    This potential final state is described in the *uncoupled basis*.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Law of Angular Momentum Addition:**\n    A cornerstone of quantum mechanics is the way angular momenta add. The z-component of the total angular momentum is the direct sum of the individual z-components. As operators, this is written as:\n    $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n    This operator relationship implies a strict selection rule for their corresponding quantum numbers. For a coupled state to be composed of uncoupled states, the quantum numbers must satisfy:\n    `m = m₁ + m₂`\n\n4.  **Check if the Desired Outcome is Physically Possible:**\n    We must now check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state based on this conservation law.\n    *   From the initial state `|1, 1, 2, -1>`, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **`m = -1`**.\n    *   From the desired final state, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n    *   Let's calculate the sum for the desired final state: `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Probability:**\n    We compare the required sum for the final state (`-2`) with the definite value from the initial state (`-1`).\n    Since **-1 ≠ -2**, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n    An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible.
