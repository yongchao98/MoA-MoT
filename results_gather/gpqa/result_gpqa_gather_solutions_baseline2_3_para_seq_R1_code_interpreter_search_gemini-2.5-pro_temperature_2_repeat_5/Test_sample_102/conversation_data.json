An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n        2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n        3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n    *   **Requirement:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield,\" which implies that the reaction steps must be highly selective, avoiding the formation of significant amounts of isomeric byproducts.\n\n2.  **Analyze Substituent Directing Effects:**\n    The order of reactions is crucial and is governed by the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n    *   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating and an **ortho, para-director**.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **-NH₂ (Amino):** Strongly activating and an **ortho, para-director**. This group is key because the options include reagents for its formation (`Fe/HCl`) and its removal (`NaNO₂/HCl`, `H₃PO₂`), indicating its use as a temporary directing group.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Synthetic Constraints and Strategies:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction, used to add the acetyl group, fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those with a -NO₂ group) and on rings with an -NH₂ group (aniline). This severely restricts the order of steps.\n    *   **High-Yield Strategy:** A direct synthesis is difficult because the directors (-COCH₃, -Br, -NO₂) conflict and/or heavily deactivate the ring. For example, nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone (from acylating then brominating benzene) would lead to a mixture of isomers due to conflicting directing effects. The most effective strategy for such a complex molecule often involves introducing a powerful directing group (like -NH₂) to control subsequent substitutions and then removing it at the end.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Provided Options:**\n\n    *   **Option A)** `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...`\n        This fails at step (iii). A Friedel-Crafts acylation will not work on the strongly deactivated p-bromonitrobenzene ring formed in the first two steps. This is not a high-yield pathway.\n\n    *   **Option B)** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`\n        This sequence represents an elegant, high-yield strategy using a temporary directing group:\n        1.  **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to **aniline**. This introduces the powerful, activating *ortho,para*-directing -NH₂ group.\n        2.  **Step iii:** Aniline is acylated. While a direct Friedel-Crafts on aniline is problematic, this step is best interpreted as the synthesis of **p-aminoacetophenone** (e.g., via N-acylation followed by Fries Rearrangement).\n        3.  **Step iv (Bromination):** On p-aminoacetophenone, the directing effects of the powerful -NH₂ group (at C4) and the -COCH₃ group (at C1) are **reinforcing** (cooperative), both directing the incoming bromine to **position 3**. This step is highly selective.\n        4.  **Step v (Nitration):** On the resulting 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone, the directing effects of the -NH₂ group (at C4) and the -COCH₃ group (at C1) are again **reinforcing**, both directing the incoming nitro group to **position 5**. This step is also highly selective.\n        5.  **Steps vi & vii:** The temporary amino group at C4, having perfectly controlled the placement of the bromo and nitro groups, is removed via diazotization and deamination. This sequence is composed of highly selective steps, fulfilling the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\n    *   **Option C)** `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`\n        This pathway begins correctly by forming 3-bromoacetophenone. However, step (iii), nitration, involves conflicting directors (-COCH₃ is meta, -Br is ortho,para). This will produce a mixture of isomers, violating the \"high-yield\" principle from the outset. Although the rest of the synthesis is designed to eventually converge this mixture, a pathway that avoids such a low-selectivity step is superior.\n\n    *   **Option D)** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂ ...`\n        The first four steps of this sequence simply convert benzene back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop and is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption B outlines the most chemically sound and strategic pathway. It cleverly uses a temporary amino group to direct the bromo and nitro substituents into the correct positions through steps with reinforcing directing effects, which ensures high selectivity and overall yield.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** The molecule is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All substituents are *meta* to one another.\n*   **\"High-Yield\" Goal:** The question requires the most efficient route, which means the steps must be highly selective (regioselective) to avoid the formation of unwanted side-products.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order of the reactions is critical and depends on how each substituent directs incoming electrophiles.\n*   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Identify Critical Reaction Constraints**\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** The reaction used to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) fails on strongly deactivated rings, especially those with a nitro group. This is a crucial rule that invalidates many potential sequences.\n*   **Use of Temporary Directing Groups:** The options include reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), and deamination (`H₃PO₂`). This is a strong indicator that the intended strategy involves using a temporary amino group (-NH₂), which is a powerful ortho,para-director, to control the placement of other substituents before being removed.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Four Given Options**\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene back into benzene. This is a circular and unproductive pathway, so it is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence generates p-bromonitrobenzene and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation in step (iii). The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, causing this reaction to fail. This is not a viable high-yield route.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence forms aniline and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on it. This reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), poisoning the catalyst and deactivating the ring. While an advanced interpretation might consider a Fries rearrangement, as written, this step is problematic.\n\n*   **Option B: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence outlines a sophisticated and effective synthetic strategy:\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This adds a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** Acetophenone is brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii (First Nitration):** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone occurs. The directing effects are in conflict (-COCH₃ is meta, -Br is ortho,para), leading to a *mixture* of isomers (mainly 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone and 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone). This seems like a low-yield step, but the rest of the synthesis cleverly addresses this.\n    4.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The mixture of nitro compounds is reduced to a mixture of the corresponding amino compounds.\n    5.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the brilliant, convergent step. In *both* isomers from the mixture, the powerful activating amino group (-NH₂) and the acetyl group (-COCH₃) work together to direct the new nitro group to the **C5 position**. This step is highly regioselective and funnels the entire mixture towards the correct substitution pattern.\n    6.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its role as a powerful directing group, is removed via diazotization and deamination.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSequence B represents a masterful synthetic design. It overcomes the lack of selectivity in an early step by using a subsequent, highly selective step that forces multiple reaction pathways to converge on the same intermediate. This ensures a high overall yield from the starting material, making it the best option.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Target:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1, a bromo group (-Br) at position 3, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are in a *meta* relationship to each other.\n*   **Directing Effects:** The order of reactions is crucial and depends on the directing effects of the substituents.\n    *   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n### 2. Key Synthetic Constraints\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction (using CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ to add the acetyl group) fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group (-NO₂). It also fails on aniline (-NH₂) because the basic amine poisons the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n*   **\"High-Yield\" Synthesis:** This implies the chosen reaction sequence must be highly regioselective, avoiding the formation of significant amounts of side-product isomers wherever possible or using an advanced strategy to overcome a lack of selectivity. The presence of reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), and deamination (`H₃PO₂`) points towards a sophisticated strategy involving a temporary directing group.\n\n### 3. Evaluation of the Given Options\n\nLet's evaluate each option as it is listed in the question.\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts by making bromobenzene, then nitrating it (to give mostly p-bromonitrobenzene). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this highly deactivated ring. This reaction fails. This option is not a viable pathway.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts by making aniline (benzene -> nitrobenzene -> aniline). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with and deactivates the AlCl₃ catalyst. While a similar transformation can be achieved via a multi-step process like a Fries Rearrangement, the sequence as written with these reagents is flawed.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop that makes no progress toward the final product.\n\n*   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This option describes a complex but chemically sound and elegant synthesis.\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This introduces a meta-directing acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the bromine to position 3, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. This step has conflicting directors (-COCH₃ is meta, -Br is ortho,para), leading to a mixture of isomers (e.g., 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone and 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone).\n    4.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro groups on the mixture of isomers are reduced to amino groups, creating a mixture of amino-isomers. This introduces the powerful amino directing group.\n    5.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the crucial regioselective step. For all isomers in the mixture, the powerful ortho,para-directing amino group and the meta-directing acetyl group work cooperatively to direct the new nitro group to position 5. This step takes the mixture from step iii and converts all of it to precursors of the desired product, causing the pathways to converge.\n    6.  **Steps vi & vii (Diazotization & Deamination):** The temporary amino group, having served its purpose of controlling the final nitration step, is removed to give the final product.\n\nThis sequence represents a valid, high-yield strategy because it uses a convergent synthesis approach to resolve the lack of selectivity in an intermediate step.\n\n### Conclusion\nOptions A, B, and C contain fundamentally flawed or nonsensical steps. Option D describes a valid and elegant synthetic route that, despite an intermediate non-selective step, is designed to be high-yield overall by cleverly using a temporary directing group and a convergent step.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Goal:** The synthesis must have a \"high yield,\" which implies that the reaction steps should be highly regioselective, avoiding the creation of significant amounts of unwanted isomers.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects and Reaction Constraints**\nTo plan the order of reactions, we must consider the directing effects of each substituent in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating, **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n\nThere is a critical constraint for one of the reactions:\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction, used to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`), fails on strongly deactivated rings, especially those with a nitro group (-NO₂). It also fails when a basic amino group (-NH₂) is on the ring because the amine poisons the Lewis acid catalyst.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option from the Prompt**\n\nWe will evaluate each of the provided multi-step sequences.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    *   This sequence first creates p-bromonitrobenzene (the major product of steps i and ii).\n    *   Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. Because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, this reaction will fail or give extremely low yields.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is not a viable high-yield pathway.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...`**\n    *   The first four steps of this sequence (nitration → reduction → diazotization → deamination) convert benzene into nitrobenzene, then aniline, then a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a nonsensical loop that does not lead to the product.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    *   This sequence creates aniline (from steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on it in step (iii).\n    *   As noted in the constraints, this reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pathway is incorrect as written.\n\n*   **Option A: `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`**\n    *   This is a complex but synthetically valid sequence. Let's trace it:\n        1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene → **Acetophenone**. The acetyl group is a meta-director. This is a valid start.\n        2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** Acetophenone → **3-Bromoacetophenone**. The meta-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine.\n        3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** Now, 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. The acetyl group (meta-director) directs to C5, while the bromo group (ortho,para-director) directs to C2, C4, and C6. The directors are in conflict, producing a **mixture of isomers**.\n        4.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro group on the isomer(s) is reduced to an amino group. For example, a major isomer from the previous step, 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone, becomes **4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone**. The nitro group here serves as a precursor to a temporary directing group.\n        5.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the brilliant regioselective step. On the intermediate (4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone), the powerful activating amino group at C4 directs the new nitro group to its ortho position (C5). The acetyl group at C1 also directs to C5 (its meta position). The directing effects **reinforce**, leading to a high yield of **4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone**. The difficult 1,3,5 pattern is now established.\n        6.  **Steps vi & vii (Diazotization & Deamination):** The temporary amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium salt (`-N₂⁺`) and then removed, replaced by a hydrogen atom using H₃PO₂.\n\nThis entire sequence is a classic example of an elegant \"convergent\" synthesis. It cleverly takes the mixture produced in a non-selective step (iii) and uses a subsequent highly selective step (v) to channel the main intermediates toward the same desired product. This strategy allows for a high overall yield.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the only sequence that represents a chemically sound, high-yield synthesis for the target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Target Molecule:**\n    *   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n        *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1\n        *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3\n        *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5\n    *   **Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All groups are *meta* to one another.\n\n2.  **Analyze Substituent Directing Effects:**\n    The success of the synthesis depends on the order of reactions, which is dictated by the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n    *   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Key Synthetic Constraints:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Reaction Limitations:** Friedel-Crafts acylation (adding the -COCH₃ group) is a crucial reaction that fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group (-NO₂). It also fails on aniline (-NH₂) because the basic amine poisons the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n    *   **\"High-Yield\" Requirement:** This implies that the chosen pathway must be highly regioselective, avoiding steps that create significant mixtures of isomers that would be difficult to separate and would lower the overall yield. The presence of reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), and deamination (`H₃PO₂`) suggests a complex strategy involving a temporary directing group (an -NH₂ group) to achieve this selectivity.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n\n    *   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n        This sequence attempts Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) on a bromonitrobenzene intermediate. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, causing the Friedel-Crafts reaction to fail. This is not a viable pathway.\n\n    *   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n        The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) serve only to convert benzene back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop that does not progress towards the target molecule.\n\n    *   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n        This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). As per the constraints, this reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst. While complex workarounds exist (e.g., Fries rearrangement), the reaction as written is fundamentally flawed and not a standard high-yield procedure.\n\n    *   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n        This sequence represents a sophisticated and valid strategy.\n        1.  **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone, and then the meta-directing acetyl group correctly positions the bromine at C3 to form 3-bromoacetophenone. These steps are standard and efficient.\n        2.  **Step iii (Nitration):** This step involves nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone. The directing effects are in conflict (-COCH₃ is meta, while -Br is ortho,para), leading to a mixture of isomers (e.g., 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone).\n        3.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro group on the isomers is reduced to an amino group (-NH₂), creating a mixture of amino-isomers. This amino group will now serve as a powerful temporary director.\n        4.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the key, elegant step. For the major isomer from the previous steps (4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone), the directing effects of the powerful activating amino group (at C4) and the acetyl group (at C1) are now **reinforcing** (cooperative). Both groups strongly direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. This step is therefore highly regioselective.\n        5.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The temporary amino group at C4, having fulfilled its role in directing the final substitution, is removed via diazotization and deamination.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption D outlines the only chemically sound and complete high-yield synthesis. Although it involves an intermediate step that is not selective (step iii), the subsequent steps form a clever convergent synthesis where the mixture is channeled into a single product through a highly selective, directed nitration (step v). The other options contain either nonsensical loops or reactions that fail under the specified conditions.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the best synthetic route.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule**\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   C1: -COCH₃ (acetyl group)\n    *   C3: -Br (bromo group)\n    *   C5: -NO₂ (nitro group)\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5 arrangement, meaning they are all *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects and Synthetic Constraints**\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   **-Br (bromo):** deactivating, *ortho,para*-director.\n    *   **-NO₂ (nitro):** strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Constraint:** The question asks for a \"high-yield\" synthesis. This means the synthetic pathway must be efficient and regioselective, avoiding steps that create low-yield mixtures of isomers.\n*   **Reaction Limitation:** Friedel-Crafts acylation (used to add the -COCH₃ group) fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a -NO₂ group. It also fails when the ring has an -NH₂ group, as the amine poisons the Lewis acid catalyst.\n*   **Advanced Strategy:** The presence of reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), and deamination (`H₃PO₂`) strongly indicates that an advanced strategy is being employed. This strategy involves using an amino group (-NH₂) as a powerful temporary director that is removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Reaction Sequences**\nLet's analyze the plausible sequences presented by the agents. The core debate is between two complex strategies.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Starts with Acylation** (`i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`)\n    *   **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to 3-bromoacetophenone. This is efficient and correct, as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Step iii (First Nitration):** This is a key step. The nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone involves conflicting directors (-COCH₃ is *meta*, while -Br is *ortho,para*). This leads to a mixture of isomers, not a high yield of a single product.\n    *   **Steps iv-vii (The \"Convergent\" Strategy):** This is where the synthesis becomes elegant. The mixture of nitro-isomers from step iii is not discarded. Instead, it is carried forward. The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (a temporary director). A second nitration is performed. In this step, the directing effects of the temporary amino group and the acetyl group work together to direct the new nitro group to the correct C5 position for *all* the isomers in the mixture. Finally, the temporary amino group is removed. This \"convergent\" approach turns an initially non-selective step into a high overall yield of the final product.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Starts with Nitration** (`i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`)\n    *   **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to aniline. This creates a powerful *ortho,para*-directing group to control the synthesis.\n    *   **Step iii (Acylation):** This step attempts Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails under standard conditions because the basic amine reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst. While this could be a shorthand for a multi-step Fries rearrangement, the sequence as written is fundamentally flawed at this step. If one were to assume this step works to produce p-aminoacetophenone, the subsequent steps (bromination and nitration) would be highly selective due to reinforcing directors.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nStrategy 2 is flawed because it relies on a non-standard reaction (Friedel-Crafts on aniline). Strategy 1, while containing a non-selective step, employs a well-known and powerful \"convergent synthesis\" strategy to resolve the resulting mixture, thus leading to a high overall yield. Therefore, Strategy 1 is the superior and more chemically sound pathway. Based on a consensus analysis of the provided answers, this pathway corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n**1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule and Goal**\n\n*   **Target:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Substituents & Pattern:** The benzene ring has three groups: an acetyl (-COCH₃), a bromo (-Br), and a nitro (-NO₂). They are in a 1,3,5-relationship, meaning they are all *meta* to each other.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -COCH₃: meta-director (deactivating)\n    *   -Br: ortho,para-director (deactivating)\n    *   -NO₂: meta-director (strongly deactivating)\n*   **Goal:** A \"high-yield\" synthesis. This requires carefully planning the reaction order to ensure high selectivity and avoid the formation of unwanted side-products (isomers).\n\n**2. Analyze the Key Synthetic Challenges**\n\n*   **Conflicting Directors:** A major challenge is that the target contains both meta-directors (-COCH₃, -NO₂) and an ortho,para-director (-Br). A simple, sequential addition of these groups will likely result in a mixture of isomers.\n*   **Reaction Constraints:** Friedel-Crafts acylation (adding the -COCH₃ group) does not work on strongly deactivated rings, such as one with a nitro group.\n*   **Use of a Temporary Directing Group:** The presence of reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), and deamination (`H₃PO₂`) in the options is a strong indicator that the intended strategy involves using an amino group (-NH₂) as a powerful directing group, which is then removed at the end of the synthesis. This is a common and powerful strategy for controlling substituent placement in complex molecules.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe must analyze each sequence for its chemical logic and its ability to achieve high selectivity.\n\n*   **Option C & D:** These options contain fundamentally flawed steps.\n    *   **Option C (`i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...`):** The first four steps convert benzene back into benzene. This is a pointless loop and incorrect.\n    *   **Option D (`i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...`):** Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a bromonitrobenzene ring. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, causing this reaction to fail or give extremely low yield. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **This leaves a choice between the two plausible, complex syntheses: Option A and Option B.**\n\n*   **Option B (`i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`):**\n    This sequence starts by correctly making 3-bromoacetophenone. However, step (iii) involves the nitration of this molecule. The ring has conflicting directors: a meta-director (-COCH₃) and an ortho,para-director (-Br). This will inevitably lead to a mixture of products, violating the \"high-yield\" requirement for a single intermediate. Although the subsequent steps cleverly use a \"convergent\" approach to turn this mixture into the final product, an ideal high-yield synthesis avoids creating such mixtures in the first place if possible.\n\n*   **Option A (`i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...`):**\n    This sequence represents the most elegant and selective strategy.\n    1.  **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to aniline. This introduces a powerful, activating, *ortho,para*-directing amino group (-NH₂).\n    2.  **Step iii:** An acetyl group is added. While a direct Friedel-Crafts reaction on aniline is problematic, this is standard shorthand for the process (N-acylation followed by Fries Rearrangement) that selectively produces *p*-aminoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iv (Bromination):** The substrate is now *p*-aminoacetophenone. The directing effects of the powerful -NH₂ group (at C4, *o,p*) and the -COCH₃ group (at C1, *m*) are **cooperative**, both directing the incoming bromine to position C3. This step is highly regioselective.\n    4.  **Step v (Nitration):** The directing effects of the -NH₂ group (at C4, *o,p*) and the -COCH₃ group (at C1, *m*) are once again **cooperative**, both directing the incoming nitro group to position C5. This step is also highly regioselective. (Note: in a lab, the amine would be protected as an amide before nitration, but the directing outcome is the same).\n    5.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The amino group at C4, having successfully controlled the placement of the other two groups, is now removed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption A describes a synthesis where every key substitution step is highly selective due to reinforcing (cooperative) directing effects. This is the definition of a superior, high-yield synthetic design. Option B is a valid, but less direct strategy because it relies on resolving a mixture formed from a non-selective step. Therefore, Option A is the best answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Target:** The molecule to be synthesized is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** It is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-arrangement. This means all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Key Challenge:** Creating this pattern in \"high yield\" is difficult because the substituents have conflicting directing effects. The acetyl and nitro groups are *meta*-directors, but the bromo group is an *ortho,para*-director.\n\n**2. Analyze Key Reaction Principles**\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** The reaction to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) does not work on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., rings with a `-NO₂` group). It also fails on aniline (a ring with an `-NH₂` group) because the basic amine poisons the Lewis acid catalyst.\n*   **High-Yield Strategy:** A direct, sequential substitution is unlikely to be high-yield due to the conflicting directors. The presence of `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO₂/HCl`, and `H₃PO₂` in the options strongly suggests the use of an advanced strategy: introducing a temporary amino group (`-NH₂`) to act as a powerful director, and then removing it at the end of the synthesis via diazotization and deamination.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on established chemical principles:\n\n*   **Option A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence fails at step (iii). After making p-bromonitrobenzene in the first two steps, the Friedel-Crafts acylation will not work because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This is not a viable pathway.\n\n*   **Option B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene back into benzene. This is a pointless loop and does not advance the synthesis toward the target. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence begins by correctly forming aniline (steps i and ii). However, step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline, which fails because the amine reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst. While this could be interpreted as a shorthand for a more complex process (Fries Rearrangement), as written, it represents a failed reaction. This makes the pathway ambiguous and less favorable.\n\n*   **Option C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This option describes a sophisticated and chemically sound \"convergent synthesis\" strategy.\n    1.  **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone, then to **3-bromoacetophenone**. These steps are selective and efficient.\n    2.  **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. Due to conflicting directors (`-COCH₃` is meta, `-Br` is ortho,para), this step is not selective and produces a **mixture of isomers**, mainly 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone and 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iv:** The mixture of nitro isomers is reduced to a mixture of the corresponding amino isomers.\n    4.  **Step v:** This is the key strategic step. The mixture of amino isomers is nitrated again. For both major isomers in the mixture, the powerful directing effects of the amino group and the acetyl group **work together (converge)** to direct the incoming nitro group to the same place: **position 5**.\n    5.  **Steps vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having served its crucial role in directing the final nitro group, is removed cleanly via diazotization and deamination.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis sequence is an elegant example of a high-yield synthesis. It cleverly takes the products from a non-selective step and funnels them all into a single, correctly substituted precursor. All the individual reactions are standard, and the overall strategy is powerful and effective. Therefore, it is the best choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n### Final Analysis and Decision\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Task:** The goal is to find the sequence of reactions that provides a \"high-yield\" synthesis of **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** starting from benzene. This means the chosen path should be chemically viable and highly regioselective, avoiding the formation of significant amounts of isomeric byproducts.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH₃) at C1, a bromo group (-Br) at C3, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C5.\n    *   **Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All groups are *meta* to each other.\n    *   **Directing Effects:** We have two *meta*-directors (-COCH₃, -NO₂) and one *ortho,para*-director (-Br). This mix makes a direct synthesis challenging.\n\n3.  **Key Reaction Constraints:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** The reaction to add the acetyl group fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., with a -NO₂) and on aniline (with an -NH₂) because the amine poisons the catalyst.\n    *   **High Yield Strategy:** The presence of reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), and deamination (`H₃PO₂`) strongly indicates the intended solution uses an amino group (-NH₂) as a temporary, powerful directing group to control the placement of substituents before being removed.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options Provided in the Prompt:**\n\n    *   **Option A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n        This sequence begins by taking benzene and, after four steps, converting it back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop and is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n        This sequence creates p-bromonitrobenzene and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. The reaction will fail or give extremely low yield because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **This leaves a comparison between the two complex routes, B and D.**\n\n    *   **Option B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n        This route begins by correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone. However, the crucial third step is the nitration of this molecule. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃) and an *ortho,para*-director (-Br) whose directing effects are in **conflict**. This step would produce a mixture of isomers and is therefore not a high-yield reaction for a single product, even if the subsequent steps cleverly converge the pathways.\n\n    *   **Option D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n        This sequence represents the superior synthetic strategy for achieving high yield:\n        1.  **Steps i-ii:** Benzene is converted to aniline. This installs a powerful activating, *ortho,para*-directing -NH₂ group to control subsequent steps.\n        2.  **Step iii:** Aniline is acylated. This step is best interpreted as a procedure (e.g., N-acylation followed by Fries rearrangement) to yield **p-aminoacetophenone**.\n        3.  **Step iv (Bromination):** On p-aminoacetophenone, the powerful *o,p*-directing amino group and the *m*-directing acetyl group have **reinforcing** effects, both directing the incoming bromine to position 3. This is a highly selective, high-yield step.\n        4.  **Step v (Nitration):** On the resulting 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone, the powerful *o,p*-directing amino group and the *m*-directing acetyl group once again have **reinforcing** effects, directing the incoming nitro group to position 5. This is another highly selective, high-yield step.\n        5.  **Steps vi-vii:** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its role in directing the other substituents with high precision, is cleanly removed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSequence D is superior because its key substitution steps (bromination and the final nitration) are highly regioselective due to the reinforcing directing effects of the substituents. This ensures a high yield of the correct isomer at each critical stage, which is the definition of a high-yield synthesis. Sequence B is flawed because it relies on an initial non-selective step with conflicting directors. Options A and C are fundamentally incorrect due to non-viable reactions or pointless steps.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\n*   **Target:** The final product is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** It is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, meaning all three groups are meta to each other.\n*   **Requirement:** The question specifies a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis, which means the pathway must be efficient and highly selective, avoiding the formation of significant amounts of unwanted isomers wherever possible.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects and Reaction Constraints**\nTo plan a high-yield synthesis, we must consider the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and other key reaction rules.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating, **ortho, para-director**.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **Key Constraint (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** The reaction to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group. It also fails when an amino group (-NH₂) is present on the ring because the basic amine reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe must analyze each proposed sequence for chemical viability and efficiency.\n\n*   **Option A: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...`**\n    The first four steps of this sequence—nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination—take benzene and convert it back into benzene. This is a futile and nonsensical loop. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    This sequence first forms aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline complexes with and deactivates the AlCl₃ catalyst. While there are multi-step workarounds (like the Fries rearrangement), this direct reaction as written is not viable. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    This sequence first creates 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (the major product). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. Because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, this reaction will fail or give an extremely low yield. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`**\n    This sequence represents a complex but elegant and high-yield strategy known as a **convergent synthesis using a temporary directing group**. Let's follow the steps:\n    1.  **i) Acylation:** Benzene is converted to **Acetophenone**. This introduces a meta-director.\n    2.  **ii) Bromination:** Acetophenone is brominated. The meta-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding **3-Bromoacetophenone**.\n    3.  **iii) Nitration:** This is a key step. The nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone is not highly selective because the directors conflict (-COCH₃ is meta, while -Br is ortho,para). This produces a mixture of isomers, with 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone being a major product.\n    4.  **iv) Reduction:** The nitro group on the isomer mixture is reduced to an amino (-NH₂) group. This converts the nitro group into a powerful ortho,para-directing group.\n    5.  **v) Second Nitration:** This is the brilliant, regioselective step. On the key intermediate (4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone), the powerful activating amino group at C4 and the meta-directing acetyl group at C1 **cooperate**, both directing the incoming nitro group to position **C5**. This forces the reaction to proceed with high selectivity to form the correct substitution pattern.\n    6.  **vi & vii) Diazotization and Deamination:** The temporary amino group, having served its purpose of directing the final nitro group, is cleanly removed from the ring.\n\nThis entire sequence successfully uses a non-selective step and then funnels the resulting mixture into a single, desired product in a subsequent, highly selective step. This is a hallmark of an effective, high-yield synthesis for a challenging target. It is the only chemically sound and logical option provided.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe task is to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, starting from benzene.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule**\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   C1: Acetyl group (`-COCH₃`)\n    *   C3: Bromo group (`-Br`)\n    *   C5: Nitro group (`-NO₂`)\n*   **Pattern:** The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All three groups are meta to each other.\n*   **Goal:** A \"high-yield\" synthesis. This requires high selectivity in the reaction steps to avoid forming significant amounts of unwanted isomers.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitutions is critical and is dictated by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring.\n*   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   `-Br` (Bromo): Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n*   `-NO₂` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Key Reaction Constraints**\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction, which adds the `-COCH₃` group, is subject to strict limitations. It fails on strongly deactivated rings, especially those containing a nitro group (`-NO₂`). It also fails when a basic amino group (`-NH₂`) is present because the amine poisons the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`).\n*   **Use of a Temporary Directing Group:** The presence of reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), and deamination (`H₃PO₂`) in the options is a strong indication that an advanced strategy is required. This strategy uses an amino group as a temporary, powerful ortho,para-director to control the placement of other groups, after which it is removed.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Option as Written**\n\nLet's analyze each reaction sequence for chemical viability and its ability to achieve a high yield.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n    This sequence begins with a four-step process (nitration → reduction → diazotization → deamination) that converts the starting material, benzene, back into benzene. This is a pointless loop and cannot be a correct synthetic pathway.\n\n*   **C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**\n    This sequence first generates p-bromonitrobenzene (the major product from steps i and ii). Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. Because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, this reaction will fail or give extremely low yields. This is not a viable high-yield pathway.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**\n    This sequence first creates aniline (the product of steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on it in step (iii). This reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with the `AlCl₃` catalyst, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation. This pathway is not viable as written.\n\n*   **A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence is complex but represents an elegant and chemically sound strategy.\n    1.  **Step i:** Acylation of benzene yields **acetophenone**. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n    2.  **Step ii:** Bromination of acetophenone yields **3-bromoacetophenone**, correctly placing the bromine at the meta position.\n    3.  **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. The directing effects are in conflict (meta vs. ortho,para), so this step produces a **mixture of isomers**, primarily 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone and 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone.\n    4.  **Step iv:** Reduction of the nitro groups in the mixture to amino groups. This creates a mixture of the corresponding amino-bromo-acetophenones.\n    5.  **Step v:** A second nitration. This is the crucial, regioselective step. For both isomers in the mixture, the powerful activating ortho,para-directing amino group and the meta-directing acetyl group **cooperatively direct** the new nitro group to **position 5**. This highly selective step causes the two separate reaction pathways to converge on intermediates that both lead to the final product.\n    6.  **Steps vi & vii:** Diazotization and deamination. The temporary amino group, having served its purpose, is cleanly removed.\n\nThis is a classic example of a **convergent synthesis**. It strategically uses a non-selective step and then funnels the resulting mixture of intermediates into a single product pathway, thus ensuring a high overall yield.

Analyze Substituent Directing Effects and Key Reaction Limitations**\n\n*   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **Critical Reaction Constraint:** Friedel-Crafts acylation (adding the -COCH₃ group) does not work on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group. The reaction also fails when performed on aniline (-NH₂) because the basic amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Reaction Sequence Option**\n\nWe will evaluate each option based on its chemical viability and its ability to achieve the desired 1,3,5 substitution pattern in high yield.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence first forms aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic nitrogen atom of the amino group coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring towards electrophilic attack. This pathway is fundamentally flawed as written.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂ ...**\n    The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) serve to convert benzene back into benzene. This is a pointless loop that accomplishes nothing towards the synthesis of the target molecule. This pathway is nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option C: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence begins by forming bromobenzene, followed by nitration to produce primarily p-bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. Because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, this reaction fails or provides extremely low yields. This is not a viable high-yield pathway.\n\n*   **Option D: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence represents a sophisticated and chemically sound strategy.\n    1.  **Step i:** Benzene is converted to **acetophenone** (acylation). The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Step ii:** Acetophenone is brominated, correctly placing the bromine at the *meta* position (C3) to give **3-bromoacetophenone**.\n    3.  **Step iii:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. At this stage, the ring has conflicting directors (-COCH₃ directs *meta* to C5, while -Br directs *ortho,para* to C2, C4, C6). This produces a mixture of isomers, which seems to contradict the \"high-yield\" requirement. However, this is part of a larger strategy.\n    4.  **Step iv:** The nitro group on the mixture of isomers is reduced to a temporary amino group. For instance, the major product from step iii (3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone) becomes **4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone**.\n    5.  **Step v:** This is the brilliant, regiocontrolled step. The ring is nitrated a second time. On the key intermediate, the powerful activating ortho,para-directing amino group at C4 and the meta-directing acetyl group at C1 work in concert to direct the new nitro group exclusively to **position 5**. This step is highly selective and funnels the intermediate product toward the desired substitution pattern.\n    6.  **Steps vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its role as a powerful director, is removed via diazotization and deamination.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOptions A, B, and C contain chemically flawed or nonsensical steps. Option D, while appearing complex and having a non-selective step, outlines a known, elegant synthetic strategy where the mixture from one step is resolved in a later, highly selective convergent step. This makes the overall synthesis, from start to finish, a high-yield process. Therefore, it is the only correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Requirements\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Substituents on Benzene Ring:**\n    1.  `-COCH₃` (acetyl group) at C1: A deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    2.  `-Br` (bromo group) at C3: A deactivating, *ortho,para*-director.\n    3.  `-NO₂` (nitro group) at C5: A strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** 1,3,5. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Key Requirement:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield,\" which implies that the reaction steps should be highly selective, avoiding the formation of significant amounts of isomeric side products.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Fundamental Reaction Constraints\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** The reaction to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group. It also fails on aniline (a ring with an -NH₂ group) because the basic amine reacts with and \"poisons\" the Lewis acid catalyst.\n*   **Complex Synthesis Strategy:** The inclusion of reagents like `Fe/HCl` (reduces -NO₂ to -NH₂), `NaNO₂/HCl` (converts -NH₂ to a diazonium salt, -N₂⁺), and `H₃PO₂` (removes the diazonium salt, replacing it with -H) is a strong indicator that the intended solution involves a sophisticated strategy using a temporary directing group.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Option\nWe will analyze the chemical validity and selectivity of each proposed sequence.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. Steps (i) through (iv) constitute a reaction sequence that transforms benzene into nitrobenzene, then aniline, then a diazonium salt, and finally back into benzene. This is a pointless loop that does not progress the synthesis.\n\n*   **Option C: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. It attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation in step (iii) on p-bromonitrobenzene (the major product from steps i and ii). The presence of the strongly deactivating nitro group on the ring will cause the Friedel-Crafts acylation to fail or proceed with extremely low yield.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**\n    This sequence presents a chemically superior pathway that relies on cooperative directing effects, although step (iii) is problematic as written.\n    *   **i & ii:** Benzene → Aniline. This introduces a powerful ortho,para-directing amino group.\n    *   **iii:** Acylation of aniline. Direct Friedel-Crafts acylation fails. However, in the context of these exam-style questions, this step is often interpreted as a successful transformation to p-aminoacetophenone (achievable via a multi-step process like a Fries rearrangement).\n    *   **iv & v:** In the subsequent bromination and nitration steps, the directing effects of the substituents would be *reinforcing* (cooperative), leading to highly selective reactions and high yields at each of these key steps.\n    *   **vi & vii:** The temporary amino group is removed.\n    While the chemistry of the later steps is excellent, the ambiguity and non-viability of step (iii) as a simple, one-pot reaction make this option problematic.\n\n*   **Option A: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence represents a brilliant and robust convergent synthesis.\n    1.  **i) Acylation:** Benzene → **Acetophenone**.\n    2.  **ii) Bromination:** The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the bromine to the correct C3 position, forming **3-Bromoacetophenone**.\n    3.  **iii) Nitration:** This step is key to the strategy. Nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone, which has conflicting directors, produces a **mixture of isomers** (e.g., 3-bromo-4-nitro- and 3-bromo-6-nitro-acetophenone). This initially seems like a low-yield step.\n    4.  **iv) Reduction:** The entire mixture of nitro isomers is reduced to the corresponding amino isomers. Nothing is discarded.\n    5.  **v) Second Nitration:** This is the elegant, yield-rescuing step. For each isomer in the mixture, the powerful *ortho,para*-directing amino group and the *meta*-directing acetyl group now **work together cooperatively**. They both direct the incoming nitro group to the **same position (C5)**.\n    6.  **vi & vii) Diazotization & Deamination:** The temporary amino group, having served its purpose, is removed.\n\n    This strategy is superior because it takes a non-selective step and, instead of treating the product mixture as a low-yield failure, it cleverly channels all the major components of that mixture toward the single desired final product. This results in a high *overall* yield for the entire synthesis.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nOption A describes the most sophisticated and chemically sound strategy for achieving a high overall yield. It employs a convergent synthesis that resolves an intermediate mixture, a hallmark of elegant and practical synthetic design.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the best answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthesis Goal\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern where all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Goal:** The question specifies a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis. This means the chosen reaction sequence must be highly regioselective, avoiding the formation of significant amounts of side-product isomers at each step.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Directing Effects and Key Reaction Constraints\n\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** A deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **-Br (bromo):** A deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-NO₂ (nitro):** A strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Reaction Constraints:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation** (using CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) is a key reaction for adding the acetyl group. However, it fails on strongly deactivated rings, particularly those with a nitro group (-NO₂). It also fails on aniline (a ring with an -NH₂ group) because the basic amine reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, poisoning it.\n*   **Advanced Strategy:** The inclusion of reagents like `Fe/HCl` (reduces -NO₂ to -NH₂), `NaNO₂/HCl` (converts -NH₂ to -N₂⁺), and `H₃PO₂` (removes the -N₂⁺ group) is a strong indicator that the intended solution involves using an amino group (-NH₂) as a powerful temporary directing group that is removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's evaluate the four provided reaction sequences based on these chemical principles.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...`**\n    This sequence first makes bromobenzene, then nitates it to give mainly p-bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. Because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, this reaction will fail or give extremely low yields. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl ; iv) H₃PO₂...`**\n    The first four steps of this sequence—nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination—result in the conversion of benzene back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop that does not advance the synthesis. **This option is incorrect.**\n\nThis leaves a decision between Option A and Option B, both of which represent complex, multi-step syntheses.\n\n*   **Option A: `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ...`**\n    This is a \"convergent\" synthesis strategy.\n    1.  It correctly creates 3-bromoacetophenone in the first two steps.\n    2.  However, step (iii), the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone, is not regioselective. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃) and an *ortho,para*-director (-Br) whose directing effects are in conflict. This will lead to a mixture of isomers.\n    3.  While the rest of the sequence cleverly funnels this mixture into the final product, starting with a non-selective step that produces a significant mixture is not ideal for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ...`**\n    This is a \"reinforcing directors\" strategy.\n    1.  **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to aniline, placing a powerful activating, *ortho,para*-directing -NH₂ group on the ring to control the synthesis.\n    2.  **Step iii:** Aniline is acylated. While a direct Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline fails, in the context of advanced synthesis problems, this is often an intended shorthand for a procedure like N-acylation followed by a Fries rearrangement, which selectively produces **p-aminoacetophenone**. This sets up the key intermediates.\n    3.  **Step iv (Bromination):** The directing effects of the powerful -NH₂ group (at C4) and the -COCH₃ group (at C1) are **reinforcing** (cooperative), both directing the incoming bromine to position C3. This step is highly regioselective and high-yield.\n    4.  **Step v (Nitration):** Again, the powerful -NH₂ group (at C4) and the -COCH₃ group (at C1) **reinforce** each other, both directing the incoming nitro group to position C5. This step is also highly selective and high-yield.\n    5.  **Steps vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having perfectly orchestrated the placement of the other substituents, is cleanly removed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the two plausible routes, **Option B describes a superior strategy for a high-yield synthesis.** Every key substitution step (iv and v) is highly regioselective because the directing effects of the substituents on the ring are cooperative, reinforcing each other. This ensures that the desired isomer is the overwhelmingly major product at each stage. In contrast, Option A relies on creating an isomeric mixture in a key step and then resolving it. The strategy in Option B, which maintains regiochemical control throughout, better fits the description of a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the best reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Target:** The goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** It is a benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1, a bromo group (-Br) at position 3, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three substituents are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Key Requirement:** The synthesis must be **\"high-yield\"**. This means the chosen sequence must be highly efficient and regioselective, avoiding the formation of significant amounts of unwanted isomers that would lower the yield.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order of reactions is crucial and is governed by the directing effects of the substituents in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):\n*   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho,para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Identify Major Synthetic Challenges and Constraints**\n\n*   **Conflicting Directors:** The final product has a mix of meta-directors (-COCH₃, -NO₂) and an ortho,para-director (-Br). A simple, direct sequence of substitutions will likely lead to conflicting directing effects, resulting in a mixture of isomers and thus a low yield.\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction, used to add the acetyl group, is subject to strict limitations. It fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group.\n*   **Use of a Temporary Directing Group:** The presence of the reagents `Fe/HCl` (reduces -NO₂ to -NH₂), `NaNO₂/HCl` (forms a diazonium salt from -NH₂), and `H₃PO₂` (removes the diazonium salt) in the options is a strong indicator that the intended high-yield synthesis involves using an amino group (-NH₂) as a powerful, temporary directing group that is removed at the end of the sequence.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on chemical viability and the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\n*   **B) `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...`**\n    This sequence creates p-bromonitrobenzene and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on it. The reaction in step (iii) will fail because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This is not a viable pathway.\n\n*   **C) `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...`**\n    The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop that achieves nothing towards the synthesis. This pathway is incorrect.\n\n*   **A) `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...`**\n    This is a complex convergent synthesis. Steps (i) and (ii) correctly form 3-bromoacetophenone. However, step (iii), the nitration, has conflicting directors (-COCH₃ is meta, -Br is ortho,para). This step produces a significant mixture of isomers. While the subsequent steps cleverly resolve this mixture to form the final product, starting with a non-selective step is generally not ideal for a \"high-yield\" synthesis if a more controlled route is available.\n\n*   **D) `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...`**\n    This sequence represents the most logical and regiocontrolled high-yield synthesis.\n    1.  **Steps (i) & (ii):** Benzene is converted to aniline, introducing a powerful activating, *ortho,para*-directing amino group to control the synthesis.\n    2.  **Step (iii):** This is interpreted as a process (like a Fries Rearrangement) to form p-aminoacetophenone. The powerful amino group directs the placement of the acetyl group.\n    3.  **Step (iv) Bromination:** The substrate is p-aminoacetophenone. The directing effects of the -NH₂ group (at C4, *o,p*) and the -COCH₃ group (at C1, *m*) are **reinforcing**, both directing the incoming bromine to position 3. This is a highly selective step.\n    4.  **Step (v) Nitration:** The substrate is 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone. The directing effects of the powerful -NH₂ group (at C4, *o,p*) and the -COCH₃ group (at C1, *m*) are again **reinforcing**, both directing the incoming nitro group to position 5. This is another highly selective step.\n    5.  **Steps (vi) & (vii) Deamination:** The temporary amino group at C4, having perfectly directed the placement of the bromo and nitro groups, is cleanly removed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSequence D is the superior pathway. Unlike the other options, it avoids non-viable reactions and futile loops. Crucially, compared to sequence A, it achieves higher overall yield by using a series of highly regioselective steps where the directing effects of substituents reinforce one another, thus minimizing the formation of unwanted side products. This is the hallmark of a well-designed, high-yield synthesis.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All groups are in a *meta* relationship to each other.\n*   **Key Requirement:** The question specifies a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis, which means the chosen pathway must be highly efficient and regioselective, avoiding steps that produce significant mixtures of isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects and Key Reaction Constraints\n*   **Directing Effects:** The order of reactions is dictated by the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n    *   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **Critical Constraints on Friedel-Crafts Acylation (FCA):** The reaction used to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) has two critical limitations relevant here:\n    1.  It fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group.\n    2.  It fails on aniline (a ring with an -NH₂ group) because the basic amine \"poisons\" the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on established chemical principles.\n\n*   **Option A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; v) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; vi) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; vii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**\n    This sequence is incorrect. The first four steps (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) serve only to convert benzene back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop and does not advance the synthesis.\n\n*   **Option B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence is incorrect. It attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation in step (iii) on p-bromonitrobenzene (the major product from the first two steps). The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, causing the FCA reaction to fail or proceed with extremely low yield.\n\n*   **Option D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence is incorrect. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). As stated in the constraints, this reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst. Although the subsequent steps are designed around reinforcing directing effects, the failure of step (iii) makes the entire pathway non-viable as written.\n\n*   **Option C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This option describes a sophisticated and chemically sound \"convergent synthesis\".\n    1.  **Step i & ii:** Benzene is first acylated to acetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group then correctly directs bromination to C3, efficiently forming **3-bromoacetophenone**.\n    2.  **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. This step is not highly selective because the directors are in conflict (-COCH₃ is meta, while -Br is ortho,para), leading to a **mixture of isomers**.\n    3.  **Step iv:** The entire mixture of nitro-isomers is then reduced, converting the nitro groups into amino (-NH₂) groups. This introduces a powerful temporary directing group.\n    4.  **Step v:** This is the elegant, yield-rescuing step. The mixture of amino-isomers is nitrated again. For the major isomers in the mixture, the directing effects of the powerful amino group (ortho,para) and the acetyl group (meta) now **cooperate (reinforce each other)**. Both direct the incoming nitro group to the same position, **C5**. This highly selective step causes the different pathways to converge, funneling the intermediates into the correctly substituted product.\n    5.  **Step vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its role, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination to yield the final product.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOptions A, B, and D contain either nonsensical steps or reactions that fail under the specified conditions. Option C, while involving a non-selective intermediate step, describes a classic and powerful synthetic strategy. By cleverly using a convergent step to resolve the isomeric mixture, it achieves a high overall yield from start to finish using only viable reactions.\n\n<<<C>>>"

A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n    *   **Requirement:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield,\" which implies that the reaction steps must be highly selective, avoiding the formation of significant amounts of isomeric byproducts.\n\n2.  **Analyze Substituent Directing Effects:**\n    The order of reactions is crucial and is governed by the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n    *   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating and an **ortho, para-director**.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **-NH₂ (Amino):** Strongly activating and an **ortho, para-director**. This group is key because the options include reagents for its formation (`Fe/HCl`) and its removal (`NaNO₂/HCl`, `H₃PO₂`), indicating its use as a temporary directing group.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Synthetic Constraints and Strategies:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction, used to add the acetyl group, fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those with a -NO₂ group) and on rings with an -NH₂ group (aniline). This severely restricts the order of steps.\n    *   **High-Yield Strategy:** A direct synthesis is difficult because the directors (-COCH₃, -Br, -NO₂) conflict and/or heavily deactivate the ring. For example, nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone (from acylating then brominating benzene) would lead to a mixture of isomers due to conflicting directing effects. The most effective strategy for such a complex molecule often involves introducing a powerful directing group (like -NH₂) to control subsequent substitutions and then removing it at the end.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Provided Options:**\n\n    *   **Option A)** `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...`\n        This fails at step (iii). A Friedel-Crafts acylation will not work on the strongly deactivated p-bromonitrobenzene ring formed in the first two steps. This is not a high-yield pathway.\n\n    *   **Option B)** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`\n        This sequence represents an elegant, high-yield strategy using a temporary directing group:\n        1.  **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to **aniline**. This introduces the powerful, activating *ortho,para*-directing -NH₂ group.\n        2.  **Step iii:** Aniline is acylated. While a direct Friedel-Crafts on aniline is problematic, this step is best interpreted as the synthesis of **p-aminoacetophenone** (e.g., via N-acylation followed by Fries Rearrangement).\n        3.  **Step iv (Bromination):** On p-aminoacetophenone, the directing effects of the powerful -NH₂ group (at C4) and the -COCH₃ group (at C1) are **reinforcing** (cooperative), both directing the incoming bromine to **position 3**. This step is highly selective.\n        4.  **Step v (Nitration):** On the resulting 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone, the directing effects of the -NH₂ group (at C4) and the -COCH₃ group (at C1) are again **reinforcing**, both directing the incoming nitro group to **position 5**. This step is also highly selective.\n        5.  **Steps vi & vii:** The temporary amino group at C4, having perfectly controlled the placement of the bromo and nitro groups, is removed via diazotization and deamination. This sequence is composed of highly selective steps, fulfilling the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\n    *   **Option C)** `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`\n        This pathway begins correctly by forming 3-bromoacetophenone. However, step (iii), nitration, involves conflicting directors (-COCH₃ is meta, -Br is ortho,para). This will produce a mixture of isomers, violating the \"high-yield\" principle from the outset. Although the rest of the synthesis is designed to eventually converge this mixture, a pathway that avoids such a low-selectivity step is superior.\n\n    *   **Option D)** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂ ...`\n        The first four steps of this sequence simply convert benzene back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop and is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption B outlines the most chemically sound and strategic pathway. It cleverly uses a temporary amino group to direct the bromo and nitro substituents into the correct positions through steps with reinforcing directing effects, which ensures high selectivity and overall yield.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** The molecule is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All substituents are *meta* to one another.\n*   **\"High-Yield\" Goal:** The question requires the most efficient route, which means the steps must be highly selective (regioselective) to avoid the formation of unwanted side-products.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order of the reactions is critical and depends on how each substituent directs incoming electrophiles.\n*   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Identify Critical Reaction Constraints**\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** The reaction used to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) fails on strongly deactivated rings, especially those with a nitro group. This is a crucial rule that invalidates many potential sequences.\n*   **Use of Temporary Directing Groups:** The options include reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), and deamination (`H₃PO₂`). This is a strong indicator that the intended strategy involves using a temporary amino group (-NH₂), which is a powerful ortho,para-director, to control the placement of other substituents before being removed.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Four Given Options**\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene back into benzene. This is a circular and unproductive pathway, so it is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence generates p-bromonitrobenzene and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation in step (iii). The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, causing this reaction to fail. This is not a viable high-yield route.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence forms aniline and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on it. This reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), poisoning the catalyst and deactivating the ring. While an advanced interpretation might consider a Fries rearrangement, as written, this step is problematic.\n\n*   **Option B: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence outlines a sophisticated and effective synthetic strategy:\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This adds a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** Acetophenone is brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii (First Nitration):** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone occurs. The directing effects are in conflict (-COCH₃ is meta, -Br is ortho,para), leading to a *mixture* of isomers (mainly 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone and 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone). This seems like a low-yield step, but the rest of the synthesis cleverly addresses this.\n    4.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The mixture of nitro compounds is reduced to a mixture of the corresponding amino compounds.\n    5.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the brilliant, convergent step. In *both* isomers from the mixture, the powerful activating amino group (-NH₂) and the acetyl group (-COCH₃) work together to direct the new nitro group to the **C5 position**. This step is highly regioselective and funnels the entire mixture towards the correct substitution pattern.\n    6.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its role as a powerful directing group, is removed via diazotization and deamination.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSequence B represents a masterful synthetic design. It overcomes the lack of selectivity in an early step by using a subsequent, highly selective step that forces multiple reaction pathways to converge on the same intermediate. This ensures a high overall yield from the starting material, making it the best option.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Target:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1, a bromo group (-Br) at position 3, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are in a *meta* relationship to each other.\n*   **Directing Effects:** The order of reactions is crucial and depends on the directing effects of the substituents.\n    *   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n### 2. Key Synthetic Constraints\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction (using CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ to add the acetyl group) fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group (-NO₂). It also fails on aniline (-NH₂) because the basic amine poisons the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n*   **\"High-Yield\" Synthesis:** This implies the chosen reaction sequence must be highly regioselective, avoiding the formation of significant amounts of side-product isomers wherever possible or using an advanced strategy to overcome a lack of selectivity. The presence of reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), and deamination (`H₃PO₂`) points towards a sophisticated strategy involving a temporary directing group.\n\n### 3. Evaluation of the Given Options\n\nLet's evaluate each option as it is listed in the question.\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts by making bromobenzene, then nitrating it (to give mostly p-bromonitrobenzene). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this highly deactivated ring. This reaction fails. This option is not a viable pathway.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts by making aniline (benzene -> nitrobenzene -> aniline). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with and deactivates the AlCl₃ catalyst. While a similar transformation can be achieved via a multi-step process like a Fries Rearrangement, the sequence as written with these reagents is flawed.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop that makes no progress toward the final product.\n\n*   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This option describes a complex but chemically sound and elegant synthesis.\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This introduces a meta-directing acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the bromine to position 3, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. This step has conflicting directors (-COCH₃ is meta, -Br is ortho,para), leading to a mixture of isomers (e.g., 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone and 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone).\n    4.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro groups on the mixture of isomers are reduced to amino groups, creating a mixture of amino-isomers. This introduces the powerful amino directing group.\n    5.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the crucial regioselective step. For all isomers in the mixture, the powerful ortho,para-directing amino group and the meta-directing acetyl group work cooperatively to direct the new nitro group to position 5. This step takes the mixture from step iii and converts all of it to precursors of the desired product, causing the pathways to converge.\n    6.  **Steps vi & vii (Diazotization & Deamination):** The temporary amino group, having served its purpose of controlling the final nitration step, is removed to give the final product.\n\nThis sequence represents a valid, high-yield strategy because it uses a convergent synthesis approach to resolve the lack of selectivity in an intermediate step.\n\n### Conclusion\nOptions A, B, and C contain fundamentally flawed or nonsensical steps. Option D describes a valid and elegant synthetic route that, despite an intermediate non-selective step, is designed to be high-yield overall by cleverly using a temporary directing group and a convergent step.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Goal:** The synthesis must have a \"high yield,\" which implies that the reaction steps should be highly regioselective, avoiding the creation of significant amounts of unwanted isomers.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects and Reaction Constraints**\nTo plan the order of reactions, we must consider the directing effects of each substituent in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating, **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n\nThere is a critical constraint for one of the reactions:\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction, used to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`), fails on strongly deactivated rings, especially those with a nitro group (-NO₂). It also fails when a basic amino group (-NH₂) is on the ring because the amine poisons the Lewis acid catalyst.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option from the Prompt**\n\nWe will evaluate each of the provided multi-step sequences.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    *   This sequence first creates p-bromonitrobenzene (the major product of steps i and ii).\n    *   Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. Because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, this reaction will fail or give extremely low yields.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is not a viable high-yield pathway.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...`**\n    *   The first four steps of this sequence (nitration → reduction → diazotization → deamination) convert benzene into nitrobenzene, then aniline, then a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a nonsensical loop that does not lead to the product.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    *   This sequence creates aniline (from steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on it in step (iii).\n    *   As noted in the constraints, this reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pathway is incorrect as written.\n\n*   **Option A: `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`**\n    *   This is a complex but synthetically valid sequence. Let's trace it:\n        1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene → **Acetophenone**. The acetyl group is a meta-director. This is a valid start.\n        2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** Acetophenone → **3-Bromoacetophenone**. The meta-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine.\n        3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** Now, 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. The acetyl group (meta-director) directs to C5, while the bromo group (ortho,para-director) directs to C2, C4, and C6. The directors are in conflict, producing a **mixture of isomers**.\n        4.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro group on the isomer(s) is reduced to an amino group. For example, a major isomer from the previous step, 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone, becomes **4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone**. The nitro group here serves as a precursor to a temporary directing group.\n        5.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the brilliant regioselective step. On the intermediate (4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone), the powerful activating amino group at C4 directs the new nitro group to its ortho position (C5). The acetyl group at C1 also directs to C5 (its meta position). The directing effects **reinforce**, leading to a high yield of **4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone**. The difficult 1,3,5 pattern is now established.\n        6.  **Steps vi & vii (Diazotization & Deamination):** The temporary amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium salt (`-N₂⁺`) and then removed, replaced by a hydrogen atom using H₃PO₂.\n\nThis entire sequence is a classic example of an elegant \"convergent\" synthesis. It cleverly takes the mixture produced in a non-selective step (iii) and uses a subsequent highly selective step (v) to channel the main intermediates toward the same desired product. This strategy allows for a high overall yield.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the only sequence that represents a chemically sound, high-yield synthesis for the target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Target Molecule:**\n    *   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n        *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1\n        *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3\n        *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5\n    *   **Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All groups are *meta* to one another.\n\n2.  **Analyze Substituent Directing Effects:**\n    The success of the synthesis depends on the order of reactions, which is dictated by the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n    *   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Key Synthetic Constraints:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Reaction Limitations:** Friedel-Crafts acylation (adding the -COCH₃ group) is a crucial reaction that fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group (-NO₂). It also fails on aniline (-NH₂) because the basic amine poisons the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n    *   **\"High-Yield\" Requirement:** This implies that the chosen pathway must be highly regioselective, avoiding steps that create significant mixtures of isomers that would be difficult to separate and would lower the overall yield. The presence of reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), and deamination (`H₃PO₂`) suggests a complex strategy involving a temporary directing group (an -NH₂ group) to achieve this selectivity.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n\n    *   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n        This sequence attempts Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) on a bromonitrobenzene intermediate. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, causing the Friedel-Crafts reaction to fail. This is not a viable pathway.\n\n    *   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n        The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) serve only to convert benzene back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop that does not progress towards the target molecule.\n\n    *   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n        This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). As per the constraints, this reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst. While complex workarounds exist (e.g., Fries rearrangement), the reaction as written is fundamentally flawed and not a standard high-yield procedure.\n\n    *   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n        This sequence represents a sophisticated and valid strategy.\n        1.  **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone, and then the meta-directing acetyl group correctly positions the bromine at C3 to form 3-bromoacetophenone. These steps are standard and efficient.\n        2.  **Step iii (Nitration):** This step involves nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone. The directing effects are in conflict (-COCH₃ is meta, while -Br is ortho,para), leading to a mixture of isomers (e.g., 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone).\n        3.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro group on the isomers is reduced to an amino group (-NH₂), creating a mixture of amino-isomers. This amino group will now serve as a powerful temporary director.\n        4.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the key, elegant step. For the major isomer from the previous steps (4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone), the directing effects of the powerful activating amino group (at C4) and the acetyl group (at C1) are now **reinforcing** (cooperative). Both groups strongly direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. This step is therefore highly regioselective.\n        5.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The temporary amino group at C4, having fulfilled its role in directing the final substitution, is removed via diazotization and deamination.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption D outlines the only chemically sound and complete high-yield synthesis. Although it involves an intermediate step that is not selective (step iii), the subsequent steps form a clever convergent synthesis where the mixture is channeled into a single product through a highly selective, directed nitration (step v). The other options contain either nonsensical loops or reactions that fail under the specified conditions.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the best synthetic route.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule**\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   C1: -COCH₃ (acetyl group)\n    *   C3: -Br (bromo group)\n    *   C5: -NO₂ (nitro group)\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5 arrangement, meaning they are all *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects and Synthetic Constraints**\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   **-Br (bromo):** deactivating, *ortho,para*-director.\n    *   **-NO₂ (nitro):** strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Constraint:** The question asks for a \"high-yield\" synthesis. This means the synthetic pathway must be efficient and regioselective, avoiding steps that create low-yield mixtures of isomers.\n*   **Reaction Limitation:** Friedel-Crafts acylation (used to add the -COCH₃ group) fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a -NO₂ group. It also fails when the ring has an -NH₂ group, as the amine poisons the Lewis acid catalyst.\n*   **Advanced Strategy:** The presence of reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), and deamination (`H₃PO₂`) strongly indicates that an advanced strategy is being employed. This strategy involves using an amino group (-NH₂) as a powerful temporary director that is removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Reaction Sequences**\nLet's analyze the plausible sequences presented by the agents. The core debate is between two complex strategies.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Starts with Acylation** (`i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`)\n    *   **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to 3-bromoacetophenone. This is efficient and correct, as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Step iii (First Nitration):** This is a key step. The nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone involves conflicting directors (-COCH₃ is *meta*, while -Br is *ortho,para*). This leads to a mixture of isomers, not a high yield of a single product.\n    *   **Steps iv-vii (The \"Convergent\" Strategy):** This is where the synthesis becomes elegant. The mixture of nitro-isomers from step iii is not discarded. Instead, it is carried forward. The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (a temporary director). A second nitration is performed. In this step, the directing effects of the temporary amino group and the acetyl group work together to direct the new nitro group to the correct C5 position for *all* the isomers in the mixture. Finally, the temporary amino group is removed. This \"convergent\" approach turns an initially non-selective step into a high overall yield of the final product.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Starts with Nitration** (`i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`)\n    *   **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to aniline. This creates a powerful *ortho,para*-directing group to control the synthesis.\n    *   **Step iii (Acylation):** This step attempts Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails under standard conditions because the basic amine reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst. While this could be a shorthand for a multi-step Fries rearrangement, the sequence as written is fundamentally flawed at this step. If one were to assume this step works to produce p-aminoacetophenone, the subsequent steps (bromination and nitration) would be highly selective due to reinforcing directors.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nStrategy 2 is flawed because it relies on a non-standard reaction (Friedel-Crafts on aniline). Strategy 1, while containing a non-selective step, employs a well-known and powerful \"convergent synthesis\" strategy to resolve the resulting mixture, thus leading to a high overall yield. Therefore, Strategy 1 is the superior and more chemically sound pathway. Based on a consensus analysis of the provided answers, this pathway corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n**1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule and Goal**\n\n*   **Target:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Substituents & Pattern:** The benzene ring has three groups: an acetyl (-COCH₃), a bromo (-Br), and a nitro (-NO₂). They are in a 1,3,5-relationship, meaning they are all *meta* to each other.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -COCH₃: meta-director (deactivating)\n    *   -Br: ortho,para-director (deactivating)\n    *   -NO₂: meta-director (strongly deactivating)\n*   **Goal:** A \"high-yield\" synthesis. This requires carefully planning the reaction order to ensure high selectivity and avoid the formation of unwanted side-products (isomers).\n\n**2. Analyze the Key Synthetic Challenges**\n\n*   **Conflicting Directors:** A major challenge is that the target contains both meta-directors (-COCH₃, -NO₂) and an ortho,para-director (-Br). A simple, sequential addition of these groups will likely result in a mixture of isomers.\n*   **Reaction Constraints:** Friedel-Crafts acylation (adding the -COCH₃ group) does not work on strongly deactivated rings, such as one with a nitro group.\n*   **Use of a Temporary Directing Group:** The presence of reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), and deamination (`H₃PO₂`) in the options is a strong indicator that the intended strategy involves using an amino group (-NH₂) as a powerful directing group, which is then removed at the end of the synthesis. This is a common and powerful strategy for controlling substituent placement in complex molecules.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe must analyze each sequence for its chemical logic and its ability to achieve high selectivity.\n\n*   **Option C & D:** These options contain fundamentally flawed steps.\n    *   **Option C (`i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...`):** The first four steps convert benzene back into benzene. This is a pointless loop and incorrect.\n    *   **Option D (`i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...`):** Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a bromonitrobenzene ring. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, causing this reaction to fail or give extremely low yield. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **This leaves a choice between the two plausible, complex syntheses: Option A and Option B.**\n\n*   **Option B (`i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`):**\n    This sequence starts by correctly making 3-bromoacetophenone. However, step (iii) involves the nitration of this molecule. The ring has conflicting directors: a meta-director (-COCH₃) and an ortho,para-director (-Br). This will inevitably lead to a mixture of products, violating the \"high-yield\" requirement for a single intermediate. Although the subsequent steps cleverly use a \"convergent\" approach to turn this mixture into the final product, an ideal high-yield synthesis avoids creating such mixtures in the first place if possible.\n\n*   **Option A (`i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...`):**\n    This sequence represents the most elegant and selective strategy.\n    1.  **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to aniline. This introduces a powerful, activating, *ortho,para*-directing amino group (-NH₂).\n    2.  **Step iii:** An acetyl group is added. While a direct Friedel-Crafts reaction on aniline is problematic, this is standard shorthand for the process (N-acylation followed by Fries Rearrangement) that selectively produces *p*-aminoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iv (Bromination):** The substrate is now *p*-aminoacetophenone. The directing effects of the powerful -NH₂ group (at C4, *o,p*) and the -COCH₃ group (at C1, *m*) are **cooperative**, both directing the incoming bromine to position C3. This step is highly regioselective.\n    4.  **Step v (Nitration):** The directing effects of the -NH₂ group (at C4, *o,p*) and the -COCH₃ group (at C1, *m*) are once again **cooperative**, both directing the incoming nitro group to position C5. This step is also highly regioselective. (Note: in a lab, the amine would be protected as an amide before nitration, but the directing outcome is the same).\n    5.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The amino group at C4, having successfully controlled the placement of the other two groups, is now removed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption A describes a synthesis where every key substitution step is highly selective due to reinforcing (cooperative) directing effects. This is the definition of a superior, high-yield synthetic design. Option B is a valid, but less direct strategy because it relies on resolving a mixture formed from a non-selective step. Therefore, Option A is the best answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Target:** The molecule to be synthesized is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** It is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-arrangement. This means all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Key Challenge:** Creating this pattern in \"high yield\" is difficult because the substituents have conflicting directing effects. The acetyl and nitro groups are *meta*-directors, but the bromo group is an *ortho,para*-director.\n\n**2. Analyze Key Reaction Principles**\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** The reaction to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) does not work on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., rings with a `-NO₂` group). It also fails on aniline (a ring with an `-NH₂` group) because the basic amine poisons the Lewis acid catalyst.\n*   **High-Yield Strategy:** A direct, sequential substitution is unlikely to be high-yield due to the conflicting directors. The presence of `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO₂/HCl`, and `H₃PO₂` in the options strongly suggests the use of an advanced strategy: introducing a temporary amino group (`-NH₂`) to act as a powerful director, and then removing it at the end of the synthesis via diazotization and deamination.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on established chemical principles:\n\n*   **Option A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence fails at step (iii). After making p-bromonitrobenzene in the first two steps, the Friedel-Crafts acylation will not work because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This is not a viable pathway.\n\n*   **Option B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene back into benzene. This is a pointless loop and does not advance the synthesis toward the target. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence begins by correctly forming aniline (steps i and ii). However, step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline, which fails because the amine reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst. While this could be interpreted as a shorthand for a more complex process (Fries Rearrangement), as written, it represents a failed reaction. This makes the pathway ambiguous and less favorable.\n\n*   **Option C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This option describes a sophisticated and chemically sound \"convergent synthesis\" strategy.\n    1.  **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone, then to **3-bromoacetophenone**. These steps are selective and efficient.\n    2.  **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. Due to conflicting directors (`-COCH₃` is meta, `-Br` is ortho,para), this step is not selective and produces a **mixture of isomers**, mainly 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone and 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iv:** The mixture of nitro isomers is reduced to a mixture of the corresponding amino isomers.\n    4.  **Step v:** This is the key strategic step. The mixture of amino isomers is nitrated again. For both major isomers in the mixture, the powerful directing effects of the amino group and the acetyl group **work together (converge)** to direct the incoming nitro group to the same place: **position 5**.\n    5.  **Steps vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having served its crucial role in directing the final nitro group, is removed cleanly via diazotization and deamination.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis sequence is an elegant example of a high-yield synthesis. It cleverly takes the products from a non-selective step and funnels them all into a single, correctly substituted precursor. All the individual reactions are standard, and the overall strategy is powerful and effective. Therefore, it is the best choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n### Final Analysis and Decision\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Task:** The goal is to find the sequence of reactions that provides a \"high-yield\" synthesis of **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** starting from benzene. This means the chosen path should be chemically viable and highly regioselective, avoiding the formation of significant amounts of isomeric byproducts.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH₃) at C1, a bromo group (-Br) at C3, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C5.\n    *   **Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All groups are *meta* to each other.\n    *   **Directing Effects:** We have two *meta*-directors (-COCH₃, -NO₂) and one *ortho,para*-director (-Br). This mix makes a direct synthesis challenging.\n\n3.  **Key Reaction Constraints:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** The reaction to add the acetyl group fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., with a -NO₂) and on aniline (with an -NH₂) because the amine poisons the catalyst.\n    *   **High Yield Strategy:** The presence of reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), and deamination (`H₃PO₂`) strongly indicates the intended solution uses an amino group (-NH₂) as a temporary, powerful directing group to control the placement of substituents before being removed.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options Provided in the Prompt:**\n\n    *   **Option A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n        This sequence begins by taking benzene and, after four steps, converting it back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop and is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n        This sequence creates p-bromonitrobenzene and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. The reaction will fail or give extremely low yield because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **This leaves a comparison between the two complex routes, B and D.**\n\n    *   **Option B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n        This route begins by correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone. However, the crucial third step is the nitration of this molecule. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃) and an *ortho,para*-director (-Br) whose directing effects are in **conflict**. This step would produce a mixture of isomers and is therefore not a high-yield reaction for a single product, even if the subsequent steps cleverly converge the pathways.\n\n    *   **Option D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n        This sequence represents the superior synthetic strategy for achieving high yield:\n        1.  **Steps i-ii:** Benzene is converted to aniline. This installs a powerful activating, *ortho,para*-directing -NH₂ group to control subsequent steps.\n        2.  **Step iii:** Aniline is acylated. This step is best interpreted as a procedure (e.g., N-acylation followed by Fries rearrangement) to yield **p-aminoacetophenone**.\n        3.  **Step iv (Bromination):** On p-aminoacetophenone, the powerful *o,p*-directing amino group and the *m*-directing acetyl group have **reinforcing** effects, both directing the incoming bromine to position 3. This is a highly selective, high-yield step.\n        4.  **Step v (Nitration):** On the resulting 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone, the powerful *o,p*-directing amino group and the *m*-directing acetyl group once again have **reinforcing** effects, directing the incoming nitro group to position 5. This is another highly selective, high-yield step.\n        5.  **Steps vi-vii:** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its role in directing the other substituents with high precision, is cleanly removed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSequence D is superior because its key substitution steps (bromination and the final nitration) are highly regioselective due to the reinforcing directing effects of the substituents. This ensures a high yield of the correct isomer at each critical stage, which is the definition of a high-yield synthesis. Sequence B is flawed because it relies on an initial non-selective step with conflicting directors. Options A and C are fundamentally incorrect due to non-viable reactions or pointless steps.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\n*   **Target:** The final product is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** It is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, meaning all three groups are meta to each other.\n*   **Requirement:** The question specifies a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis, which means the pathway must be efficient and highly selective, avoiding the formation of significant amounts of unwanted isomers wherever possible.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects and Reaction Constraints**\nTo plan a high-yield synthesis, we must consider the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and other key reaction rules.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating, **ortho, para-director**.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **Key Constraint (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** The reaction to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group. It also fails when an amino group (-NH₂) is present on the ring because the basic amine reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe must analyze each proposed sequence for chemical viability and efficiency.\n\n*   **Option A: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...`**\n    The first four steps of this sequence—nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination—take benzene and convert it back into benzene. This is a futile and nonsensical loop. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    This sequence first forms aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline complexes with and deactivates the AlCl₃ catalyst. While there are multi-step workarounds (like the Fries rearrangement), this direct reaction as written is not viable. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    This sequence first creates 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (the major product). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. Because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, this reaction will fail or give an extremely low yield. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`**\n    This sequence represents a complex but elegant and high-yield strategy known as a **convergent synthesis using a temporary directing group**. Let's follow the steps:\n    1.  **i) Acylation:** Benzene is converted to **Acetophenone**. This introduces a meta-director.\n    2.  **ii) Bromination:** Acetophenone is brominated. The meta-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding **3-Bromoacetophenone**.\n    3.  **iii) Nitration:** This is a key step. The nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone is not highly selective because the directors conflict (-COCH₃ is meta, while -Br is ortho,para). This produces a mixture of isomers, with 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone being a major product.\n    4.  **iv) Reduction:** The nitro group on the isomer mixture is reduced to an amino (-NH₂) group. This converts the nitro group into a powerful ortho,para-directing group.\n    5.  **v) Second Nitration:** This is the brilliant, regioselective step. On the key intermediate (4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone), the powerful activating amino group at C4 and the meta-directing acetyl group at C1 **cooperate**, both directing the incoming nitro group to position **C5**. This forces the reaction to proceed with high selectivity to form the correct substitution pattern.\n    6.  **vi & vii) Diazotization and Deamination:** The temporary amino group, having served its purpose of directing the final nitro group, is cleanly removed from the ring.\n\nThis entire sequence successfully uses a non-selective step and then funnels the resulting mixture into a single, desired product in a subsequent, highly selective step. This is a hallmark of an effective, high-yield synthesis for a challenging target. It is the only chemically sound and logical option provided.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe task is to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, starting from benzene.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule**\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   C1: Acetyl group (`-COCH₃`)\n    *   C3: Bromo group (`-Br`)\n    *   C5: Nitro group (`-NO₂`)\n*   **Pattern:** The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All three groups are meta to each other.\n*   **Goal:** A \"high-yield\" synthesis. This requires high selectivity in the reaction steps to avoid forming significant amounts of unwanted isomers.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitutions is critical and is dictated by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring.\n*   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   `-Br` (Bromo): Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n*   `-NO₂` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Key Reaction Constraints**\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction, which adds the `-COCH₃` group, is subject to strict limitations. It fails on strongly deactivated rings, especially those containing a nitro group (`-NO₂`). It also fails when a basic amino group (`-NH₂`) is present because the amine poisons the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`).\n*   **Use of a Temporary Directing Group:** The presence of reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), and deamination (`H₃PO₂`) in the options is a strong indication that an advanced strategy is required. This strategy uses an amino group as a temporary, powerful ortho,para-director to control the placement of other groups, after which it is removed.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Option as Written**\n\nLet's analyze each reaction sequence for chemical viability and its ability to achieve a high yield.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n    This sequence begins with a four-step process (nitration → reduction → diazotization → deamination) that converts the starting material, benzene, back into benzene. This is a pointless loop and cannot be a correct synthetic pathway.\n\n*   **C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**\n    This sequence first generates p-bromonitrobenzene (the major product from steps i and ii). Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. Because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, this reaction will fail or give extremely low yields. This is not a viable high-yield pathway.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**\n    This sequence first creates aniline (the product of steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on it in step (iii). This reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with the `AlCl₃` catalyst, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation. This pathway is not viable as written.\n\n*   **A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence is complex but represents an elegant and chemically sound strategy.\n    1.  **Step i:** Acylation of benzene yields **acetophenone**. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n    2.  **Step ii:** Bromination of acetophenone yields **3-bromoacetophenone**, correctly placing the bromine at the meta position.\n    3.  **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. The directing effects are in conflict (meta vs. ortho,para), so this step produces a **mixture of isomers**, primarily 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone and 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone.\n    4.  **Step iv:** Reduction of the nitro groups in the mixture to amino groups. This creates a mixture of the corresponding amino-bromo-acetophenones.\n    5.  **Step v:** A second nitration. This is the crucial, regioselective step. For both isomers in the mixture, the powerful activating ortho,para-directing amino group and the meta-directing acetyl group **cooperatively direct** the new nitro group to **position 5**. This highly selective step causes the two separate reaction pathways to converge on intermediates that both lead to the final product.\n    6.  **Steps vi & vii:** Diazotization and deamination. The temporary amino group, having served its purpose, is cleanly removed.\n\nThis is a classic example of a **convergent synthesis**. It strategically uses a non-selective step and then funnels the resulting mixture of intermediates into a single product pathway, thus ensuring a high overall yield. It is the only chemically viable and high-yield option presented.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1.

An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern.

The reaction also fails when performed on aniline (-NH₂) because the basic amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Reaction Sequence Option**\n\nWe will evaluate each option based on its chemical viability and its ability to achieve the desired 1,3,5 substitution pattern in high yield.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence first forms aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic nitrogen atom of the amino group coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring towards electrophilic attack. This pathway is fundamentally flawed as written.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂ ...**\n    The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) serve to convert benzene back into benzene. This is a pointless loop that accomplishes nothing towards the synthesis of the target molecule. This pathway is nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option C: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence begins by forming bromobenzene, followed by nitration to produce primarily p-bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. Because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, this reaction fails or provides extremely low yields. This is not a viable high-yield pathway.\n\n*   **Option D: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence represents a sophisticated and chemically sound strategy.\n    1.  **Step i:** Benzene is converted to **acetophenone** (acylation). The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Step ii:** Acetophenone is brominated, correctly placing the bromine at the *meta* position (C3) to give **3-bromoacetophenone**.\n    3.  **Step iii:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. At this stage, the ring has conflicting directors (-COCH₃ directs *meta* to C5, while -Br directs *ortho,para* to C2, C4, C6). This produces a mixture of isomers, which seems to contradict the \"high-yield\" requirement. However, this is part of a larger strategy.\n    4.  **Step iv:** The nitro group on the mixture of isomers is reduced to a temporary amino group. For instance, the major product from step iii (3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone) becomes **4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone**.\n    5.  **Step v:** This is the brilliant, regiocontrolled step. The ring is nitrated a second time. On the key intermediate, the powerful activating ortho,para-directing amino group at C4 and the meta-directing acetyl group at C1 work in concert to direct the new nitro group exclusively to **position 5**. This step is highly selective and funnels the intermediate product toward the desired substitution pattern.\n    6.  **Steps vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its role as a powerful director, is removed via diazotization and deamination.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOptions A, B, and C contain chemically flawed or nonsensical steps. Option D, while appearing complex and having a non-selective step, outlines a known, elegant synthetic strategy where the mixture from one step is resolved in a later, highly selective convergent step. This makes the overall synthesis, from start to finish, a high-yield process. Therefore, it is the only correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Requirements\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Substituents on Benzene Ring:**\n    1.  `-COCH₃` (acetyl group) at C1: A deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    2.  `-Br` (bromo group) at C3: A deactivating, *ortho,para*-director.\n    3.  `-NO₂` (nitro group) at C5: A strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** 1,3,5. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Key Requirement:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield,\" which implies that the reaction steps should be highly selective, avoiding the formation of significant amounts of isomeric side products.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Fundamental Reaction Constraints\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** The reaction to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group. It also fails on aniline (a ring with an -NH₂ group) because the basic amine reacts with and \"poisons\" the Lewis acid catalyst.\n*   **Complex Synthesis Strategy:** The inclusion of reagents like `Fe/HCl` (reduces -NO₂ to -NH₂), `NaNO₂/HCl` (converts -NH₂ to a diazonium salt, -N₂⁺), and `H₃PO₂` (removes the diazonium salt, replacing it with -H) is a strong indicator that the intended solution involves a sophisticated strategy using a temporary directing group.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Option\nWe will analyze the chemical validity and selectivity of each proposed sequence.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. Steps (i) through (iv) constitute a reaction sequence that transforms benzene into nitrobenzene, then aniline, then a diazonium salt, and finally back into benzene. This is a pointless loop that does not progress the synthesis.\n\n*   **Option C: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. It attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation in step (iii) on p-bromonitrobenzene (the major product from steps i and ii). The presence of the strongly deactivating nitro group on the ring will cause the Friedel-Crafts acylation to fail or proceed with extremely low yield.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**\n    This sequence presents a chemically superior pathway that relies on cooperative directing effects, although step (iii) is problematic as written.\n    *   **i & ii:** Benzene → Aniline. This introduces a powerful ortho,para-directing amino group.\n    *   **iii:** Acylation of aniline. Direct Friedel-Crafts acylation fails. However, in the context of these exam-style questions, this step is often interpreted as a successful transformation to p-aminoacetophenone (achievable via a multi-step process like a Fries rearrangement).\n    *   **iv & v:** In the subsequent bromination and nitration steps, the directing effects of the substituents would be *reinforcing* (cooperative), leading to highly selective reactions and high yields at each of these key steps.\n    *   **vi & vii:** The temporary amino group is removed.\n    While the chemistry of the later steps is excellent, the ambiguity and non-viability of step (iii) as a simple, one-pot reaction make this option problematic.\n\n*   **Option A: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence represents a brilliant and robust convergent synthesis.\n    1.  **i) Acylation:** Benzene → **Acetophenone**.\n    2.  **ii) Bromination:** The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the bromine to the correct C3 position, forming **3-Bromoacetophenone**.\n    3.  **iii) Nitration:** This step is key to the strategy. Nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone, which has conflicting directors, produces a **mixture of isomers** (e.g., 3-bromo-4-nitro- and 3-bromo-6-nitro-acetophenone). This initially seems like a low-yield step.\n    4.  **iv) Reduction:** The entire mixture of nitro isomers is reduced to the corresponding amino isomers. Nothing is discarded.\n    5.  **v) Second Nitration:** This is the elegant, yield-rescuing step. For each isomer in the mixture, the powerful *ortho,para*-directing amino group and the *meta*-directing acetyl group now **work together cooperatively**. They both direct the incoming nitro group to the **same position (C5)**.\n    6.  **vi & vii) Diazotization & Deamination:** The temporary amino group, having served its purpose, is removed.\n\n    This strategy is superior because it takes a non-selective step and, instead of treating the product mixture as a low-yield failure, it cleverly channels all the major components of that mixture toward the single desired final product. This results in a high *overall* yield for the entire synthesis.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nOption A describes the most sophisticated and chemically sound strategy for achieving a high overall yield. It employs a convergent synthesis that resolves an intermediate mixture, a hallmark of elegant and practical synthetic design.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the best answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthesis Goal\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern where all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Goal:** The question specifies a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis. This means the chosen reaction sequence must be highly regioselective, avoiding the formation of significant amounts of side-product isomers at each step.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Directing Effects and Key Reaction Constraints\n\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** A deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **-Br (bromo):** A deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-NO₂ (nitro):** A strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Reaction Constraints:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation** (using CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) is a key reaction for adding the acetyl group. However, it fails on strongly deactivated rings, particularly those with a nitro group (-NO₂). It also fails on aniline (a ring with an -NH₂ group) because the basic amine reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, poisoning it.\n*   **Advanced Strategy:** The inclusion of reagents like `Fe/HCl` (reduces -NO₂ to -NH₂), `NaNO₂/HCl` (converts -NH₂ to -N₂⁺), and `H₃PO₂` (removes the -N₂⁺ group) is a strong indicator that the intended solution involves using an amino group (-NH₂) as a powerful temporary directing group that is removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's evaluate the four provided reaction sequences based on these chemical principles.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...`**\n    This sequence first makes bromobenzene, then nitates it to give mainly p-bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. Because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, this reaction will fail or give extremely low yields. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl ; iv) H₃PO₂...`**\n    The first four steps of this sequence—nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination—result in the conversion of benzene back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop that does not advance the synthesis. **This option is incorrect.**\n\nThis leaves a decision between Option A and Option B, both of which represent complex, multi-step syntheses.\n\n*   **Option A: `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ...`**\n    This is a \"convergent\" synthesis strategy.\n    1.  It correctly creates 3-bromoacetophenone in the first two steps.\n    2.  However, step (iii), the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone, is not regioselective. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃) and an *ortho,para*-director (-Br) whose directing effects are in conflict. This will lead to a mixture of isomers.\n    3.  While the rest of the sequence cleverly funnels this mixture into the final product, starting with a non-selective step that produces a significant mixture is not ideal for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ...`**\n    This is a \"reinforcing directors\" strategy.\n    1.  **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to aniline, placing a powerful activating, *ortho,para*-directing -NH₂ group on the ring to control the synthesis.\n    2.  **Step iii:** Aniline is acylated. While a direct Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline fails, in the context of advanced synthesis problems, this is often an intended shorthand for a procedure like N-acylation followed by a Fries rearrangement, which selectively produces **p-aminoacetophenone**. This sets up the key intermediates.\n    3.  **Step iv (Bromination):** The directing effects of the powerful -NH₂ group (at C4) and the -COCH₃ group (at C1) are **reinforcing** (cooperative), both directing the incoming bromine to position C3. This step is highly regioselective and high-yield.\n    4.  **Step v (Nitration):** Again, the powerful -NH₂ group (at C4) and the -COCH₃ group (at C1) **reinforce** each other, both directing the incoming nitro group to position C5. This step is also highly selective and high-yield.\n    5.  **Steps vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having perfectly orchestrated the placement of the other substituents, is cleanly removed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the two plausible routes, **Option B describes a superior strategy for a high-yield synthesis.** Every key substitution step (iv and v) is highly regioselective because the directing effects of the substituents on the ring are cooperative, reinforcing each other. This ensures that the desired isomer is the overwhelmingly major product at each stage. In contrast, Option A relies on creating an isomeric mixture in a key step and then resolving it. The strategy in Option B, which maintains regiochemical control throughout, better fits the description of a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the best reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Target:** The goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** It is a benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1, a bromo group (-Br) at position 3, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three substituents are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Key Requirement:** The synthesis must be **\"high-yield\"**. This means the chosen sequence must be highly efficient and regioselective, avoiding the formation of significant amounts of unwanted isomers that would lower the yield.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order of reactions is crucial and is governed by the directing effects of the substituents in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):\n*   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho,para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Identify Major Synthetic Challenges and Constraints**\n\n*   **Conflicting Directors:** The final product has a mix of meta-directors (-COCH₃, -NO₂) and an ortho,para-director (-Br). A simple, direct sequence of substitutions will likely lead to conflicting directing effects, resulting in a mixture of isomers and thus a low yield.\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction, used to add the acetyl group, is subject to strict limitations. It fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group.\n*   **Use of a Temporary Directing Group:** The presence of the reagents `Fe/HCl` (reduces -NO₂ to -NH₂), `NaNO₂/HCl` (forms a diazonium salt from -NH₂), and `H₃PO₂` (removes the diazonium salt) in the options is a strong indicator that the intended high-yield synthesis involves using an amino group (-NH₂) as a powerful, temporary directing group that is removed at the end of the sequence.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on chemical viability and the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\n*   **B) `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...`**\n    This sequence creates p-bromonitrobenzene and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on it. The reaction in step (iii) will fail because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This is not a viable pathway.\n\n*   **C) `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...`**\n    The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop that achieves nothing towards the synthesis. This pathway is incorrect.\n\n*   **A) `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...`**\n    This is a complex convergent synthesis. Steps (i) and (ii) correctly form 3-bromoacetophenone. However, step (iii), the nitration, has conflicting directors (-COCH₃ is meta, -Br is ortho,para). This step produces a significant mixture of isomers. While the subsequent steps cleverly resolve this mixture to form the final product, starting with a non-selective step is generally not ideal for a \"high-yield\" synthesis if a more controlled route is available.\n\n*   **D) `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...`**\n    This sequence represents the most logical and regiocontrolled high-yield synthesis.\n    1.  **Steps (i) & (ii):** Benzene is converted to aniline, introducing a powerful activating, *ortho,para*-directing amino group to control the synthesis.\n    2.  **Step (iii):** This is interpreted as a process (like a Fries Rearrangement) to form p-aminoacetophenone. The powerful amino group directs the placement of the acetyl group.\n    3.  **Step (iv) Bromination:** The substrate is p-aminoacetophenone. The directing effects of the -NH₂ group (at C4, *o,p*) and the -COCH₃ group (at C1, *m*) are **reinforcing**, both directing the incoming bromine to position 3. This is a highly selective step.\n    4.  **Step (v) Nitration:** The substrate is 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone. The directing effects of the powerful -NH₂ group (at C4, *o,p*) and the -COCH₃ group (at C1, *m*) are again **reinforcing**, both directing the incoming nitro group to position 5. This is another highly selective step.\n    5.  **Steps (vi) & (vii) Deamination:** The temporary amino group at C4, having perfectly directed the placement of the bromo and nitro groups, is cleanly removed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSequence D is the superior pathway. Unlike the other options, it avoids non-viable reactions and futile loops. Crucially, compared to sequence A, it achieves higher overall yield by using a series of highly regioselective steps where the directing effects of substituents reinforce one another, thus minimizing the formation of unwanted side products. This is the hallmark of a well-designed, high-yield synthesis.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
