The mechanism is specified as two sequential electric dipole (E1) transitions, implying a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n    The process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\n    There is universal agreement among the candidate answers on the selection rules governing these transitions:\n    *   The change in orbital angular momentum quantum number: **Δl = ±1**.\n    *   The change in magnetic quantum number: **Δm = 0, ±1**.\n    *   For a spontaneous decay, energy must be released, so the principal quantum number **n must decrease** in each step.\n\n    A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because Δl = 0, which violates the selection rules. This confirms the necessity of the two-step process.\n\n3.  **Identify the Intermediate State**\n    All candidate answers correctly determine the properties of the intermediate state, $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, by applying the selection rules to both steps:\n    *   **First step: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   Initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy Δl=±1, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   Initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy Δm=0,±1, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$.\n    *   **Second step: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   This transition must end at $l=0$, which is consistent with the intermediate state having $l'=1$ (as Δl = -1).\n        *   The principal quantum number must again decrease, so $n' > 1$.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Combining the conditions on n ($1 < n' < 3$), the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Therefore, the only possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that all transition routes shown in the options are physically possible.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n    This is the crucial step that distinguishes the options. There is a strong consensus on the calculation method. The probability of a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   **Probability of Step 1: ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$)**\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an *s*-state ($l=0$) and is **spherically symmetric**. This is a critical point. Due to this symmetry, and in the absence of any external fields, the spontaneous decay is isotropic. This means there is no preferred direction for the emission, and consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three available magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability for any single specific channel is **1/3**.\n    *   **Probability of Step 2: ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$)**\n        Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only allowed E1 decay path to a lower energy level is to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Since this is the only available channel, this transition occurs with a probability of **1**.\n    *   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three complete cascade routes is the product:\n        $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### **Evaluation of the Options**\nBased on the unanimous and correct physical reasoning established above, any valid cascade route has a probability of 1/3. We can now evaluate the given choices:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The transition route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: The transition route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The transition route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The transition route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly pairs a physically allowed transition route with the correctly calculated probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers to determine the final, correct answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Physical Principles and Consensus**\n\nAll fifteen candidate answers, despite occasional variations in the lettering of the final choice, demonstrate a complete consensus on the underlying physics. The solution can be broken down into three core steps, on which all agents agree.\n\n**1. Verifying the Transition Path and Intermediate State**\n\n*   **Problem:** The transition is from the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$ via two electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n*   **Selection Rules:** The E1 selection rules govern this process:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n*   **Determining the Intermediate State:** Let the intermediate state be $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$.\n    *   **First step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$):** The initial state has $l=0$, so to satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l_{int}=1$. Since $n$ must decrease, $n_{int}$ must be less than 3.\n    *   **Second step ($|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):** The final state has $l=0$. To reach this from a state with $l_{int}=1$ is allowed ($\\Delta l = -1$). For this step to also be a decay, $n_{int}$ must be greater than 1.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Combining the conditions on $n_{int}$ ($1 < n_{int} < 3$), the intermediate state must have $n_{int}=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically valid intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes presented in the options are valid pathways.\n\n**2. Calculating the Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe \"probability\" refers to the branching ratio for a specific cascade. This is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$):**\n    This is the most critical part of the problem. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state ($l=0$) and is **spherically symmetric**. Due to this symmetry and the isotropic nature of spontaneous emission (in the absence of external fields), the atom has no preference for the orientation of the final state. This means the probability of transitioning to each of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m_{int}=-1, 0, 1$) is identical. Since these are the only three decay channels to the $n=2$ level, the total probability must be 1, meaning the probability for any single specific channel is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2 ($|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    Once the atom is in an intermediate $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ state, the only decay channel that satisfies the E1 selection rules and lowers its energy is the transition to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only path available, this transition happens with certainty. Its probability is **1**.\n\n*   **Overall Probability:**\n    The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{\\text{route}} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options**\n\nBased on the unanimous physical analysis, any valid decay route will have a probability of 1/3. We now compare this result to the options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly pairs a physically valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Process:** The question describes a quantum mechanical decay of a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Initial state:** `|n, l, m⟩ = |3, 0, 0⟩`. This is the 3s state.\n    *   **Final state:** `|n, l, m⟩ = |1, 0, 0⟩`. This is the 1s ground state.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The decay happens via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means it must pass through an intermediate state. The path is `|3,0,0⟩ → |intermediate state⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`.\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** The rules that govern which transitions are allowed are:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number `l` must be `Δl = ±1`.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number `m` must be `Δm = 0, ±1`.\n    *   For a spontaneous decay, the atom loses energy. In the simple Bohr model, energy depends only on the principal quantum number `n`, so `n` must decrease.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:** Let the intermediate state be `|n', l', m'⟩`. We apply the selection rules to both steps.\n    *   **First step: `|3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩`**:\n        *   The initial state has `l=0`. The `Δl = ±1` rule requires the intermediate state to have `l' = 1`.\n        *   The initial state has `m=0`. The `Δm = 0, ±1` rule allows the intermediate state to have `m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}`.\n        *   The energy must decrease, so `n' < 3`.\n\n    *   **Second step: `|n',l',m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`**:\n        *   The final state has `l=0`. A transition from the intermediate state with `l'=1` satisfies the selection rule (`Δl = 0 - 1 = -1`).\n        *   The energy must decrease, so the intermediate state's principal quantum number must be greater than the final state's, meaning `n' > 1`.\n\n    *   **Conclusion on the intermediate state:** Combining the conditions on `n'` from both steps (`1 < n' < 3`), the intermediate state must have `n'=2`. Therefore, there are three possible intermediate states: `|2,1,-1⟩`, `|2,1,0⟩`, and `|2,1,1⟩`. All routes presented in the options are physically valid paths.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route:** The question asks for the probability of one specific route. This is a branching ratio calculation. The total probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   **Probability of the first step:** The initial state `|3,0,0⟩` is an s-orbital (`l=0`), which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction for the atom. Therefore, the spontaneous decay is isotropic, and the transition probability is the same for each of the three possible final magnetic sublevels (`m'=-1, 0, 1`). Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first decay step, the probability of decaying to any **single** specific `m'` state is `1/3`.\n    *   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in an intermediate state `|2,1,m'⟩` (a 2p state), its only E1-allowed decay channel to a lower energy is the `|1,0,0⟩` ground state. Since this is the only path available, the transition occurs with a probability of 1.\n    *   **Total Probability:** The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n        P_total = P_step1 × P_step2 = (1/3) × 1 = `1/3`.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:** We need to find the option that shows a valid route and has the correct probability of `1/3`. Let's re-examine the options listed in the question:\n    *   A) `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩` and `1/4`: The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩` and `1/3`: The path is valid, and the probability is correct.\n    *   C) `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩` and `1/4`: The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) `⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩` and `2/3`: The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect (and there's a typo).\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct physical reasoning presented by all candidate answers, the only option that is consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the physical process and selection rules\nThe problem describes a two-step decay of a Hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. This means the decay proceeds through an intermediate state:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll the candidate answers correctly identify the E1 selection rules which govern these transitions:\n1.  **Orbital Angular Momentum:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$. This implies the parity of the state must change.\n2.  **Magnetic Quantum Number:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Principal Quantum Number:** For spontaneous decay, the energy must decrease. In the Hydrogen atom, this means the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0-0=0$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the properties of the intermediate state\nAll candidate answers correctly apply the selection rules to find the possible intermediate state(s), let's call it $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **For the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$, so the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ (to satisfy $\\Delta l=\\pm1$).\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$, so the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ (to satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm1$).\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **For the second transition ($|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The transition is from $l'=1$ to $l_{final}=0$, so $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $n' > 1$.\n\nCombining the constraints on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\nTherefore, there are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that all routes listed in the options are physically allowed paths.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the probability (branching ratio) of a specific route\nThis is the deciding factor. All candidate answers that provide reasoning arrive at the same conclusion for the probability calculation.\n\n1.  **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (a 2p level), the only lower-energy state it can decay to via an E1 transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available decay channel, the probability of this step happening is 1.\n\n2.  **Probability of the first step:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state ($l=0$) and is **spherically symmetric**. This is a crucial point. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space for the emitted photon. Therefore, the atom must decay into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) with equal probability.\nSince there are three equally likely outcomes, their probabilities must sum to 1. The probability of transitioning to any single specific sublevel is therefore **1/3**.\n\n3.  **Total probability:** The probability for any of the three complete cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the given options\nBased on the unanimous physical reasoning, any of the three valid decay routes has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. Now we evaluate the options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    The transition route is valid, and the calculated probability is correct.\n\n*   **B) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    The probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly pairs a valid physical process with its correctly calculated probability is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis using the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the rules for atomic transitions. All provided candidate answers arrive at the same physical conclusion, confirming the soundness of the following reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Transition and Identify the Governing Rules**\nThe question describes a decay from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 3s orbital of a hydrogen atom) to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s ground state). The process occurs via two consecutive **electric dipole (E1) transitions**.\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden. This is because the electric dipole selection rules require the orbital angular momentum quantum number, `l`, to change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$. In this case, the change would be $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$. This confirms the necessity of a two-step process through an intermediate state.\n\nThe E1 selection rules are:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number, `n`, must decrease, as the atom loses energy.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\nLet the cascade be represented as $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n', l', m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **For Step 1:** The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$. For a state to exist with $l'=1$, we must have $n' > l'$, so $n' \\ge 2$. The only integer satisfying these conditions is $n'=2$.\n    *   The initial magnetic quantum number is $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Conclusion for the intermediate state:** The decay must proceed through the $n=2, l=1$ (or 2p) level. The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All the decay routes listed in the options are physically plausible based on these selection rules.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability of the Transition Route**\nThe probability of a specific cascade path is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each individual step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2: ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$)**\n    Once the atom is in an intermediate 2p state, its only possible decay path via an E1 transition is to the 1s ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is the only state of lower energy that satisfies the selection rules. Since it is the *only* available decay channel, the probability of this step occurring is 1.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1: ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$)**\n    This is the most critical part of the analysis. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an `s`-state ($l=0$) and is therefore **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, spontaneous emission must be isotropic (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom cannot prefer to transition into one magnetic sublevel ($m'=-1, 0, \\text{or } 1$) over the others. The transition probabilities to each of these three states must be equal. Since these are the only three allowed outcomes for the first step, and their probabilities must sum to 1, the probability for transitioning to any **single specific** intermediate state is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single, complete route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{\\text{total}} = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\nWe now compare our calculated result with the options provided in the question. We are looking for an option that presents a valid route and a probability of 1/3.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$.

Analysis of the Physical Problem**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine a valid decay pathway and its associated probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n**2. Application of Selection Rules**\n\nAll the candidate answers correctly identify the E1 selection rules, which are the fundamental physical principles governing the transition:\n*   The change in orbital angular momentum must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For spontaneous emission (decay), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease, as the atom loses energy.\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (with $l=0$) to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (with $l=0$) is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0$. This confirms the necessity of a two-step process involving an intermediate state.\n\n**3. Determination of the Intermediate State and Possible Routes**\n\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. The analysis proceeds in two steps:\n*   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Since the initial state has $l=0$, the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ dictates that the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease ($n'<3$) but also must be large enough to accommodate an $l'=1$ state (requiring $n' \\ge 2$). The only integer value satisfying these conditions is $n'=2$.\n    *   Since the initial state has $m=0$, the rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n*   **Second transition:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   This transition from $l'=1$ to the final state's $l=0$ is allowed since $\\Delta l = -1$.\n    *   The change in magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$, is also allowed for all possible $m'$ values.\n\n**Conclusion on Routes:** The decay must proceed through one of the three `2p` sublevels: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$. Therefore, all routes listed in the options are physically valid paths. The deciding factor must be the probability.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThis is the most critical step and reveals a strong consensus among the candidate answers. The total probability of a specific cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1: ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$)**\n    *   **Key Insight:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an `s-state` ($l=0$) and is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   Because the initial state and the decay interaction are isotropic (in the absence of external fields), the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state.\n    *   Since there are three equally likely, exhaustive outcomes, the probability (branching ratio) of entering any *single* one of these states is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2: ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$)**\n    *   Once the atom is in a `2p` state, its only possible decay path to a lower energy level via an E1 transition is to the `1s` ground state.\n    *   Since this is the only available E1 decay channel, the probability of this step is **1**.\n\n*   **Overall Probability:**\n    *   The probability for any one of the three complete cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n        $P_{route} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**5. Final Evaluation**\n\nThe correct answer must describe a valid route and state its probability as $\\frac{1}{3}$. Let's examine the options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and $\\frac{2}{3}$\n    *   The probability is incorrect (and the state description is incomplete).\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   **The route is valid, and the probability is correct.**\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct physical reasoning presented by the candidate answers, the only choice that matches the calculated result is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn analysis of the problem and the provided candidate answers reveals a clear and unanimous conclusion based on the underlying principles of quantum mechanics. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### **1. Understand the Physical Process and Rules**\n\nThe problem asks for a valid pathway and the corresponding probability for a hydrogen atom decaying from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n\nThe key principles are the E1 selection rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Energy must decrease:** For spontaneous emission, the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease at each step.\n\n### **2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l=0$. Therefore, a two-step process is necessary:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{step 1}} |\\text{intermediate}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   **For Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$, so the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ (to satisfy $\\Delta l=\\pm 1$).\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$, so the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $n'<3$.\n*   **For Step 2 ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   This step is from $l'=1$ to $l_{final}=0$, so $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $n'>1$.\n\nCombining the constraints on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Thus, there are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, \\text{and } |2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that the transition routes presented in options A, B, and C are all physically possible.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step. This point is correctly identified by all candidate agents.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state ($l=0$) and is therefore **spherically symmetric**. Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space for the atom to decay. This means it has an equal probability of transitioning into any of the three available magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability for any single one is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** Once the atom is in an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, the only decay channel allowed by the E1 selection rules to a lower energy state is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Since this is the only possible decay route, it occurs with certainty. The probability for this step is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any single, specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{total} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nWe now compare this derived result—that any valid route has a probability of 1/3—with the options provided in the question.\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    This option presents a valid transition route and the correctly calculated probability. This is the correct answer.\n\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    The probability is incorrect (and the initial state is omitted due to a typo).\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct physical reasoning presented by the candidate answers, the only choice that matches the physics is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, based on a synthesis of the provided candidate responses.\n\n### 1. Identify the Physical Process and Rules\nThe question asks to identify a correct decay path and its associated probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\nThe governing principles are the **E1 selection rules**:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For spontaneous decay, energy must be released. In the hydrogen atom, this means the principal quantum number `n` must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determine the Intermediate State and Possible Routes\nThe process is a two-step cascade: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$. Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since the decay releases energy, $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   A transition from the intermediate state with $l'=1$ to the final state with $l=0$ results in $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Since this decay also releases energy, $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n\n*   **Combining Constraints:** The constraints on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$) mean the only possible value is $n'=2$.\n*   **Conclusion on Routes:** The intermediate state must be of the form $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ where $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. Therefore, there are three physically valid decay routes. All routes listed in the options A, B, C, and D are valid physical pathways.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe \"probability\" here refers to the branching ratio for a specific cascade path. The total probability is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):** This is the most important part of the calculation. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, making it an `s`-state. An `s`-state is **spherically symmetric**, meaning it has no preferred orientation in space. Due to this symmetry, the spontaneous decay is isotropic, and the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state. Since there are three equally probable outcomes that constitute all possibilities for this decay step, the probability of decaying into any *one specific* channel is **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2 ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):** Once the atom is in an intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state, its only allowed decay path via E1 transition is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available channel, this transition occurs with a probability of **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The overall probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Options and Conclude\nBased on the unanimous physical reasoning from all provided analyses, any of the three possible decay routes has a probability of 1/3. We now evaluate the specific options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. **The route is valid, and the probability is correct.**\n\nThe final correct choice is the one that combines a valid path with the calculated probability of 1/3.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers, there is an overwhelming consensus on the physical principles and calculations required to solve the problem. The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidates stem from different orderings of the multiple-choice options they were presented with. The following is a consolidated, step-by-step breakdown of the correct reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process and Rules:**\n    *   **Process**: The problem describes a two-step cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   **Mechanism**: Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition.\n    *   **Governing Rules**: The decay must adhere to the E1 selection rules:\n        *   Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n        *   Change in magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n        *   Change in principal quantum number for decay: $\\Delta n < 0$ (energy decreases).\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l=0$. The decay must proceed through an intermediate state, $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   The initial state has $l=0$, so the `Δl=±1` rule requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n        *   The initial state has $m=0$, so the `Δm=0,±1` rule allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   The energy must decrease, so $n'$ must be less than 3.\n    *   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   The final state has $l=0$, so the transition from an intermediate state with $l'=1$ satisfies the `Δl=±1` rule ($\\Delta l = -1$).\n        *   The energy must decrease, so the intermediate state must have $n'$ greater than 1.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Combining the constraints on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All routes shown in the options are physically plausible based on these selection rules.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of a Specific Route:**\n    The probability of the atom following one specific cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each individual step.\n    *   **Probability of Step 1:** The most critical point, agreed upon by all valid analyses, is the nature of the initial state. The state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, meaning it is an **s-state** and is **spherically symmetric**. Due to this symmetry and the isotropic nature of spontaneous emission (in the absence of external fields), there is no preferred direction of decay. This means the atom has an equal probability of decaying into each of the three possible magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($m' = -1, 0, 1$). Since there are three equally likely, mutually exclusive outcomes, the probability for any single specific channel is exactly **1/3**.\n    *   **Probability of Step 2:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), its only allowed E1 decay channel is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s ground level). As this is the only available path, the probability of this second transition is **1**.\n    *   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three complete cascade routes is the product of the step probabilities:\n        $P_{route} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    We must find the option that presents a valid decay route and correctly identifies its probability as 1/3.\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and \\frac{1}{3} — **This is correct.** The route is valid, and the probability is calculated correctly.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and \\frac{1}{4} — The probability is incorrect.\n    *   C) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{2}{3} — The probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and \\frac{1}{4} — The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that matches the correct physical analysis is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a consolidated, step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process:** The question describes a quantum mechanical decay of a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   **Mechanism:** The decay happens via two sequential electric dipole (E1) transitions. A direct transition is forbidden by the selection rules (since $\\Delta l=0$), necessitating an intermediate state. The process is a cascade decay: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |\\text{intermediate}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** The rules for allowed transitions are fundamental to this problem.\n    *   **$\\Delta l = \\pm 1$**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly one.\n    *   **$\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$**: The magnetic quantum number can change by at most one.\n    *   **Energy must decrease**: For a decay, the principal quantum number `n` must decrease at each step.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:** We apply the selection rules to both steps of the decay.\n    *   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ to satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n        *   Since the initial state has $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   Energy must decrease, so $n'$ must be less than 3.\n    *   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   To reach the final state with $l=0$, the intermediate state (which we know has $l'=1$) must transition with $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n        *   For the energy to decrease in this step, we must have $n' > 1$.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Combining the conditions on `n'` ($1 < n' < 3$), the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Therefore, the only possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.

The \"probability\" here refers to the branching ratio.\n    *   **Probability of Step 1:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an `s`-state ($l=0$) and is **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space. Due to this symmetry, the spontaneous emission is isotropic, meaning it is equally likely to decay into any of the three possible magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate `l'=1` state. Since there are three equally probable outcomes that constitute all possibilities for this decay, the probability of decaying into any *single* specific channel is precisely **1/3**.\n    *   **Probability of Step 2:** Once the atom is in an intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state, the only possible decay channel to a lower energy state that satisfies the E1 selection rules is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state.

The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that presents a valid physical path with the correctly calculated probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Problem**\nThe question describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the state $|n, l, m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The process is specified as occurring via **two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions**. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state. Our goal is to find a valid decay path and the probability associated with that specific path.\n\nThe cascade looks like this:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### **2. Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules**\nFor a transition to be allowed as an E1 transition, it must obey the following selection rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For spontaneous decay, the atom must lose energy. In the simple non-relativistic model, this means the principal quantum number `n` must decrease.\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because for this transition, $\\Delta l = 0-0 = 0$, violating the selection rule. This confirms the necessity of a two-step process.\n\n### **3. Determine the Intermediate State**\nLet the intermediate state be $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l_{int} = 1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m_{int} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since energy must be released, $n_{int} < 3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The transition is from a state with $l_{int}=1$ to a final state with $l=0$. The change is $\\Delta l = 0-1=-1$, which is allowed.\n    *   The change in `m` is $\\Delta m = 0 - m_{int}$, which is allowed for all possible $m_{int}$.\n    *   Since energy must be released, $n_{int} > 1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the intermediate state:** By combining the conditions on `n`, we find that $1 < n_{int} < 3$. The only possible integer value is $n_{int} = 2$. Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All routes specified in the options are physically valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\nThe probability of a specific route is the product of the probabilities (or branching ratios) of each individual step.\n$P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** This is the probability of the atom in the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state decaying to a specific intermediate state, e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$.\n    *   The crucial physical insight is that the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$ and is therefore **spherically symmetric**.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the correct reasoning, synthesizing the points made by the candidate agents.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process:** The problem describes a two-step cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition.\n    The decay path is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** The rules that govern these transitions are:\n    *   The change in orbital angular momentum must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For a decay, energy must be released, meaning the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    *   **Step 1:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l_{int} = 1$.\n    *   **Step 2:** To reach the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (which has $l=0$) from the intermediate state, a change of $\\Delta l = -1$ is required, confirming that $l_{int}=1$ is correct.\n    *   **Energy Constraint:** The principal quantum number of the intermediate state, $n_{int}$, must be between the initial and final states: $1 < n_{int} < 3$. The only possible integer is $n_{int}=2$.\n    *   **Magnetic Quantum Number:** Since the initial state has $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m_{int} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The three possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle,$ and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All paths shown in the options are physically valid according to the selection rules.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each step.\n    *   **Probability of Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$):** The crucial point, agreed upon by all reasoning agents, is that the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an *s-state* ($l=0$), making it spherically symmetric. Due to this symmetry and the isotropic nature of spontaneous emission (in the absence of external fields), the atom has no preference for which magnetic sublevel to decay into. The decay probability is therefore distributed equally among the three possible intermediate states ($m_{int}=-1, 0, 1$). Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability for any single specific route is **1/3**.\n    *   **Probability of Step 2 ($|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):** Once the atom is in an intermediate $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ state, the only E1-allowed decay channel to a lower energy level is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only path, this transition occurs with a probability of **1**.\n    *   **Total Probability:** The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: $P_{total} = P_{step 1} \\times P_{step 2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    We must find the option that correctly states a valid route and a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. Let's examine the options given in the problem description:\n\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. **This option presents a valid route and the correctly calculated probability.**\n\nThe unanimous reasoning from all candidate answers confirms that the probability for any single valid cascade is 1/3. Only option D matches this conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe problem asks us to identify a valid decay path for a hydrogen atom from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two dipole transitions and to determine the probability of that specific path.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the process and identify the governing rules\nThe decay is a two-step cascade process, mediated by electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nThis process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n1.  **Change in Orbital Angular Momentum Quantum Number ($\\Delta l$):** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  **Change in Magnetic Quantum Number ($\\Delta m$):** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Change in Principal Quantum Number ($\\Delta n$):** For a decay process (spontaneous emission), the atom loses energy, so $n$ must decrease ($n_{\\text{final}} < n_{\\text{initial}}$).\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, violating the selection rule. This confirms the necessity of a two-step process.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the possible intermediate states\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both steps.\n\n*   **For Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. For $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. For $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **For Step 2: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The transition is from $l'=1$ to the final state's $l=0$, so $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $n'$ must be greater than the final state's $n=1$.\n\nCombining the conditions on the principal quantum number, we have $1 < n' < 3$. The only possible integer is $n'=2$.\nTherefore, the possible intermediate states are the three states of the 2p subshell: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes presented in the options are physically possible according to the selection rules.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the probability (branching ratio) of a specific route\nThe total probability of a specific cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1: $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)$**\n    The key physical principle here is the symmetry of the initial state. The $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state is an s-state ($l=0$) and is spherically symmetric. Due to this symmetry and the isotropic nature of the interaction causing spontaneous emission, there is no preferred direction in space for the emitted photon. Consequently, the atom has an equal probability of transitioning into any of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since these three decay channels are the only possibilities and are equally likely, the probability of decaying into any *single* one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2: $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$**\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), its only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available pathway, this transition occurs with a probability of 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the two step-probabilities:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the given options\nWe now look for the option that lists a valid route with the correctly calculated probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that matches our analysis is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Process and Rules\n\n*   **Problem Statement:** We need to find a valid pathway and its associated probability for a hydrogen atom decaying from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n*   **Cascade Decay:** A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden by the E1 selection rules, as the change in orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0$. Therefore, the decay must occur via an intermediate state:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **E1 Selection Rules:** For an allowed transition, the following conditions must be met:\n    1.  The change in orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    3.  For spontaneous emission (decay), the atom must lose energy, which means the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nAll provided solutions correctly apply the selection rules to determine the possible intermediate states, let's call them $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **For the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n', l', m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$, so to satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$, so to satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   For a decay, $n'$ must be less than 3.\n*   **For the second transition ($|n', l', m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The final state has $l=0$. A transition from the intermediate state (which we found must have $l'=1$) is allowed since $\\Delta l = 0-1=-1$.\n    *   For this to be a decay, $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n*   **Combining the constraints:** The intermediate state's principal quantum number must satisfy $1 < n' < 3$. The only possible integer is $n'=2$. Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle,$ and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All routes shown in the options are physically plausible.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Probability\n\nThe \"probability\" in this context refers to the branching ratio for a specific decay path. It is the product of the probabilities of each individual step. This is the crucial point where a decision is made.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 (Branching Ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n    The key insight, universally agreed upon by all provided solutions, is the **spherical symmetry** of the initial $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state (since $l=0$). Because of this symmetry, in the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space for the emitted photon. Consequently, the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability for any single path is precisely **1/3**.\n*   **Probability of Step 2 (Branching Ratio for $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. As this is the only path, the transition is guaranteed to occur. Therefore, the probability for this second step is **1**.\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the step probabilities:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4.

We now evaluate the given options:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$: The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$: **The path is valid, and the probability is correct.**\n*   C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$: The probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$: The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nOnly option B correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a remarkable consensus on the physical principles and calculations required to solve the problem, even though their final letter choices differ due to variations in the options presented to them. The following is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis based on their unanimous reasoning.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Process and Selection Rules:** The problem describes a cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. The key to solving this is to apply the E1 selection rules:\n    *   The change in orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the atom must lose energy, meaning the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n2.  **Verify that a Two-Step Process is Necessary:** A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because the change in orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0-0=0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. This confirms that the decay must proceed via an intermediate state.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:** Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**. The initial state has $l=0$, so to satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$. Since energy must be released, $n' < 3$.\n    *   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**. The final state has $l=0$. This is an allowed transition from a state with $l'=1$ (since $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$). For this to be a decay, $n' > 1$.\n    *   **Conclusion for Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), we find that the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Combined with $l'=1$, and the rule $\\Delta m=0, \\pm 1$ from the first step, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes listed in the options are physically plausible.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of a Specific Route:** This is the most crucial part of the analysis and where the candidate answers show complete agreement in their reasoning. The probability of a specific cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   **Probability of Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$)**: The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an *s-state* ($l=0$) and is therefore **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space. Due to this symmetry, the spontaneous emission process is isotropic (equal in all directions), and the probability of decaying into each of the three possible magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) must be identical. Since there are three equally likely outcomes that account for the total decay probability to this level, the probability of entering any single one of them is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   **Probability of Step 2 ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$)**: Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only state of lower energy that is reachable via an E1 transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s ground state). Since this is the only available decay channel, the probability of this second step is 1.\n    *   **Total Probability**: The total probability for any single, specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: $P_{route} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### **Evaluation of Options**\n\nBased on the consistent and unanimous analysis, any valid decay path through an intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.

    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis using the principles of quantum mechanics for atomic transitions. A careful examination of all the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the physical reasoning, which leads to a definitive conclusion.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Physical Process and Identify the Rules\nThe question describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism is specified as two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means the decay is a two-step cascade process that passes through an intermediate state.\n\nThe process is governed by the **E1 selection rules**:\n1.  **Orbital Angular Momentum:** The quantum number `l` must change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  **Magnetic Quantum Number:** The quantum number `m` must change by $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Energy:** For a spontaneous decay, the atom must lose energy. In the non-relativistic hydrogen atom, this means the principal quantum number `n` must decrease at each step.\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0-0 = 0$, violating the first selection rule. This confirms that a two-step process is necessary.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\nLet the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n', l', m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n*   **Analysis of Step 1:** The transition is from $|3,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **Analysis of Step 2:** The transition is to $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   The final state has $l=0$. A transition from the intermediate state with $l'=1$ is allowed since $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion for the Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, the intermediate state must be a `2p` state. The three possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This means that all the transition *routes* shown in the options are physically valid pathways. The deciding factor is the probability.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe probability of one specific cascade path is the product of the probabilities (also known as branching ratios) of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$)**:\n    *   **Careful Point:** The most critical insight is that the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an `s`-state ($l=0$). All s-states are **spherically symmetric**. This means the atom has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   Because the initial state and the interaction for spontaneous emission are isotropic (in the absence of external fields), the decay has no preferred direction. This means the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state.\n    *   Since there are three equally probable, exhaustive outcomes for this decay step, the probability of decaying into any **single specific** channel is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2 ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$)**:\n    *   Once the atom is in an intermediate state like $|2,1,0\\rangle$, the only decay path to a lower energy state that is allowed by the E1 selection rules is the transition to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state.\n    *   Since this is the only available decay channel, this transition occurs with a probability of **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any of the three complete cascade routes is the product of the two step-probabilities:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\nWe need to find the option that pairs a valid physical route with the correctly calculated probability of `1/3`.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

The mechanism is specified as two sequential electric dipole (E1) transitions, implying a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n    The process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\n    There is universal agreement among the candidate answers on the selection rules governing these transitions:\n    *   The change in orbital angular momentum quantum number: **Δl = ±1**.\n    *   The change in magnetic quantum number: **Δm = 0, ±1**.\n    *   For a spontaneous decay, energy must be released, so the principal quantum number **n must decrease** in each step.\n\n    A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because Δl = 0, which violates the selection rules. This confirms the necessity of the two-step process.\n\n3.  **Identify the Intermediate State**\n    All candidate answers correctly determine the properties of the intermediate state, $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, by applying the selection rules to both steps:\n    *   **First step: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   Initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy Δl=±1, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   Initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy Δm=0,±1, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$.\n    *   **Second step: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   This transition must end at $l=0$, which is consistent with the intermediate state having $l'=1$ (as Δl = -1).\n        *   The principal quantum number must again decrease, so $n' > 1$.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Combining the conditions on n ($1 < n' < 3$), the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Therefore, the only possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that all transition routes shown in the options are physically possible.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n    This is the crucial step that distinguishes the options. There is a strong consensus on the calculation method. The probability of a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   **Probability of Step 1: ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$)**\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an *s*-state ($l=0$) and is **spherically symmetric**. This is a critical point. Due to this symmetry, and in the absence of any external fields, the spontaneous decay is isotropic. This means there is no preferred direction for the emission, and consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three available magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability for any single specific channel is **1/3**.\n    *   **Probability of Step 2: ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$)**\n        Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only allowed E1 decay path to a lower energy level is to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Since this is the only available channel, this transition occurs with a probability of **1**.\n    *   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three complete cascade routes is the product:\n        $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### **Evaluation of the Options**\nBased on the unanimous and correct physical reasoning established above, any valid cascade route has a probability of 1/3. We can now evaluate the given choices:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The transition route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: The transition route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The transition route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The transition route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly pairs a physically allowed transition route with the correctly calculated probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers to determine the final, correct answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Physical Principles and Consensus**\n\nAll fifteen candidate answers, despite occasional variations in the lettering of the final choice, demonstrate a complete consensus on the underlying physics. The solution can be broken down into three core steps, on which all agents agree.\n\n**1. Verifying the Transition Path and Intermediate State**\n\n*   **Problem:** The transition is from the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$ via two electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n*   **Selection Rules:** The E1 selection rules govern this process:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n*   **Determining the Intermediate State:** Let the intermediate state be $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$.\n    *   **First step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$):** The initial state has $l=0$, so to satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l_{int}=1$. Since $n$ must decrease, $n_{int}$ must be less than 3.\n    *   **Second step ($|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):** The final state has $l=0$. To reach this from a state with $l_{int}=1$ is allowed ($\\Delta l = -1$). For this step to also be a decay, $n_{int}$ must be greater than 1.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Combining the conditions on $n_{int}$ ($1 < n_{int} < 3$), the intermediate state must have $n_{int}=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically valid intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes presented in the options are valid pathways.\n\n**2. Calculating the Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe \"probability\" refers to the branching ratio for a specific cascade. This is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$):**\n    This is the most critical part of the problem. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state ($l=0$) and is **spherically symmetric**. Due to this symmetry and the isotropic nature of spontaneous emission (in the absence of external fields), the atom has no preference for the orientation of the final state. This means the probability of transitioning to each of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m_{int}=-1, 0, 1$) is identical. Since these are the only three decay channels to the $n=2$ level, the total probability must be 1, meaning the probability for any single specific channel is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2 ($|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    Once the atom is in an intermediate $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ state, the only decay channel that satisfies the E1 selection rules and lowers its energy is the transition to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only path available, this transition happens with certainty. Its probability is **1**.\n\n*   **Overall Probability:**\n    The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{\\text{route}} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options**\n\nBased on the unanimous physical analysis, any valid decay route will have a probability of 1/3. We now compare this result to the options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly pairs a physically valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Process:** The question describes a quantum mechanical decay of a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Initial state:** `|n, l, m⟩ = |3, 0, 0⟩`. This is the 3s state.\n    *   **Final state:** `|n, l, m⟩ = |1, 0, 0⟩`. This is the 1s ground state.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The decay happens via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means it must pass through an intermediate state. The path is `|3,0,0⟩ → |intermediate state⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`.\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** The rules that govern which transitions are allowed are:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number `l` must be `Δl = ±1`.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number `m` must be `Δm = 0, ±1`.\n    *   For a spontaneous decay, the atom loses energy. In the simple Bohr model, energy depends only on the principal quantum number `n`, so `n` must decrease.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:** Let the intermediate state be `|n', l', m'⟩`. We apply the selection rules to both steps.\n    *   **First step: `|3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩`**:\n        *   The initial state has `l=0`. The `Δl = ±1` rule requires the intermediate state to have `l' = 1`.\n        *   The initial state has `m=0`. The `Δm = 0, ±1` rule allows the intermediate state to have `m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}`.\n        *   The energy must decrease, so `n' < 3`.\n\n    *   **Second step: `|n',l',m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`**:\n        *   The final state has `l=0`. A transition from the intermediate state with `l'=1` satisfies the selection rule (`Δl = 0 - 1 = -1`).\n        *   The energy must decrease, so the intermediate state's principal quantum number must be greater than the final state's, meaning `n' > 1`.\n\n    *   **Conclusion on the intermediate state:** Combining the conditions on `n'` from both steps (`1 < n' < 3`), the intermediate state must have `n'=2`. Therefore, there are three possible intermediate states: `|2,1,-1⟩`, `|2,1,0⟩`, and `|2,1,1⟩`. All routes presented in the options are physically valid paths.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route:** The question asks for the probability of one specific route. This is a branching ratio calculation. The total probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   **Probability of the first step:** The initial state `|3,0,0⟩` is an s-orbital (`l=0`), which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction for the atom. Therefore, the spontaneous decay is isotropic, and the transition probability is the same for each of the three possible final magnetic sublevels (`m'=-1, 0, 1`). Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first decay step, the probability of decaying to any **single** specific `m'` state is `1/3`.\n    *   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in an intermediate state `|2,1,m'⟩` (a 2p state), its only E1-allowed decay channel to a lower energy is the `|1,0,0⟩` ground state. Since this is the only path available, the transition occurs with a probability of 1.\n    *   **Total Probability:** The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n        P_total = P_step1 × P_step2 = (1/3) × 1 = `1/3`.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:** We need to find the option that shows a valid route and has the correct probability of `1/3`. Let's re-examine the options listed in the question:\n    *   A) `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩` and `1/4`: The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩` and `1/3`: The path is valid, and the probability is correct.\n    *   C) `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩` and `1/4`: The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) `⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩` and `2/3`: The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect (and there's a typo).\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct physical reasoning presented by all candidate answers, the only option that is consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the physical process and selection rules\nThe problem describes a two-step decay of a Hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. This means the decay proceeds through an intermediate state:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll the candidate answers correctly identify the E1 selection rules which govern these transitions:\n1.  **Orbital Angular Momentum:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$. This implies the parity of the state must change.\n2.  **Magnetic Quantum Number:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Principal Quantum Number:** For spontaneous decay, the energy must decrease. In the Hydrogen atom, this means the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0-0=0$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the properties of the intermediate state\nAll candidate answers correctly apply the selection rules to find the possible intermediate state(s), let's call it $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **For the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$, so the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ (to satisfy $\\Delta l=\\pm1$).\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$, so the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ (to satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm1$).\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **For the second transition ($|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The transition is from $l'=1$ to $l_{final}=0$, so $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $n' > 1$.\n\nCombining the constraints on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\nTherefore, there are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that all routes listed in the options are physically allowed paths.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the probability (branching ratio) of a specific route\nThis is the deciding factor. All candidate answers that provide reasoning arrive at the same conclusion for the probability calculation.\n\n1.  **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (a 2p level), the only lower-energy state it can decay to via an E1 transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available decay channel, the probability of this step happening is 1.\n\n2.  **Probability of the first step:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state ($l=0$) and is **spherically symmetric**. This is a crucial point. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space for the emitted photon. Therefore, the atom must decay into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) with equal probability.\nSince there are three equally likely outcomes, their probabilities must sum to 1. The probability of transitioning to any single specific sublevel is therefore **1/3**.\n\n3.  **Total probability:** The probability for any of the three complete cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the given options\nBased on the unanimous physical reasoning, any of the three valid decay routes has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. Now we evaluate the options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    The transition route is valid, and the calculated probability is correct.\n\n*   **B) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    The probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly pairs a valid physical process with its correctly calculated probability is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis using the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the rules for atomic transitions. All provided candidate answers arrive at the same physical conclusion, confirming the soundness of the following reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Transition and Identify the Governing Rules**\nThe question describes a decay from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 3s orbital of a hydrogen atom) to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s ground state). The process occurs via two consecutive **electric dipole (E1) transitions**.\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden. This is because the electric dipole selection rules require the orbital angular momentum quantum number, `l`, to change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$. In this case, the change would be $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$. This confirms the necessity of a two-step process through an intermediate state.\n\nThe E1 selection rules are:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number, `n`, must decrease, as the atom loses energy.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\nLet the cascade be represented as $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n', l', m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **For Step 1:** The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$. For a state to exist with $l'=1$, we must have $n' > l'$, so $n' \\ge 2$. The only integer satisfying these conditions is $n'=2$.\n    *   The initial magnetic quantum number is $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Conclusion for the intermediate state:** The decay must proceed through the $n=2, l=1$ (or 2p) level. The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All the decay routes listed in the options are physically plausible based on these selection rules.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability of the Transition Route**\nThe probability of a specific cascade path is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each individual step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2: ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$)**\n    Once the atom is in an intermediate 2p state, its only possible decay path via an E1 transition is to the 1s ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is the only state of lower energy that satisfies the selection rules. Since it is the *only* available decay channel, the probability of this step occurring is 1.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1: ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$)**\n    This is the most critical part of the analysis. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an `s`-state ($l=0$) and is therefore **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, spontaneous emission must be isotropic (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom cannot prefer to transition into one magnetic sublevel ($m'=-1, 0, \\text{or } 1$) over the others. The transition probabilities to each of these three states must be equal. Since these are the only three allowed outcomes for the first step, and their probabilities must sum to 1, the probability for transitioning to any **single specific** intermediate state is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single, complete route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{\\text{total}} = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\nWe now compare our calculated result with the options provided in the question.

Analysis of the Physical Problem**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine a valid decay pathway and its associated probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n**2. Application of Selection Rules**\n\nAll the candidate answers correctly identify the E1 selection rules, which are the fundamental physical principles governing the transition:\n*   The change in orbital angular momentum must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For spontaneous emission (decay), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease, as the atom loses energy.\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (with $l=0$) to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (with $l=0$) is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0$. This confirms the necessity of a two-step process involving an intermediate state.\n\n**3. Determination of the Intermediate State and Possible Routes**\n\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. The analysis proceeds in two steps:\n*   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Since the initial state has $l=0$, the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ dictates that the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease ($n'<3$) but also must be large enough to accommodate an $l'=1$ state (requiring $n' \\ge 2$). The only integer value satisfying these conditions is $n'=2$.\n    *   Since the initial state has $m=0$, the rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n*   **Second transition:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   This transition from $l'=1$ to the final state's $l=0$ is allowed since $\\Delta l = -1$.\n    *   The change in magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$, is also allowed for all possible $m'$ values.\n\n**Conclusion on Routes:** The decay must proceed through one of the three `2p` sublevels: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$. Therefore, all routes listed in the options are physically valid paths. The deciding factor must be the probability.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThis is the most critical step and reveals a strong consensus among the candidate answers.

Final Evaluation**\n\nThe correct answer must describe a valid route and state its probability as $\\frac{1}{3}$. Let's examine the options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and $\\frac{2}{3}$\n    *   The probability is incorrect (and the state description is incomplete).\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   **The route is valid, and the probability is correct.**\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct physical reasoning presented by the candidate answers, the only choice that matches the calculated result is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn analysis of the problem and the provided candidate answers reveals a clear and unanimous conclusion based on the underlying principles of quantum mechanics. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### **1. Understand the Physical Process and Rules**\n\nThe problem asks for a valid pathway and the corresponding probability for a hydrogen atom decaying from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n\nThe key principles are the E1 selection rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Energy must decrease:** For spontaneous emission, the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease at each step.\n\n### **2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l=0$. Therefore, a two-step process is necessary:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{step 1}} |\\text{intermediate}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   **For Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$, so the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ (to satisfy $\\Delta l=\\pm 1$).\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$, so the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $n'<3$.\n*   **For Step 2 ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   This step is from $l'=1$ to $l_{final}=0$, so $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $n'>1$.\n\nCombining the constraints on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Thus, there are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, \\text{and } |2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that the transition routes presented in options A, B, and C are all physically possible.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step. This point is correctly identified by all candidate agents.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state ($l=0$) and is therefore **spherically symmetric**. Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space for the atom to decay. This means it has an equal probability of transitioning into any of the three available magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability for any single one is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** Once the atom is in an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, the only decay channel allowed by the E1 selection rules to a lower energy state is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Since this is the only possible decay route, it occurs with certainty. The probability for this step is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any single, specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{total} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nWe now compare this derived result—that any valid route has a probability of 1/3—with the options provided in the question.\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    This option presents a valid transition route and the correctly calculated probability. This is the correct answer.\n\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    The probability is incorrect (and the initial state is omitted due to a typo).\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct physical reasoning presented by the candidate answers, the only choice that matches the physics is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, based on a synthesis of the provided candidate responses.\n\n### 1. Identify the Physical Process and Rules\nThe question asks to identify a correct decay path and its associated probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\nThe governing principles are the **E1 selection rules**:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For spontaneous decay, energy must be released. In the hydrogen atom, this means the principal quantum number `n` must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determine the Intermediate State and Possible Routes\nThe process is a two-step cascade: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$. Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since the decay releases energy, $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   A transition from the intermediate state with $l'=1$ to the final state with $l=0$ results in $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Since this decay also releases energy, $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n\n*   **Combining Constraints:** The constraints on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$) mean the only possible value is $n'=2$.\n*   **Conclusion on Routes:** The intermediate state must be of the form $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ where $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. Therefore, there are three physically valid decay routes. All routes listed in the options A, B, C, and D are valid physical pathways.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe \"probability\" here refers to the branching ratio for a specific cascade path. The total probability is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):** This is the most important part of the calculation. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, making it an `s`-state. An `s`-state is **spherically symmetric**, meaning it has no preferred orientation in space. Due to this symmetry, the spontaneous decay is isotropic, and the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state. Since there are three equally probable outcomes that constitute all possibilities for this decay step, the probability of decaying into any *one specific* channel is **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2 ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):** Once the atom is in an intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state, its only allowed decay path via E1 transition is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available channel, this transition occurs with a probability of **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The overall probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Options and Conclude\nBased on the unanimous physical reasoning from all provided analyses, any of the three possible decay routes has a probability of 1/3. We now evaluate the specific options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. **The route is valid, and the probability is correct.**\n\nThe final correct choice is the one that combines a valid path with the calculated probability of 1/3.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers, there is an overwhelming consensus on the physical principles and calculations required to solve the problem. The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidates stem from different orderings of the multiple-choice options they were presented with. The following is a consolidated, step-by-step breakdown of the correct reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process and Rules:**\n    *   **Process**: The problem describes a two-step cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   **Mechanism**: Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition.\n    *   **Governing Rules**: The decay must adhere to the E1 selection rules:\n        *   Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n        *   Change in magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n        *   Change in principal quantum number for decay: $\\Delta n < 0$ (energy decreases).\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l=0$. The decay must proceed through an intermediate state, $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   The initial state has $l=0$, so the `Δl=±1` rule requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n        *   The initial state has $m=0$, so the `Δm=0,±1` rule allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   The energy must decrease, so $n'$ must be less than 3.\n    *   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   The final state has $l=0$, so the transition from an intermediate state with $l'=1$ satisfies the `Δl=±1` rule ($\\Delta l = -1$).\n        *   The energy must decrease, so the intermediate state must have $n'$ greater than 1.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Combining the constraints on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All routes shown in the options are physically plausible based on these selection rules.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of a Specific Route:**\n    The probability of the atom following one specific cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each individual step.\n    *   **Probability of Step 1:** The most critical point, agreed upon by all valid analyses, is the nature of the initial state. The state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, meaning it is an **s-state** and is **spherically symmetric**. Due to this symmetry and the isotropic nature of spontaneous emission (in the absence of external fields), there is no preferred direction of decay. This means the atom has an equal probability of decaying into each of the three possible magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($m' = -1, 0, 1$). Since there are three equally likely, mutually exclusive outcomes, the probability for any single specific channel is exactly **1/3**.\n    *   **Probability of Step 2:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), its only allowed E1 decay channel is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s ground level). As this is the only available path, the probability of this second transition is **1**.\n    *   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three complete cascade routes is the product of the step probabilities:\n        $P_{route} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    We must find the option that presents a valid decay route and correctly identifies its probability as 1/3.\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and \\frac{1}{3} — **This is correct.** The route is valid, and the probability is calculated correctly.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and \\frac{1}{4} — The probability is incorrect.\n    *   C) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{2}{3} — The probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and \\frac{1}{4} — The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that matches the correct physical analysis is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a consolidated, step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process:** The question describes a quantum mechanical decay of a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   **Mechanism:** The decay happens via two sequential electric dipole (E1) transitions. A direct transition is forbidden by the selection rules (since $\\Delta l=0$), necessitating an intermediate state. The process is a cascade decay: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |\\text{intermediate}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** The rules for allowed transitions are fundamental to this problem.\n    *   **$\\Delta l = \\pm 1$**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly one.\n    *   **$\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$**: The magnetic quantum number can change by at most one.\n    *   **Energy must decrease**: For a decay, the principal quantum number `n` must decrease at each step.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:** We apply the selection rules to both steps of the decay.\n    *   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ to satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n        *   Since the initial state has $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   Energy must decrease, so $n'$ must be less than 3.\n    *   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   To reach the final state with $l=0$, the intermediate state (which we know has $l'=1$) must transition with $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n        *   For the energy to decrease in this step, we must have $n' > 1$.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Combining the conditions on `n'` ($1 < n' < 3$), the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Therefore, the only possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.

Due to this symmetry, the spontaneous emission is isotropic, meaning it is equally likely to decay into any of the three possible magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate `l'=1` state. Since there are three equally probable outcomes that constitute all possibilities for this decay, the probability of decaying into any *single* specific channel is precisely **1/3**.\n    *   **Probability of Step 2:** Once the atom is in an intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state, the only possible decay channel to a lower energy state that satisfies the E1 selection rules is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state.

Understand the Problem**\nThe question describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the state $|n, l, m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The process is specified as occurring via **two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions**. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state. Our goal is to find a valid decay path and the probability associated with that specific path.\n\nThe cascade looks like this:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### **2. Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules**\nFor a transition to be allowed as an E1 transition, it must obey the following selection rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For spontaneous decay, the atom must lose energy. In the simple non-relativistic model, this means the principal quantum number `n` must decrease.\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because for this transition, $\\Delta l = 0-0 = 0$, violating the selection rule. This confirms the necessity of a two-step process.\n\n### **3. Determine the Intermediate State**\nLet the intermediate state be $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l_{int} = 1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m_{int} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since energy must be released, $n_{int} < 3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The transition is from a state with $l_{int}=1$ to a final state with $l=0$. The change is $\\Delta l = 0-1=-1$, which is allowed.\n    *   The change in `m` is $\\Delta m = 0 - m_{int}$, which is allowed for all possible $m_{int}$.\n    *   Since energy must be released, $n_{int} > 1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the intermediate state:** By combining the conditions on `n`, we find that $1 < n_{int} < 3$. The only possible integer value is $n_{int} = 2$. Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All routes specified in the options are physically valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\nThe probability of a specific route is the product of the probabilities (or branching ratios) of each individual step.\n$P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** This is the probability of the atom in the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state decaying to a specific intermediate state, e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$.\n    *   The crucial physical insight is that the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$ and is therefore **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   In spontaneous emission (without external fields), the decay is isotropic. This means there is an equal probability of the atom transitioning into each of the available magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state.\n    *   Since there are three equally likely intermediate states ($m_{int}=-1, 0, 1$), the probability of decaying into any single one of them is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** This is the probability of the atom, once in an intermediate state like $|2,1,0\\rangle$, decaying to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Once the atom is in a $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ state (a 2p level), its only possible E1 decay channel to a lower energy is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of this second step occurring is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three complete cascade routes is:\n    $P(\\text{total}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### **5.

Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition.\n    The decay path is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** The rules that govern these transitions are:\n    *   The change in orbital angular momentum must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For a decay, energy must be released, meaning the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    *   **Step 1:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l_{int} = 1$.\n    *   **Step 2:** To reach the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (which has $l=0$) from the intermediate state, a change of $\\Delta l = -1$ is required, confirming that $l_{int}=1$ is correct.\n    *   **Energy Constraint:** The principal quantum number of the intermediate state, $n_{int}$, must be between the initial and final states: $1 < n_{int} < 3$. The only possible integer is $n_{int}=2$.\n    *   **Magnetic Quantum Number:** Since the initial state has $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m_{int} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The three possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle,$ and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All paths shown in the options are physically valid according to the selection rules.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each step.\n    *   **Probability of Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$):** The crucial point, agreed upon by all reasoning agents, is that the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an *s-state* ($l=0$), making it spherically symmetric. Due to this symmetry and the isotropic nature of spontaneous emission (in the absence of external fields), the atom has no preference for which magnetic sublevel to decay into. The decay probability is therefore distributed equally among the three possible intermediate states ($m_{int}=-1, 0, 1$). Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability for any single specific route is **1/3**.\n    *   **Probability of Step 2 ($|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):** Once the atom is in an intermediate $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ state, the only E1-allowed decay channel to a lower energy level is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only path, this transition occurs with a probability of **1**.\n    *   **Total Probability:** The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: $P_{total} = P_{step 1} \\times P_{step 2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    We must find the option that correctly states a valid route and a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. Let's examine the options given in the problem description:\n\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. **This option presents a valid route and the correctly calculated probability.**\n\nThe unanimous reasoning from all candidate answers confirms that the probability for any single valid cascade is 1/3. Only option D matches this conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe problem asks us to identify a valid decay path for a hydrogen atom from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two dipole transitions and to determine the probability of that specific path.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the process and identify the governing rules\nThe decay is a two-step cascade process, mediated by electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nThis process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n1.  **Change in Orbital Angular Momentum Quantum Number ($\\Delta l$):** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  **Change in Magnetic Quantum Number ($\\Delta m$):** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Change in Principal Quantum Number ($\\Delta n$):** For a decay process (spontaneous emission), the atom loses energy, so $n$ must decrease ($n_{\\text{final}} < n_{\\text{initial}}$).\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, violating the selection rule. This confirms the necessity of a two-step process.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the possible intermediate states\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both steps.\n\n*   **For Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. For $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. For $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **For Step 2: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The transition is from $l'=1$ to the final state's $l=0$, so $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $n'$ must be greater than the final state's $n=1$.\n\nCombining the conditions on the principal quantum number, we have $1 < n' < 3$. The only possible integer is $n'=2$.\nTherefore, the possible intermediate states are the three states of the 2p subshell: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes presented in the options are physically possible according to the selection rules.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the probability (branching ratio) of a specific route\nThe total probability of a specific cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1: $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)$**\n    The key physical principle here is the symmetry of the initial state. The $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state is an s-state ($l=0$) and is spherically symmetric. Due to this symmetry and the isotropic nature of the interaction causing spontaneous emission, there is no preferred direction in space for the emitted photon. Consequently, the atom has an equal probability of transitioning into any of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since these three decay channels are the only possibilities and are equally likely, the probability of decaying into any *single* one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2: $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$**\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), its only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available pathway, this transition occurs with a probability of 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the two step-probabilities:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the given options\nWe now look for the option that lists a valid route with the correctly calculated probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that matches our analysis is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Process and Rules\n\n*   **Problem Statement:** We need to find a valid pathway and its associated probability for a hydrogen atom decaying from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n*   **Cascade Decay:** A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden by the E1 selection rules, as the change in orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0$. Therefore, the decay must occur via an intermediate state:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **E1 Selection Rules:** For an allowed transition, the following conditions must be met:\n    1.  The change in orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    3.  For spontaneous emission (decay), the atom must lose energy, which means the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nAll provided solutions correctly apply the selection rules to determine the possible intermediate states, let's call them $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **For the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n', l', m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$, so to satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$, so to satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   For a decay, $n'$ must be less than 3.\n*   **For the second transition ($|n', l', m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The final state has $l=0$. A transition from the intermediate state (which we found must have $l'=1$) is allowed since $\\Delta l = 0-1=-1$.\n    *   For this to be a decay, $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n*   **Combining the constraints:** The intermediate state's principal quantum number must satisfy $1 < n' < 3$. The only possible integer is $n'=2$. Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle,$ and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All routes shown in the options are physically plausible.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Probability\n\nThe \"probability\" in this context refers to the branching ratio for a specific decay path. It is the product of the probabilities of each individual step. This is the crucial point where a decision is made.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 (Branching Ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n    The key insight, universally agreed upon by all provided solutions, is the **spherical symmetry** of the initial $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state (since $l=0$). Because of this symmetry, in the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space for the emitted photon. Consequently, the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability for any single path is precisely **1/3**.\n*   **Probability of Step 2 (Branching Ratio for $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. As this is the only path, the transition is guaranteed to occur. Therefore, the probability for this second step is **1**.\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the step probabilities:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Conclusion and Evaluation of Options\n\nBased on the flawless consensus from all provided analyses, any specific valid route has a probability of 1/3. We now evaluate the given options:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$: The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$: **The path is valid, and the probability is correct.**\n*   C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$: The probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$: The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nOnly option B correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a remarkable consensus on the physical principles and calculations required to solve the problem, even though their final letter choices differ due to variations in the options presented to them. The following is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis based on their unanimous reasoning.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Process and Selection Rules:** The problem describes a cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. The key to solving this is to apply the E1 selection rules:\n    *   The change in orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the atom must lose energy, meaning the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n2.  **Verify that a Two-Step Process is Necessary:** A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because the change in orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0-0=0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. This confirms that the decay must proceed via an intermediate state.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:** Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**. The initial state has $l=0$, so to satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$. Since energy must be released, $n' < 3$.\n    *   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**. The final state has $l=0$. This is an allowed transition from a state with $l'=1$ (since $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$). For this to be a decay, $n' > 1$.\n    *   **Conclusion for Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), we find that the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Combined with $l'=1$, and the rule $\\Delta m=0, \\pm 1$ from the first step, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes listed in the options are physically plausible.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of a Specific Route:** This is the most crucial part of the analysis and where the candidate answers show complete agreement in their reasoning. The probability of a specific cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   **Probability of Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$)**: The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an *s-state* ($l=0$) and is therefore **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space. Due to this symmetry, the spontaneous emission process is isotropic (equal in all directions), and the probability of decaying into each of the three possible magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) must be identical. Since there are three equally likely outcomes that account for the total decay probability to this level, the probability of entering any single one of them is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   **Probability of Step 2 ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$)**: Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only state of lower energy that is reachable via an E1 transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s ground state). Since this is the only available decay channel, the probability of this second step is 1.\n    *   **Total Probability**: The total probability for any single, specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: $P_{route} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### **Evaluation of Options**\n\nBased on the consistent and unanimous analysis, any valid decay path through an intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. We can now evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly pairs a physically allowed transition route with the correctly calculated probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
