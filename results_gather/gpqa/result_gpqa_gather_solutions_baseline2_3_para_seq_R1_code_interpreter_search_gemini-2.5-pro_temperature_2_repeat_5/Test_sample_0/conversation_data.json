This is a direct application of the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. The principle is mathematically stated as:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nThis principle dictates that a state with a finite lifetime (Δt, which we can approximate as the lifetime τ) has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy (ΔE). For practical calculations, we use the approximation:\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\nThis ΔE is also known as the \"natural linewidth\" of the energy level. A shorter lifetime implies a larger energy width.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Condition for Clear Resolution**\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the two \"smeared\" energy distributions will overlap to a degree where they are indistinguishable. The resolution is primarily limited by the state with the *larger* energy width, which is the state with the *shorter* lifetime. A robust criterion is that the energy separation must be greater than the sum of the individual widths (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂).\n\n**Step 3: Perform the Calculation**\nFirst, we list the given information and the necessary physical constant:\n*   Lifetime of state 1: τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Lifetime of state 2: τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Reduced Planck constant: ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\nNext, we calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state:\n*   **State 1 (shorter lifetime, broader width):**\n    ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n*   **State 2 (longer lifetime, narrower width):**\n    ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Minimum Required Energy Separation**\nUsing the resolution condition, the energy separation must be larger than the energy widths. The larger of the two widths is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. For the levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference should be significantly larger than this value. Applying the stricter condition (sum of the widths):\nMinimum separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 × 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\nTherefore, we are looking for an option that is comfortably greater than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options**\nNow we compare the required separation with the provided options:\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value (which is 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV) is much larger than the required separation of ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This would allow the states to be clearly resolved.\n*   **B) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This value is much smaller than the required separation.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This value (which is 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV) is smaller than the required separation.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This value (which is 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV) is much smaller than the required separation.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis consistently shows that an energy separation greater than approximately 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV is necessary to distinguish the two energy levels. Among the given choices, only 10⁻⁴ eV satisfies this condition.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Governing Physical Principle**\nThe problem involves the lifetime of quantum states and our ability to distinguish their energy levels. This is a direct application of the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. This principle states that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt) has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy (ΔE). The mathematical relationship is:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\nFor calculation purposes, we can approximate the minimum energy width (also known as the natural linewidth) as:\nΔE ≈ ħ/τ\nwhere τ is the lifetime of the state and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** We must use the reduced Planck constant (ħ), not the Planck constant (h). The value in electron-volt-seconds (eV·s) is most convenient as the options are in eV. ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**\nThe energy width is inversely proportional to the lifetime; a shorter lifetime means a larger, more uncertain energy.\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Note that the state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width. This larger width will be the primary limiting factor for distinguishing the two states.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"**\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the energy difference between them must be significantly larger than their inherent energy widths. If the energy separation is smaller than their widths, the energy profiles of the states will overlap to the point where they are indistinguishable.\n\n*   A common and safe criterion is that the energy difference, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than the *sum* of the individual widths.\n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV) ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   A less strict, but still valid, criterion is that the separation must be greater than the *larger* of the two widths.\n    |E₁ - E₂| > max(ΔE₁, ΔE₂) = ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Both criteria lead to the same conclusion: the required energy separation must be on the order of 10⁻⁷ eV or greater. We are looking for an option that clearly satisfies this condition.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options against the Condition**\nWe need to find the option that is greater than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is smaller than 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV = 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is much smaller than 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) **10⁻⁴ eV** = 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is significantly larger than 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOnly an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished, as it is the only value substantially greater than the natural energy width of the states. The other options are smaller than the required separation, meaning the energy levels would overlap and be unresolved.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to reach the final, consolidated answer.\n\n**1.

This principle establishes a fundamental limit on the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties can be known. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the uncertainty in time (interpreted here as the lifetime of the state, τ), and ħ is the reduced Planck constant. For practical estimations, the minimum energy width (ΔE) or \"natural linewidth\" of a state is approximated as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n**2. State the Condition for Resolution**\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their inherent energy widths.

Final Conclusion and Synthesis**\n\nThere is an overwhelming consensus among all candidate answers regarding the physics and the calculation. They all correctly compute that the energy widths are on the order of 10⁻⁷ eV and 10⁻⁸ eV, and that for the levels to be resolved, their separation must be greater than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The state with the *shorter* lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the *larger* energy width, which is the primary factor limiting resolution.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The calculated required separation of ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV is a minimum threshold.

However, the *numerical value* of the correct answer, 10⁻⁴ eV, is consistent across all sound analyses. Mapping this correct numerical value to the specific option list in the question prompt leads to a single unambiguous answer.\n\nBased on the prompt's option list, 10⁻⁴ eV is option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Identify the Core Physical Principle\nThe fundamental principle governing this problem is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. This principle establishes a trade-off between the precision with which a quantum state's energy is known (ΔE) and the duration for which the state exists, its lifetime (Δt or τ). The relationship is expressed as:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nFor calculations, this is often approximated as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. This energy uncertainty, ΔE, is the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy width\" of the state. A shorter lifetime implies a larger, more \"smeared-out\" energy level.\n\n### 2. State the Condition for Resolution\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference between their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their inherent energy widths. If the separation is smaller than the widths, the two energy profiles will overlap to such a degree that they become indistinguishable. The limiting factor is always the state with the **larger energy width**, which corresponds to the **shorter lifetime**. A robust criterion is that the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual widths (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂), but even a less strict condition that the difference must be larger than the widest level is sufficient for this problem.\n\n### 3. Perform the Necessary Calculations\nThe next step is to calculate the energy width for each state using the provided lifetimes and the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n*   **Given Lifetimes:**\n    *   τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n\n*   **Energy Width for State 1:**\n    ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **Energy Width for State 2:**\n    ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\nThe resolution is limited by the larger of these two widths, which is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. Therefore, to clearly resolve the states, the energy difference between them must be greater than this value. Using the stricter sum criterion: Required separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. In either case, the required separation must be on the order of **10⁻⁷ eV or larger**.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Given Options\nNow, we compare the given options to the requirement that the energy difference must be significantly greater than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV  (This is smaller than the required separation)\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV = 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV (This is much smaller than the required separation)\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV = 0.0001 × 10⁻⁷ eV (This is much smaller than the required separation)\n*   D) **10⁻⁴ eV** = 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV (This is orders of magnitude larger than the required separation)\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n*   **Consensus:** All provided candidate answers correctly identify the Uncertainty Principle and perform the calculations to find the energy widths. There is a unanimous agreement that the required energy separation must be on the order of 10⁻⁷ eV or more, and thus the numerical answer must be 10⁻⁴ eV.\n*   **Inconsistency:** The different letters (A, B, C, D) chosen by the various agents are a result of being presented with the options in a different, randomized order. This is a common artifact in such systems and does not reflect a disagreement on the physics.\n*   **Final Decision:** The physical reasoning is sound and consistent across all provided analyses. The energy separation must be greater than the lifetime-induced energy width of the states. Only 10⁻⁴ eV satisfies this condition, as it is much larger than the calculated minimum separation of ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Based on the options list in the problem statement, 10⁻⁴ eV corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the candidate answers, here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Governing Physical Principle\nThe problem connects the lifetime of a quantum state to the precision with which its energy can be determined. This is a direct application of the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. This principle states that for a state with a finite lifetime Δt (or τ), there is an unavoidable uncertainty in its energy ΔE. The mathematical relationship is:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nFor estimations, we approximate the minimum energy uncertainty, known as the natural linewidth, as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n### Step 2: Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the energy difference between them must be significantly larger than their inherent energy widths. The energy widths can be thought of as a \"smearing\" of the energy levels; if the separation is too small, these smeared profiles will overlap to the point where they are indistinguishable. The resolution is limited by the state with the **larger energy width**, which corresponds to the **shorter lifetime**. Therefore, a necessary condition for resolution is that the energy difference |E₁ - E₂| must be greater than the larger of the two widths.\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Calculations\nWe need to calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state.\n\n*   **Given Lifetimes:**\n    *   τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n\n*   **Energy Width of State 1:**\n    ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **Energy Width of State 2:**\n    ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\nThe larger energy width is ΔE₁, which is approximately 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is the primary limiting factor for resolution. The energy difference between the two states must be greater than this value.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\nWe now compare the options provided in the question to our calculated requirement (|E₁ - E₂| > 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV).\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁸ eV**: This is 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is **smaller** than the required separation.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁴ eV**: This is 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is much **larger** than the required separation.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁹ eV**: This is 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is much **smaller** than the required separation.\n*   **D) 10⁻¹¹ eV**: This is much **smaller** than the required separation.\n\n### Conclusion and Final Answer\nOnly the energy difference of **10⁻⁴ eV** is sufficiently large to ensure the two broadened energy levels can be clearly distinguished. The analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the physics and the numerical result (10⁻⁴ eV). Any discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) were due to the options being listed in a different order for each agent, not from an error in the physical reasoning.

The analysis proceeds by synthesizing the reasoning provided by the various candidate agents.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle:**\n    There is a unanimous consensus among all reasoned candidate answers. The problem is governed by the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time**. This fundamental principle of quantum mechanics states that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt or τ) cannot have a perfectly defined energy. Instead, its energy has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" (ΔE). The mathematical relationship is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    For practical calculations of this energy width (also called the natural linewidth), the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ/τ is used.\n    *   **ΔE**: Uncertainty in energy.\n    *   **τ**: Lifetime of the state.\n    *   **ħ**: The reduced Planck constant, which is approximately **6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s**.\n\n2.  **Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\":**\n    To \"clearly distinguish\" or resolve two energy levels, the difference in their central energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the energy separation is smaller than the widths, their smeared energy profiles will overlap to such an extent that they are indistinguishable. The primary limitation comes from the state with the *larger* energy width, which is the state with the *shorter* lifetime.\n    A good criterion for resolution is that the energy difference must be larger than the largest energy width. An even stricter (and safer) criterion is that the difference should be larger than the sum of both widths. Given that the answer options are orders of magnitude apart, either criterion will yield the same result.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculations:**\n    We need to calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state using their given lifetimes.\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n4.  **Determine the Minimum Required Separation:**\n    The larger of the two energy widths is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is the main factor limiting the resolution. Therefore, to clearly distinguish the two levels, their energy difference must be greater than this value.\n    Required Energy Separation > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    Now, we compare this requirement with the options provided in the question:\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is far smaller than the required 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This is equal to 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is much **larger** than the required separation. This would allow for clear resolution.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is far smaller than the required 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is equal to 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is smaller than the required separation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis, which is overwhelmingly supported by all the provided candidate answers, shows that the energy widths of the states are on the order of 10⁻⁷ eV and 10⁻⁸ eV. To resolve them, the energy difference must be larger than the broader of these two widths. Out of the given choices, only 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to meet this condition.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle\nThe fundamental principle governing this problem is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. This principle establishes a limit on the precision with which we can simultaneously know a quantum state's energy and its lifetime. The relationship is mathematically expressed as:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in the state's energy.\n*   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).\n\nFor practical calculations, the minimum energy uncertainty, often called the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy width\" (Γ), is approximated by:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nwhere τ is the lifetime of the state.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Energy Width for Each State\nWe need to calculate the energy width (ΔE) for both quantum states using their given lifetimes. The value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) is approximately **6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s**.\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n**Careful Point:** A shorter lifetime implies a larger, more \"smeared out\" energy width. As calculated, State 1 has the shorter lifetime and therefore the larger energy width (ΔE₁ > ΔE₂).\n\n### Step 3: Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the energy separation is smaller than the widths, their energy profiles will overlap to such a degree that they are indistinguishable. The resolution is primarily limited by the state with the larger energy width.\n\nTherefore, the condition for resolution is:\n\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nA more stringent criterion sometimes used is that the separation must be greater than the sum of the widths (|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV). Given that the provided options are separated by several orders of magnitude, both criteria lead to the same conclusion.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\nWe must now compare the provided options with the required minimum energy separation of approximately 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁸ eV**: This is equal to 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is **smaller** than the required separation.\n*   **B) 10⁻¹¹ eV**: This is significantly **smaller** than the required separation.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁴ eV**: This is equal to 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is significantly **larger** than the required separation.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁹ eV**: This is equal to 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is significantly **smaller** than the required separation.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis shows that the energy difference must be greater than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV for the two energy levels to be clearly resolved. Out of the given choices, only 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to satisfy this condition. The overwhelming consensus among the candidate agents on the physics and numerical value confirms this conclusion.

Of the options provided, only 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to satisfy this condition. The discrepancies in the letter choices among the candidate answers are due to a random shuffling of the options, but their underlying physical reasoning and numerical conclusions are consistent and correct.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the problem and a review of the provided candidate answers, here is a detailed breakdown of the reasoning to reach the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle\n\nThe question requires us to determine the necessary energy separation to distinguish two quantum states with finite lifetimes. This is a direct application of the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. The principle states that for a quantum state with a specific lifetime (Δt), there is an unavoidable uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). This relationship is mathematically expressed as:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nFor estimations, we can use the approximation **ΔE ≈ ħ/τ**, where:\n*   **ΔE** is the energy uncertainty, also known as the natural linewidth or energy width.\n*   **τ** is the lifetime of the state.\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant, approximately **6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s**.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Condition for Resolution\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved,\" the energy difference between them must be larger than their respective energy widths. If the separation is too small, their energy profiles (which are \"smeared out\" by their widths) will overlap so much that they become indistinguishable. The limiting factor is the state with the **shorter lifetime**, as it will have the **larger energy width**. A conservative condition for clear resolution is that the energy separation, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than the sum of the individual widths (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Energy Width for Each State\n\nWe are given the lifetimes:\n*   Lifetime of state 1: τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Lifetime of state 2: τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n\nNow we calculate the corresponding energy widths:\n\n*   **Energy width of State 1 (ΔE₁):**\n    ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **Energy width of State 2 (ΔE₂):**\n    ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Minimum Required Energy Separation\n\nThe required separation for clear resolution must be greater than the sum of the widths:\nRequired Separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\nRequired Separation > (6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\nRequired Separation > 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nTherefore, to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, their energy difference must be significantly greater than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options\n\nWe must compare the given options with this requirement:\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV**: This is equal to 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is much **larger** than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV, so this separation is sufficient.\n*   **B) 10⁻¹¹ eV**: This is much **smaller** than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁸ eV**: This is 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is **smaller** than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁹ eV**: This is 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is **smaller** than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy separation that is orders of magnitude larger than the combined energy widths, guaranteeing that the two levels can be clearly resolved. The other options represent energy differences that are smaller than the natural width of the states, making resolution impossible.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points for reaching the correct conclusion.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle\n\nThe problem requires determining the necessary energy separation to distinguish two quantum states with known, finite lifetimes. All the candidate answers correctly identify that this is a direct application of the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. The principle establishes a fundamental limit on the precision with which the energy of a state (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt or τ) can be simultaneously known. The relationship is:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nFor practical calculations, the minimum energy uncertainty, known as the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy width,\" is approximated by:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ/τ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Energy Width for Each State\n\nWe use the provided lifetimes and the value of ħ to find the energy width of each state.\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy Width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy Width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n### Step 3: Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" the two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their inherent energy widths. Each level is not a sharp line but is \"smeared out\" over a range ΔE. If the separation between the levels is smaller than these widths, their profiles will overlap to the point where they are indistinguishable. The resolution is limited by the state with the *larger* energy width.\n\n*   **Required Separation > Largest Width**: A basic condition is that the separation must be greater than the larger of the two widths, which is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **Required Separation > Sum of Widths**: A more robust criterion is that the separation must be greater than the sum of both widths: ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nGiven the large differences between the options, either criterion leads to the same answer. We need an energy separation greater than approximately 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\n\nNow we compare the calculated requirement with the options provided in the question:\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (Much smaller than the required 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV    (Much smaller than the required 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV    (Smaller than the required 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV** (Equal to 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is much larger than the required 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\nOnly the energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is sufficiently large to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Inverse Relationship:** It is critical to remember that the *shorter* lifetime (τ = 10⁻⁹ s) corresponds to the *larger* energy width (ΔE ≈ 10⁻⁷ eV). This larger width is the primary factor limiting the resolution.\n2.  **Resolution Means Separation > Width:** The core concept is that for levels to be distinct, their energy separation must be significantly *greater* than their inherent widths. An energy separation smaller than the widths would mean the energy profiles overlap significantly, making them unresolved.\n3.  **Analyzing Candidate Answer Discrepancies:** The candidate answers show unanimous agreement on the physics, the calculation, and the final numerical value of 10⁻⁴ eV. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are an artifact of the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, randomized order to each agent. This does not indicate a disagreement on the correct answer, but rather a difference in the test-taking environment.\n4.  **Final Mapping:** The correct procedure is to perform the physical calculation to find the required numerical value (10⁻⁴ eV) and then map it to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\nFor the given options, the value 10⁻⁴ eV corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

This is a direct application of the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. The principle is mathematically stated as:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nThis principle dictates that a state with a finite lifetime (Δt, which we can approximate as the lifetime τ) has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy (ΔE). For practical calculations, we use the approximation:\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\nThis ΔE is also known as the \"natural linewidth\" of the energy level. A shorter lifetime implies a larger energy width.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Condition for Clear Resolution**\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the two \"smeared\" energy distributions will overlap to a degree where they are indistinguishable. The resolution is primarily limited by the state with the *larger* energy width, which is the state with the *shorter* lifetime. A robust criterion is that the energy separation must be greater than the sum of the individual widths (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂).\n\n**Step 3: Perform the Calculation**\nFirst, we list the given information and the necessary physical constant:\n*   Lifetime of state 1: τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Lifetime of state 2: τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Reduced Planck constant: ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\nNext, we calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state:\n*   **State 1 (shorter lifetime, broader width):**\n    ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n*   **State 2 (longer lifetime, narrower width):**\n    ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Minimum Required Energy Separation**\nUsing the resolution condition, the energy separation must be larger than the energy widths. The larger of the two widths is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. For the levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference should be significantly larger than this value. Applying the stricter condition (sum of the widths):\nMinimum separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 × 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\nTherefore, we are looking for an option that is comfortably greater than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options**\nNow we compare the required separation with the provided options:\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value (which is 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV) is much larger than the required separation of ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.

This is a direct application of the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. This principle states that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt) has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy (ΔE). The mathematical relationship is:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\nFor calculation purposes, we can approximate the minimum energy width (also known as the natural linewidth) as:\nΔE ≈ ħ/τ\nwhere τ is the lifetime of the state and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** We must use the reduced Planck constant (ħ), not the Planck constant (h). The value in electron-volt-seconds (eV·s) is most convenient as the options are in eV. ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**\nThe energy width is inversely proportional to the lifetime; a shorter lifetime means a larger, more uncertain energy.\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Note that the state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width. This larger width will be the primary limiting factor for distinguishing the two states.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"**\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the energy difference between them must be significantly larger than their inherent energy widths.

Identify the Core Physical Principle\nThe fundamental principle governing this problem is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. This principle establishes a trade-off between the precision with which a quantum state's energy is known (ΔE) and the duration for which the state exists, its lifetime (Δt or τ). The relationship is expressed as:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nFor calculations, this is often approximated as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. This energy uncertainty, ΔE, is the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy width\" of the state. A shorter lifetime implies a larger, more \"smeared-out\" energy level.\n\n### 2. State the Condition for Resolution\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference between their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their inherent energy widths. If the separation is smaller than the widths, the two energy profiles will overlap to such a degree that they become indistinguishable. The limiting factor is always the state with the **larger energy width**, which corresponds to the **shorter lifetime**. A robust criterion is that the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual widths (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂), but even a less strict condition that the difference must be larger than the widest level is sufficient for this problem.\n\n### 3. Perform the Necessary Calculations\nThe next step is to calculate the energy width for each state using the provided lifetimes and the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n*   **Given Lifetimes:**\n    *   τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n\n*   **Energy Width for State 1:**\n    ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **Energy Width for State 2:**\n    ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\nThe resolution is limited by the larger of these two widths, which is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. Therefore, to clearly resolve the states, the energy difference between them must be greater than this value. Using the stricter sum criterion: Required separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. In either case, the required separation must be on the order of **10⁻⁷ eV or larger**.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Given Options\nNow, we compare the given options to the requirement that the energy difference must be significantly greater than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV  (This is smaller than the required separation)\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV = 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV (This is much smaller than the required separation)\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV = 0.0001 × 10⁻⁷ eV (This is much smaller than the required separation)\n*   D) **10⁻⁴ eV** = 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV (This is orders of magnitude larger than the required separation)\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n*   **Consensus:** All provided candidate answers correctly identify the Uncertainty Principle and perform the calculations to find the energy widths. There is a unanimous agreement that the required energy separation must be on the order of 10⁻⁷ eV or more, and thus the numerical answer must be 10⁻⁴ eV.\n*   **Inconsistency:** The different letters (A, B, C, D) chosen by the various agents are a result of being presented with the options in a different, randomized order. This is a common artifact in such systems and does not reflect a disagreement on the physics.\n*   **Final Decision:** The physical reasoning is sound and consistent across all provided analyses. The energy separation must be greater than the lifetime-induced energy width of the states. Only 10⁻⁴ eV satisfies this condition, as it is much larger than the calculated minimum separation of ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Based on the options list in the problem statement, 10⁻⁴ eV corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the candidate answers, here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Governing Physical Principle\nThe problem connects the lifetime of a quantum state to the precision with which its energy can be determined. This is a direct application of the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. This principle states that for a state with a finite lifetime Δt (or τ), there is an unavoidable uncertainty in its energy ΔE. The mathematical relationship is:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nFor estimations, we approximate the minimum energy uncertainty, known as the natural linewidth, as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n### Step 2: Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the energy difference between them must be significantly larger than their inherent energy widths. The energy widths can be thought of as a \"smearing\" of the energy levels; if the separation is too small, these smeared profiles will overlap to the point where they are indistinguishable. The resolution is limited by the state with the **larger energy width**, which corresponds to the **shorter lifetime**.

The principle states that a state with a finite lifetime (Δt) has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy (ΔE). The relationship is given by:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nFor practical calculations of this energy width (also known as the natural linewidth, Γ), we can use the approximation:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nwhere τ is the lifetime of the state, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Energy Width of Each State\nA key point is that a shorter lifetime corresponds to a larger, more \"smeared-out\" energy width. We must calculate this for both states.\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" these two energy levels, the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the separation is too small, their energy profiles will overlap to the point where they are indistinguishable. The resolution is limited by the state with the *larger* energy width, which is State 1 (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV).\n\nA robust criterion for \"clear resolution\" is that the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual widths.\nRequired separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 × 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nTherefore, we are looking for an energy difference that is greater than approximately 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\nWe must now compare the provided options with our calculated requirement (> 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV).\n\nThe options are:\nA) 10⁻⁸ eV\nB) 10⁻⁴ eV\nC) 10⁻¹¹ eV\nD) 10⁻⁹ eV\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV is 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is **smaller** than the required separation.\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV is 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is much **larger** than the required separation.\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much **smaller** than the required separation.\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV is 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is much **smaller** than the required separation.\n\n### Conclusion and Careful Points\n*   **Physics Principle:** All competent candidate answers correctly identified the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n*   **Calculation:** The numerical calculation of the energy widths (~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is consistent across all reasoned answers.\n*   **Resolution Condition:** The core of the problem is realizing that the energy difference must be *larger* than the uncertainty.\n*   **Magnitude Comparison:** The only option large enough to allow for clear resolution is 10⁻⁴ eV.

This is a direct application of the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. The principle is mathematically expressed as:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of the state.\n*   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor practical calculations, the minimum energy uncertainty, also known as the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy width\" (Γ), is approximated by:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n(where τ is the lifetime)\n\n### 2. Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their energy widths.

Determine the Minimum Required Energy Separation\n\nUsing the criterion from Step 2, the required energy separation must be greater than the sum of the widths:\n\nRequired Separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\nRequired Separation > (6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\nRequired Separation > (6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\nRequired Separation > **~7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\nSo, the energy difference must be larger than a value on the order of 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n### 5. Evaluate the Given Options\n\nNow, we compare the required separation with the given options in the problem statement:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This is equal to 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This value is much **larger** than the required separation of ~7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. **This is a valid energy difference.**\n*   **B) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This value is much **smaller** than the requirement.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is equal to 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is **smaller** than the requirement.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is equal to 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is **smaller** than the requirement.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Underlying Physics:** All competent candidate answers correctly identified the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as the basis for the solution.\n*   **Calculations:** The calculation for the energy widths of the states is consistent and correct across the board.\n*   **Resolution Criterion:** The conclusion holds whether one requires the separation to be greater than the largest width (~6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV) or the sum of the widths (~7.2 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n*   **Discrepancy in Candidate Answers:** The candidate answers show different final letters (A, B, C, D) for the same numerical value (10⁻⁴ eV). This indicates that the options were presented in a randomized order to different agents. The key is to rely on the physics and the calculated numerical value, then match it to the options list provided in *this* specific prompt.\n*   **Final Answer:** The only option that provides an energy separation large enough for the states to be clearly distinguished is 10⁻⁴ eV. In the context of the question's provided list, this corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis task requires us to determine which energy difference would allow two quantum states to be clearly resolved, given their lifetimes. The analysis proceeds by synthesizing the reasoning provided by the various candidate agents.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle:**\n    There is a unanimous consensus among all reasoned candidate answers. The problem is governed by the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time**. This fundamental principle of quantum mechanics states that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt or τ) cannot have a perfectly defined energy. Instead, its energy has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" (ΔE). The mathematical relationship is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    For practical calculations of this energy width (also called the natural linewidth), the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ/τ is used.\n    *   **ΔE**: Uncertainty in energy.\n    *   **τ**: Lifetime of the state.\n    *   **ħ**: The reduced Planck constant, which is approximately **6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s**.\n\n2.  **Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\":**\n    To \"clearly distinguish\" or resolve two energy levels, the difference in their central energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the energy separation is smaller than the widths, their smeared energy profiles will overlap to such an extent that they are indistinguishable. The primary limitation comes from the state with the *larger* energy width, which is the state with the *shorter* lifetime.\n    A good criterion for resolution is that the energy difference must be larger than the largest energy width. An even stricter (and safer) criterion is that the difference should be larger than the sum of both widths. Given that the answer options are orders of magnitude apart, either criterion will yield the same result.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculations:**\n    We need to calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state using their given lifetimes.\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n4.  **Determine the Minimum Required Separation:**\n    The larger of the two energy widths is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is the main factor limiting the resolution. Therefore, to clearly distinguish the two levels, their energy difference must be greater than this value.\n    Required Energy Separation > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    Now, we compare this requirement with the options provided in the question:\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is far smaller than the required 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This is equal to 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is much **larger** than the required separation.

This principle establishes a limit on the precision with which we can simultaneously know a quantum state's energy and its lifetime.

As calculated, State 1 has the shorter lifetime and therefore the larger energy width (ΔE₁ > ΔE₂).\n\n### Step 3: Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the energy separation is smaller than the widths, their energy profiles will overlap to such a degree that they are indistinguishable. The resolution is primarily limited by the state with the larger energy width.\n\nTherefore, the condition for resolution is:\n\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nA more stringent criterion sometimes used is that the separation must be greater than the sum of the widths (|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV).

If the separation between the levels is smaller than their widths, the two \"blurry\" energy profiles will overlap to such a degree that they cannot be told apart.\n\nThe resolution is limited by the state with the larger energy width, which is State 1 (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV). There are two common criteria for resolution:\n\n*   **Less Strict Criterion**: The energy separation must be larger than the largest individual width: |E₁ - E₂| > max(ΔE₁, ΔE₂) ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **Stricter Criterion**: The energy separation must be larger than the sum of the two widths: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.58 × 10⁻⁷ + 0.658 × 10⁻⁷) eV ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nFor this problem, both criteria lead to the same conclusion: the energy separation must be on the order of **10⁻⁷ eV or greater**.\n\n### 4.

Identify the Core Physical Principle\n\nThe question involves determining the distinguishability of two quantum energy levels that have finite lifetimes. The fundamental physical principle that governs this relationship is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. This principle states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt), there is an inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). The mathematical relationship is:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nFor practical calculations, the minimum energy uncertainty, also known as the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy width\" (Γ), is approximated by:\n\nΓ ≈ ħ / τ\n\nwhere:\n*   Γ is the energy width of the state.\n*   τ is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately **6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s**.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Energy Width for Each State\n\nWe need to calculate the energy width for each of the two states using their given lifetimes. A key point is that a shorter lifetime leads to a larger energy width.\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width Γ₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width Γ₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width and is the primary factor limiting the resolution.\n\n### 3. Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the energy difference between them must be significantly larger than their inherent energy widths. If the separation is smaller than the widths, the two \"smeared\" energy profiles will overlap to a degree where they are indistinguishable.\n\nA common criterion is that the energy difference, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than the sum of the individual energy widths:\n\n|E₁ - E₂| > Γ₁ + Γ₂\n|E₁ - E₂| > (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n|E₁ - E₂| > (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n|E₁ - E₂| > **7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\nTherefore, the energy difference must be larger than ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n### 4.

This is a direct application of the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. The principle is mathematically expressed as:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    For practical calculations of a state's minimum energy uncertainty (its \"natural linewidth\"), we can use the approximation:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ/τ\n    where ΔE is the energy width, τ is the lifetime of the state, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **List Given Values and Physical Constants**\n    *   Lifetime of the first state, τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n    *   Lifetime of the second state, τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n    *   The value of the reduced Planck constant is ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s. Using this value is convenient as the options are in electron-volts (eV).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Width (ΔE) for Each State**\n    The energy width is inversely proportional to the lifetime; therefore, the state with the shorter lifetime will have a larger energy uncertainty.\n    *   **For State 1:**\n        ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   **For State 2:**\n        ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n4.  **Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"**\n    For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved,\" the energy difference between them must be significantly larger than their inherent energy widths. If the separation is smaller, the energy profiles of the states will overlap so much that they become indistinguishable. The resolution is limited by the state with the larger energy width (ΔE₁), which corresponds to the shorter lifetime (τ₁).\n    A robust condition is that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the individual widths:\n    Required Separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 × 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ **7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV**.\n    Even a less strict condition (|Separation| > max(ΔE₁, ΔE₂)) requires the separation to be greater than **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options against the Requirement**\n    We need to find the option that provides an energy difference greater than ~7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. Let's examine the choices:\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value (1 × 10⁻⁴ eV = 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV) is significantly **larger** than the required separation of 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This allows for clear resolution.\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This value is smaller than the required separation.\n    *   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This value is much smaller than the required separation.\n    *   **D) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This value (1 × 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV) is smaller than the required separation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculations unanimously show that the energy separation must be on the order of 10⁻⁷ eV or greater to distinguish the two states. Of the options provided, only 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to satisfy this condition. The discrepancies in the letter choices among the candidate answers are due to a random shuffling of the options, but their underlying physical reasoning and numerical conclusions are consistent and correct.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the problem and a review of the provided candidate answers, here is a detailed breakdown of the reasoning to reach the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle\n\nThe question requires us to determine the necessary energy separation to distinguish two quantum states with finite lifetimes. This is a direct application of the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. The principle states that for a quantum state with a specific lifetime (Δt), there is an unavoidable uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). This relationship is mathematically expressed as:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nFor estimations, we can use the approximation **ΔE ≈ ħ/τ**, where:\n*   **ΔE** is the energy uncertainty, also known as the natural linewidth or energy width.\n*   **τ** is the lifetime of the state.\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant, approximately **6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s**.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Condition for Resolution\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved,\" the energy difference between them must be larger than their respective energy widths. If the separation is too small, their energy profiles (which are \"smeared out\" by their widths) will overlap so much that they become indistinguishable. The limiting factor is the state with the **shorter lifetime**, as it will have the **larger energy width**. A conservative condition for clear resolution is that the energy separation, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than the sum of the individual widths (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Energy Width for Each State\n\nWe are given the lifetimes:\n*   Lifetime of state 1: τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Lifetime of state 2: τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n\nNow we calculate the corresponding energy widths:\n\n*   **Energy width of State 1 (ΔE₁):**\n    ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **Energy width of State 2 (ΔE₂):**\n    ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Minimum Required Energy Separation\n\nThe required separation for clear resolution must be greater than the sum of the widths:\nRequired Separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\nRequired Separation > (6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\nRequired Separation > 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nTherefore, to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, their energy difference must be significantly greater than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options\n\nWe must compare the given options with this requirement:\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV**: This is equal to 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is much **larger** than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV, so this separation is sufficient.\n*   **B) 10⁻¹¹ eV**: This is much **smaller** than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁸ eV**: This is 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is **smaller** than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁹ eV**: This is 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is **smaller** than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy separation that is orders of magnitude larger than the combined energy widths, guaranteeing that the two levels can be clearly resolved. The other options represent energy differences that are smaller than the natural width of the states, making resolution impossible.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
