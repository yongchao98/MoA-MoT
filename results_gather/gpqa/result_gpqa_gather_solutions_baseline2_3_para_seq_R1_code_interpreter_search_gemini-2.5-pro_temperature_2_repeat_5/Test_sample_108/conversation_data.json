Assuming the emitted particle X is spin-0 (a standard assumption for mesons like pions in such problems), its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum, `l_X`. To conserve angular momentum, the final total angular momentum must also be 0. This means the final NN state's angular momentum `J_f` and the particle's `l_X` must be able to couple to zero, which requires their magnitudes to be equal.\n    *   **Rule 1: `J_f = l_X`**\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The initial parity `P_i` is +1. The final parity `P_f` must also be +1. `P_f` is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X_intrinsic) * P(X_orbital) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`. The conservation equation `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}` holds only if the exponent is even.\n    *   **Rule 2: `L_f + l_X` must be odd.**\n\n3.  **Pauli Statistics Constraint (Explicitly Given):** The problem provides a specific constraint for the final `T_f=0` NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Substituting `T_f = 0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This holds only if the term `S_f + L_f + 1` is even.\n    *   **Rule 3: `S_f + L_f` must be odd.**\n\n4.  **Physical Possibility of the NN State (Implicit Rule):** Nucleons are spin-1/2 fermions. A system of two nucleons can only have a total spin of `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any other total spin value is physically impossible.\n    *   **Rule 4: `S_f` must be 0 or 1.**\n\n### Step 2: Systematically Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now apply these four rules to each option from the original question. A reaction is forbidden if it fails even one rule.\n\n| Option | Reaction | (`S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`) + `l_X` | Rule 1? `J_f=l_X` | Rule 2? `L_f+l_X` odd | Rule 3? `S_f+L_f` odd | Rule 4? `S_f` is 0/1 | **Result** |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| A) | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p` | (1, 0, 1) + 1 | `1=1` ✔️ | `0+1=1` ✔️ | `1+0=1` ✔️ | S=1 ✔️ | **Permitted** |\n| B) | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f` | (1, 2, 3) + 3 | `3=3` ✔️ | `2+3=5` ✔️ | `1+2=3` ✔️ | S=1 ✔️ | **Permitted** |\n| C) | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` | (1, 1, 0) + 0 | `0=0` ✔️ | `1+0=1` ✔️ | `1+1=2` ❌ | S=1 ✔️ | **Not Permitted** |\n| D) | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p` | (3, 2, 1) + 1 | `1=1` ✔️ | `2+1=3` ✔️ | `3+2=5` ✔️ | S=3 ❌ | **Not Permitted** |\n\n### Step 3: Analysis and Final Decision\n\nThe analysis reveals that two of the reactions are not permitted, a crucial point of understanding.\n\n*   **Option C (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`) is not permitted.** It violates **Rule 3**, the Pauli statistics constraint that was explicitly provided in the problem for a final state with `T(NN)=0`. The physically possible final state (`3P0`) is allowed to exist, but this specific *process* leading to it as a `T=0` state is forbidden.\n\n*   **Option D (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`) is not permitted.** It violates **Rule 4**, the fundamental principle that two nucleons cannot form a total spin of `S=3`. The *process* itself formally obeys the transition rules (1, 2, and 3), but it leads to a *product* that is physically impossible.\n\n**Which one is the intended answer?** The question asks to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the provided Pauli rule. Option C is the one that is invalidated directly by applying these specific rules for the transition process. The issue with Option D is a more fundamental error concerning the very existence of the final state, which is a piece of knowledge separate from the specific decay dynamics mentioned in the prompt. Therefore, the answer that best demonstrates the application of the problem's stated rules is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must analyze each proposed reaction against a set of rules derived from conservation laws and the specific constraints provided in the problem.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Governing Rules\n\n*   **Initial State (`1S0`)**: The initial two-nucleon (NN) system has the following quantum numbers, derived from the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n    *   Total Spin: `S_i = 0`\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum: `L_i = 0`\n    *   Total Angular Momentum: `J_i = 0`\n    *   Parity: `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`\n\n*   **Reaction and Final State**: The reaction is `NN(1S0) -> NN_f + X`, where `NN_f` has quantum numbers `S_f, L_f, J_f` and isospin `T_f = 0`. Particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` and orbital angular momentum `l_X`.\n\n*   **Selection Rules**: A transition is allowed only if it satisfies all of the following rules:\n    1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**: The initial total angular momentum `J_i` is 0. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of `J_f` and `l_X` (assuming particle X is spinless). For the sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal.\n        *   **Condition: `J_f = l_X`**\n    2.  **Conservation of Parity**: The initial parity `P_i = +1` must equal the final parity `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_{int} * P(X)_{orb} = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`. For `P_i = P_f`, it is required that `L_f + l_X` is an **odd** number.\n        *   **Condition: `L_f + l_X` is odd.**\n    3.  **Pauli Statistics Constraint**: The problem provides the rule `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. For the specified `T_f = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`, which requires that `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n        *   **Condition: `S_f + L_f` is odd.**\n    4.  **Physical Possibility of NN States**: A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 fermions) can only have a total spin of `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any other spin value is physically impossible.\n\n### 2. Systematic Evaluation of Options\n\nWe now test each reaction against these four rules.\n\n| Option | Reaction            | Decoded Final State: `(S_f, L_f, J_f) + l_X` | Ang. Mom. `J_f = l_X`? | Parity `L_f+l_X` odd? | Pauli `S_f+L_f` odd? | Physical State `S_f=0,1`? | Verdict           |\n| :----: | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------- | :---------------------- | :-------------------- | :-------------------- | :--------------------------- | :---------------- |\n| **A)** | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`    | (3, 2, 1) + 1                                | `1=1` (✔️)               | `2+1=3` (✔️)           | `3+2=5` (✔️)           | `S=3` (❌)                    | **Not Permitted** |\n| **B)** | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`    | (1, 1, 0) + 0                                | `0=0` (✔️)               | `1+0=1` (✔️)           | `1+1=2` (❌)            | `S=1` (✔️)                    | **Not Permitted** |\n| **C)** | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`    | (1, 0, 1) + 1                                | `1=1` (✔️)               | `0+1=1` (✔️)           | `1+0=1` (✔️)           | `S=1` (✔️)                    | Permitted         |\n| **D)** | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`    | (1, 2, 3) + 3                                | `3=3` (✔️)               | `2+3=5` (✔️)           | `1+2=3` (✔️)           | `S=1` (✔️)                    | Permitted         |\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nOur analysis identifies two non-permitted reactions:\n*   **A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**: This reaction is forbidden because the final state `7D1` requires the two nucleons to form a spin `S=3` state, which is physically impossible.\n*   **B) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**: This reaction is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics constraint given in the problem. The final state `3P0` has `S_f = 1` and `L_f = 1`, making their sum `S_f + L_f = 2` (even). For a `T=0` state, this sum must be odd.\n\nSince the question asks for a single forbidden partial wave, we must discern the intended answer. The question specifically directs us to use the rules of conservation and the given Pauli statistics constraint. Option **B** is forbidden precisely because it fails one of these explicit rules governing the *transition dynamics*. The problem with Option **A** lies in the physical *existence* of the final state, which is a different type of violation. In physics problems designed to test selection rules, the intended answer is the one that violates the specific rules provided for the process.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Problem and State Analysis\n\nFirst, we analyze the quantum numbers of the initial state and establish the rules that govern the reaction.\n\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. The spectroscopic notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n    *   **Total Spin `S_i`:** From `2S_i + 1 = 1`, we get `S_i = 0`.\n    *   **Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i`:** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n    *   **Total Angular Momentum `J_i`:** The subscript is '0', so `J_i = 0`.\n    *   **Parity `P_i`:** Parity is given by `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has an isospin of `T(NN)_f = 0`.\n\n### 2. Establishing the Selection Rules\n\nA reaction is permitted only if it satisfies all of the following physical principles:\n\n1.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final State:** The problem explicitly provides a constraint for the final state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   For the given `T_f = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation requires `S_f + L_f + 1` to be an even number, which means the sum **`S_f + L_f` must be odd**.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity must be the same before and after the reaction (`P_i = P_f`).\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X_intrinsic) * P(X_orbital) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   For `P_i = P_f`, we need `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n    *   This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be even, meaning **`L_f + l_X` must be odd**.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum must be conserved (`J_i = J_f`).\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of `J_f` (from the final NN state) and `l_X` (assuming the emitted particle is spinless).\n    *   For the sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal: **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n4.  **Physicality of States:** Two nucleons are spin-1/2 fermions. Their total spin can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any other spin value is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of Options\n\nWe now test each proposed reaction against these four rules.\n\n| Option | Reaction | Decoded State `(S_f, L_f, J_f)` + `l_X` | Pauli (`S_f+L_f` odd)? | Parity (`L_f+l_X` odd)? | Ang. Mom. (`J_f=l_X`)? | Physical `S_f`? | Permitted? |\n| :---: | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **A** | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` | `S=1, L=1, J=0` + `l=0` | `1+1=2` (Even) **❌** | `1+0=1` (Odd) ✔️ | `0=0` ✔️ | `S=1` ✔️ | **No** |\n| **B** | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p` | `S=3, L=2, J=1` + `l=1` | `3+2=5` (Odd) ✔️ | `2+1=3` (Odd) ✔️ | `1=1` ✔️ | `S=3` **❌** | **No** |\n| **C** | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p` | `S=1, L=0, J=1` + `l=1` | `1+0=1` (Odd) ✔️ | `0+1=1` (Odd) ✔️ | `1=1` ✔️ | `S=1` ✔️ | Yes |\n| **D** | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f` | `S=1, L=2, J=3` + `l=3` | `1+2=3` (Odd) ✔️ | `2+3=5` (Odd) ✔️ | `3=3` ✔️ | `S=1` ✔️ | Yes |\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis reveals that two of the reactions are not permitted:\n\n*   **Option A (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)**: This reaction is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics rule explicitly provided in the problem for a final `T=0` state (`S_f + L_f` must be odd, but `1+1=2` is even).\n\n*   **Option B (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)**: This reaction is forbidden because the final state `7D1` requires the two-nucleon system to have a total spin of `S=3`. This is physically impossible for a system of two spin-1/2 particles.\n\nSince a multiple-choice question should have a single best answer, we must determine the intended answer. The question specifically instructs the user to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the provided \"Pauli statistics\" rule. Option A is forbidden because it fails one of these specified rules governing the *process* of the reaction. Option B is forbidden for a more fundamental reason related to the *existence* of the final state, which relies on implicit knowledge about spin addition that is not part of the explicit rules to check. Therefore, the violation the question is designed to test is the one in Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the proposed reactions is forbidden by the laws of physics. We will systematically analyze each option by checking it against the principles of conservation of angular momentum and parity, as well as the specific Pauli statistics constraint provided in the problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Problem and Establish Selection Rules\n\nFirst, let's identify the properties of the initial state and the rules that any permitted reaction must follow.\n\n*   **Initial State (`1S0`)**: The initial two-nucleon (NN) system has the following quantum numbers, derived from the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n    *   Initial total spin `S_i = 0` (since `2S+1=1`).\n    *   Initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0` (from the letter 'S').\n    *   Initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0` (from the subscript '0').\n    *   The initial parity is `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Final State (`NN_f + X`)**: The final state consists of a two-nucleon system and an emitted particle `X`. The following rules must govern this transition:\n\n    *   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (`J`)**:\n        The initial `J_i` is 0, so the final total angular momentum must also be 0. The final angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN system's `J_f` and the particle X's orbital angular momentum `l_X` (assuming X is a spin-0 particle, a standard convention in such problems). For the vector sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal:\n        `J_f = l_X`\n\n    *   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity (`P`)**:\n        The initial parity (`+1`) must equal the final parity. The final parity is the product of its components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_{intrinsic} * P(X)_{orbital} = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`. For `P_i = P_f`, we need `+1 = -(-1)^{L_f + l_X}`. This requires the exponent of the main term to be odd, meaning:\n        `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n    *   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics (as given for the `T=0` final state)**:\n        The problem states `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Given the final state has `T(NN)=0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This equation only holds if `S_f + L_f` is an **odd** number.\n\n    *   **Rule 4: Physicality of the NN State (an implicit rule)**:\n        A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 fermions) can only have a total spin of `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). A state requiring any other spin value is physically impossible.\n\n### 2. Systematic Evaluation of Options\n\nWe will now apply these four rules to each of the proposed reactions. A reaction is forbidden if it violates even one rule.\n\n| Option | Reaction | Final NN State (`S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`) | `l_X` | Rule 1: `J_f = l_X`? | Rule 2: `L_f+l_X` odd? | Rule 3: `S_f+L_f` odd? | Rule 4: Valid `S_f`? | Conclusion |\n|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| A) | 1S0 -> 7D1 + p | `S=3`, `L=2`, `J=1` | 1 | 1 = 1 (OK) | 2+1 = 3 (OK) | 3+2 = 5 (OK) | `S=3` **(FAIL)** | **Forbidden** |\n| B) | 1S0 -> 3S1 + p | `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1` | 1 | 1 = 1 (OK) | 0+1 = 1 (OK) | 1+0 = 1 (OK) | `S=1` (OK) | **Permitted** |\n| C) | 1S0 -> 3D3 + f | `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3` | 3 | 3 = 3 (OK) | 2+3 = 5 (OK) | 1+2 = 3 (OK) | `S=1` (OK) | **Permitted** |\n| D) | 1S0 -> 3P0 + s | `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0` | 0 | 0 = 0 (OK) | 1+0 = 1 (OK) | 1+1 = 2 **(FAIL)** | `S=1` (OK) | **Forbidden** |\n\n### 3. Final Analysis and Decision\n\nOur analysis reveals two forbidden reactions for different reasons:\n*   **Option A** is forbidden because the final `7D1` state is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system (Rule 4). It requires a total spin `S=3`, but two spin-1/2 particles can only combine to form `S=0` or `S=1`.\n*   **Option D** is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics constraint (Rule 3) that was explicitly provided for the final `T=0` state. For the `3P0` state, `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is even. The rule requires this sum to be odd.\n\nThe question asks us to identify the forbidden partial wave by making use of the specified rules: conservation laws and the Pauli constraint. Option D fails one of these specific rules that govern the *process* of the transition. The failure in Option A is due to the *existence* of the final state itself, a more fundamental violation but one that is outside the explicit list of transition rules to check. In this context, the intended answer is the one that violates the selection rules given for the process.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a synthesis of the provided solutions.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Problem and Physical Principles\n\nFirst, we need to extract the quantum numbers of the initial state and establish the set of rules that govern the nuclear reaction.\n\n*   **Initial State (`1S0`):**\n    *   Using the spectroscopic notation `(2S+1)L(J)`, for the initial state (`i`) we have:\n        *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` → Initial Spin `S_i = 0`.\n        *   `L = S` → Initial Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0`.\n        *   `J = 0` → Initial Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The initial parity is `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Reaction and Final State:**\n    *   The reaction is `NN(1S0) → NN_f + X`.\n    *   Particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The final two-nucleon state `NN_f` is specified to have isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\n### 2. Establishing the Selection Rules\n\nFor a reaction to be \"permitted\", it must satisfy all relevant physical laws. The key rules are:\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (`J`)**\n    *   The initial total angular momentum `J_i` is 0. For the final total angular momentum to be 0, the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`) must be coupled to zero (assuming X is a spinless particle). This requires their magnitudes to be equal.\n    *   **Condition: `J_f = l_X`**.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity (`P`)**\n    *   Initial parity `P_i` is +1. Final parity `P_f` must also be +1.\n    *   `P_f = P(NN_f) × P(X)_intrinsic × P(X)_orbital = (-1)^{L_f} × (-1) × (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n    *   For `P_f = +1`, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be even.\n    *   **Condition: `L_f + l_X` must be odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics (Specific Rule for `T=0`)**\n    *   The problem provides the constraint `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   For the specified final state with `T_f = 0`, the equation becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   **Condition: `S_f + L_f` must be odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physical Possibility of States (Implicit Knowledge)**\n    *   A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 fermions. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any other value is physically impossible.\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of Options\n\nWe now apply these four rules to each option presented in the question. A reaction is not permitted if it fails even one rule.\n\n| Option | Reaction | Decoded Quantum Numbers `(S_f, L_f, J_f)` + `l_X` | J Cons? (`J_f=l_X`) | Parity Cons? (`L_f+l_X` odd) | Pauli Rule? (`S_f+L_f` odd) | State Physical? (`S_f=0` or `1`) | Status |\n| :----: | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| A) | 1S0 -> 7D1 + p | (3, 2, 1) + 1 | 1=1 (✔️) | 2+1=3 (✔️) | 3+2=5 (✔️) | S=3 (**❌**) | **Forbidden** |\n| B) | 1S0 -> 3S1 + p | (1, 0, 1) + 1 | 1=1 (✔️) | 0+1=1 (✔️) | 1+0=1 (✔️) | S=1 (✔️) | Permitted |\n| C) | 1S0 -> 3D3 + f | (1, 2, 3) + 3 | 3=3 (✔️) | 2+3=5 (✔️) | 1+2=3 (✔️) | S=1 (✔️) | Permitted |\n| D) | 1S0 -> 3P0 + s | (1, 1, 0) + 0 | 0=0 (✔️) | 1+0=1 (✔️) | 1+1=2 (**❌**) | S=1 (✔️) | **Forbidden** |\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nOur analysis identifies two forbidden reactions:\n\n*   **Option A (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` requires the two-nucleon system to have a total spin of `S=3`. This is physically impossible for a system of two nucleons.\n*   **Option D (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)** is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics constraint (Rule 3) that was provided in the problem for a final state with `T=0`. The sum `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is even, but the rule requires it to be odd.\n\nSince the question asks for a single answer, we must determine which violation is the intended focus. The problem explicitly directs us to \"make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the provided \"Pauli statistics\" rule. Option D is forbidden *precisely* because it violates one of these stated rules governing the reaction process. The issue with Option A is the non-existence of the final product, which is a more fundamental constraint not explicitly enumerated in the problem's list of rules for the transition. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that directly fails the specific test of the interaction dynamics described.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to consolidate the reasoning from the candidate answers and arrive at the definitive correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Problem Statement\n\nFirst, we establish the quantum numbers of the initial state and the rules governing the reaction.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system is a two-nucleon (NN) bound system in a **¹S₀** state. Using the term symbol notation `(2S+1)L(J)`, we find:\n    *   Initial Total Spin (`Sᵢ`): `2Sᵢ + 1 = 1`  →  `Sᵢ = 0`.\n    *   Initial Orbital Angular Momentum (`Lᵢ`): The letter 'S' denotes `Lᵢ = 0`.\n    *   Initial Total Angular Momentum (`Jᵢ`): The subscript '0' means `Jᵢ = 0`.\n    *   Initial Parity (`Pᵢ`): Parity is given by `(-1)ᴸ`, so `Pᵢ = (-1)⁰ = +1`.\n\n*   **Reaction Rules:** The system decays via `NN(initial) → NN(final) + X`. We must test the proposed final states against a set of rules.\n    1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** Since `Jᵢ = 0`, the total angular momentum of the final state must also be 0. This is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and particle X's angular momentum. Assuming X is spinless (standard in such problems), its angular momentum is its orbital angular momentum `l_X`. For the sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n    2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The initial parity (`+1`) must equal the final parity. The final parity `P_f` is the product of the parity of the final NN system (`(-1) ^ L_f`), the intrinsic parity of X (`-1`), and the parity of the orbital motion of X (`(-1) ^ l_X`).\n        *   `P_f = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n        *   For `P_i = P_f`, we need `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`. This requires the exponent to be even, meaning **`L_f + l_X` must be odd**.\n    3.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final State:** The problem gives a specific rule for the final `T_f = 0` NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n        *   Substituting `T_f = 0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n        *   This equation requires `S_f + L_f + 1` to be an even number. Therefore, **`S_f + L_f` must be odd**.\n    4.  **Physical Possibility of States:** Two nucleons are spin-½ particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet, `2S+1=1`) or `S=1` (triplet, `2S+1=3`). A state with any other spin value is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Option Systematically\n\nWe now test each reaction from the original question prompt against these four rules.\n\n*   **A) ¹S₀ → ³S₁ + p**\n    *   Final NN state (`³S₁`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`. Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n    *   1. J Cons: `J_f = l_X`? → `1=1`. (Pass)\n    *   2. P Cons: `L_f+l_X` odd? → `0+1=1`. (Pass)\n    *   3. Pauli: `S_f+L_f` odd? → `1+0=1`. (Pass)\n    *   4. Physicality: `S_f=1`? (Pass)\n    *   **Verdict: Permitted**\n\n*   **B) ¹S₀ → ³D₃ + f**\n    *   Final NN state (`³D₃`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`. Particle X (`f`): `l_X=3`.\n    *   1. J Cons: `J_f = l_X`? → `3=3`. (Pass)\n    *   2. P Cons: `L_f+l_X` odd? → `2+3=5`. (Pass)\n    *   3. Pauli: `S_f+L_f` odd? → `1+2=3`. (Pass)\n    *   4. Physicality: `S_f=1`? (Pass)\n    *   **Verdict: Permitted**\n\n*   **C) ¹S₀ → ³P₀ + s**\n    *   Final NN state (`³P₀`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`. Particle X (`s`): `l_X=0`.\n    *   1. J Cons: `J_f = l_X`? → `0=0`. (Pass)\n    *   2. P Cons: `L_f+l_X` odd? → `1+0=1`. (Pass)\n    *   3. Pauli: `S_f+L_f` odd? → `1+1=2`. This is **even**, violating the rule. **(Fail)**\n    *   4. Physicality: `S_f=1`? (Pass)\n    *   **Verdict: Not Permitted**\n\n*   **D) ¹S₀ → ⁷D₁ + p**\n    *   Final NN state (`⁷D₁`): `2S_f+1=7` → `S_f=3`.\n    *   4. Physicality: `S_f=3`? This is **impossible** for a two-nucleon system. **(Fail)**\n    *   (Even though the reaction is already forbidden, we note it passes rules 1, 2, and 3.)\n    *   **Verdict: Not Permitted**\n\n### 3. Conclusion and Final Answer\n\nThe analysis reveals two forbidden reactions: C and D.\n*   **Reaction D is forbidden** because the proposed final state, `⁷D₁`, is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. The violation is in the existence of the product itself.\n*   **Reaction C is forbidden** because it violates a specific selection rule for the *transition*, namely the Pauli statistics constraint (`S_f + L_f` must be odd) that was explicitly stated in the problem for a final `T_f=0` state.\n\nThe question explicitly asks to \"make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the provided \"Pauli statistics\" rule. Reaction C is the one that is disallowed specifically by these rules of the process. The issue with Reaction D is more fundamental and lies outside the specific transition rules enumerated in the prompt. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that fails the selection rule test.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the forbidden partial wave from the given options.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Initial State and Governing Rules\n\nFirst, we establish the quantum numbers of the initial state and the selection rules that govern the reaction.\n\n*   **Initial State**: The two-nucleon (NN) system is in a `1S0` state. Using the term symbol notation `(2S+1)L(J)`, we find:\n    *   **Initial Spin (`S_i`)**: `2S_i + 1 = 1` → `S_i = 0`\n    *   **Initial Orbital Angular Momentum (`L_i`)**: The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n    *   **Initial Total Angular Momentum (`J_i`)**: The subscript is '0', so `J_i = 0`.\n    *   **Initial Parity (`P_i`)**: Parity is given by `(-1)^L`. Therefore, `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Reaction**: `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`. The particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. The final NN state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n\n*   **Selection Rules**: A transition is permitted only if it satisfies all of the following conditions:\n\n    1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (`J`)**: The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of `J_f` (from the final NN state) and `l_X` (the orbital angular momentum of particle X, assuming it is spinless). For the total to remain zero, their magnitudes must be equal: **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n    2.  **Conservation of Parity (`P`)**: The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity (`P_f`). `P_f` is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_{intrinsic} * P(X)_{orbital}`. So, `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`. This simplifies to requiring that `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n    3.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final State**: The problem provides a specific constraint for the final `T_f=0` NN state: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. Substituting `T_f = 0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This requires `S_f + L_f` to be an **odd** number.\n\n    4.  **Physicality of the Final State**: A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 fermions. Their total spin can only be `S=0` (singlet state, `2S+1=1`) or `S=1` (triplet state, `2S+1=3`). A state with any other spin, such as `S=3` (multiplicity `2S+1=7`), is physically impossible.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will test each proposed partial wave against these four rules.\n\n| Option | Reaction | Decoded State `(S_f, L_f, J_f)` + `l_X` | `J_f = l_X`? (Rule 1) | `L_f + l_X` odd? (Rule 2) | `S_f + L_f` odd? (Rule 3) | `S_f=0` or `1`? (Rule 4) | Verdict |\n|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| **A)** | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` | (1, 1, 0) + 0 | `0=0` (✔️) | `1+0=1` (✔️) | `1+1=2` (❌) | `S=1` (✔️) | **Not Permitted** |\n| **B)** | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f` | (1, 2, 3) + 3 | `3=3` (✔️) | `2+3=5` (✔️) | `1+2=3` (✔️) | `S=1` (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n| **C)** | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p` | (3, 2, 1) + 1 | `1=1` (✔️) | `2+1=3` (✔️) | `3+2=5` (✔️) | `S=3` (❌) | **Not Permitted** |\n| **D)** | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p` | (1, 0, 1) + 1 | `1=1` (✔️) | `0+1=1` (✔️) | `1+0=1` (✔️) | `S=1` (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nOur analysis shows that two reactions, A and C, are not permitted.\n*   **Reaction A (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)** is not permitted because it violates the Pauli statistics constraint (Rule 3) explicitly given in the problem for a final `T=0` state. For the `3P0` state, `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is even, but the rule requires an odd sum.\n*   **Reaction C (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)** is not permitted because the final NN state `7D1` requires a total spin `S=3`, which is physically impossible for a system of two nucleons (Rule 4).\n\nThe question asks for the single non-permitted partial wave and instructs us to \"make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the provided \"Pauli statistics\". Reaction A is the one forbidden by these explicit rules governing the *process* of the transition. Reaction C is forbidden for a more fundamental reason related to the *existence* of the final state itself. In the context of such physics problems, the intended answer is the one that directly fails the stated selection rules for the transition.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers and a first-principles approach.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Problem and Establish Selection Rules\n\nFirst, let's distill the physical principles and constraints from the problem description.\n\n**Initial State**: The system starts as two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n*   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives the quantum numbers for the initial state (`i`):\n    *   **Initial Spin (`S_i`)**: `2S_i + 1 = 1` → `S_i = 0`.\n    *   **Initial Orbital Angular Momentum (`L_i`)**: The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n    *   **Initial Total Angular Momentum (`J_i`)**: The subscript is '0', so `J_i = 0`.\n    *   **Initial Parity (`P_i`)**: Parity is `(-1)^L`, so `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**The Reaction**: `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`\n*   Particle `X` has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`.\n*   The final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\n**The Rules of the Game (Selection Rules)**:\nFor a reaction to be \"permitted\", it must satisfy all of the following rules. A reaction that violates any of them is \"not permitted\" or \"forbidden\".\n\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (`J`)**:\n    *   The initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum (the vector sum of the final NN system's `J_f` and the particle X's orbital momentum `l_X`) must also be zero. This requires that their magnitudes be equal.\n    *   **Rule:** `J_f = l_X`\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (`P`)**:\n    *   The initial parity `P_i = +1`. The final parity must also be `+1`.\n    *   The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X_intrinsic) * P(X_orbital) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   For `P_f` to equal `+1`, the exponent in `(-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}` must be even.\n    *   **Rule:** `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n3.  **Pauli Statistics Constraint**:\n    *   The problem explicitly states a rule for the final state: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Since the final state must have `T_f = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This requires the sum `S_f + L_f + 1` to be an even number.\n    *   **Rule:** `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n4.  **Physicality of the Final State**:\n    *   A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. By the rules of angular momentum addition, their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet state) or `S=1` (triplet state).\n    *   **Rule:** `S_f` must be either 0 or 1.\n\n### 2. Systematic Evaluation of Options\n\nLet's apply these four rules to each option given in the question.\n\n| Option | Reaction | Final NN State (`S_f, L_f, J_f`) | X (`l_X`) | Rule 1 `J_f=l_X`? | Rule 2 `L_f+l_X` odd? | Rule 3 `S_f+L_f` odd? | Rule 4 `S_f=0,1`? | Verdict |\n| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |\n| **A** | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f` | S=1, L=2, J=3 | 3 | `3=3` (✔️) | `2+3=5` (✔️) | `1+2=3` (✔️) | `S=1` (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n| **B** | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p` | S=3, L=2, J=1 | 1 | `1=1` (✔️) | `2+1=3` (✔️) | `3+2=5` (✔️) | `S=3` (**❌**) | **Not Permitted** |\n| **C** | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` | S=1, L=1, J=0 | 0 | `0=0` (✔️) | `1+0=1` (✔️) | `1+1=2` (**❌**) | `S=1` (✔️) | **Not Permitted** |\n| **D** | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p` | S=1, L=0, J=1 | 1 | `1=1` (✔️) | `0+1=1` (✔️) | `1+0=1` (✔️) | `S=1` (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n\n### 3. Conclusion and Final Answer\n\nThe analysis reveals two \"not permitted\" reactions:\n\n*   **Option B (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)** is forbidden because the final NN state `7D1` requires a total spin `S=3` (since `2S+1=7`). This is physically impossible for a system of two spin-1/2 nucleons.\n*   **Option C (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)** is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics rule explicitly given in the problem for a final state with `T_f=0`. For this final state, `S_f=1` and `L_f=1`, so their sum `S_f+L_f = 2` is even. The rule requires this sum to be odd.\n\nSince the question asks for a single forbidden partial wave, we must discern the intended answer. The prompt asks us to make use of specific rules: conservation laws and the Pauli statistics requirement.\n*   Option C is forbidden precisely because it violates one of these explicit rules governing the *process* of the reaction.\n*   Option B is forbidden for a more fundamental reason concerning the *existence* of the final product state, a condition that is implicit but not part of the explicit list of rules given for the transition.\n\nIn physics problems of this nature, the intended answer is the one that directly fails the specific selection rules provided for the scenario. Therefore, `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the forbidden partial wave the question is designed to identify.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Initial State and Selection Rules\n\nFirst, we establish the properties of the initial state and the rules that any valid transition must follow, based on the problem statement.\n\n*   **Initial State (`1S0`):** The initial two-nucleon (NN) system has quantum numbers derived from the `(2S+1)L(J)` term symbol notation:\n    *   Initial Total Spin: `S_i = 0` (from `2S+1=1`)\n    *   Initial Orbital Angular Momentum: `L_i = 0` (from the letter 'S')\n    *   Initial Total Angular Momentum: `J_i = 0` (from the subscript '0')\n    *   Initial Parity: `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`\n\n*   **Selection Rules for the Reaction `1S0 -> NN_f + X`:**\n    A transition is permitted only if it satisfies all of the following rules:\n\n    1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:** The initial total angular momentum `J_i` is 0. For the final total angular momentum to also be 0, the angular momenta of the final products (`J_f` for the NN system and `l_X` for particle X, assuming X is spinless) must couple to zero. This requires their magnitudes to be equal:\n        `J_f = l_X`\n\n    2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity (`P_f`). `P_f` is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_{intrinsic} * P(X)_{orbital} = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`. For parity to be conserved, `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`, which requires that the sum:\n        `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n    3.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final State:** The problem gives a specific rule for the final state with isospin `T(NN) = 0`: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Substituting `T(NN)=0` gives `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`, which requires that the sum:\n        `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n\n    4.  **Physicality of States (Implicit Rule):** A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any other spin value is physically impossible for the final `NN_f` state.\n\n### 2. Systematic Evaluation of Options\n\nWe now test each proposed reaction against these four rules.\n\n*   **A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n    *   `NN_f = 3D3` means `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.

Particle X is in an `s` wave, so `l_X=0`.\n    *   Rule 3 (`S_f+L_f` odd): `1+1 = 2` (even). **This violates the Pauli statistics rule.**\n    *   Let's check other rules: `J_f=l_X` -> `0=0` (Pass), `L_f+l_X` odd -> `1+0=1` (Pass), Physicality -> `S_f=1` (Pass).\n    *   **Conclusion: Not Permitted.** The reaction is forbidden because it violates one of the explicit transition rules given in the problem.\n\n*   **D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n    *   `NN_f = 3S1` means `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.

Final Decision\n\nBoth options B and C represent forbidden reactions, but for different reasons.\n*   **Option B** is forbidden because the proposed final product (`7D1` state) is unphysical and cannot exist for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **Option C** is forbidden because the transition to the specified `T=0` final state violates the Pauli statistics rule explicitly provided in the question.\n\nThe question asks us to identify the non-permitted partial wave by making use of the conservation laws and the *given* Pauli rule. Option C is the choice that is invalidated by a direct application of these specific transition rules. The issue with Option B is a more fundamental one concerning the existence of the final state, which is prerequisite knowledge not part of the decay dynamics themselves. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that directly fails the test laid out in the problem statement.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Problem and Establish the Selection Rules\n\nFirst, we must break down the problem into its components and identify the physical rules that govern the reaction.\n\n*   **Initial State**: The system is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. From the spectroscopic notation `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can determine the initial quantum numbers:\n    *   `S_i = 0` (initial total spin, from `2S+1=1`)\n    *   `L_i = 0` (initial orbital angular momentum, from the letter 'S')\n    *   `J_i = 0` (initial total angular momentum, from the subscript '0')\n    *   The initial parity is `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Reaction**: `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`. The problem requires us to evaluate several proposed final states.\n\nWe must check each proposal against a set of rules. A reaction is forbidden if it violates any of them.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**. The initial total angular momentum `J_i` is 0. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`). For the final sum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal: **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity (P)**. The initial parity `P_i` is +1. The final parity `P_f` is the product of the parities of the final state components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_{intrinsic} * P(X)_{orbital} = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`. For parity to be conserved (`P_i = P_f`), we must have `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`. This requires the exponent to be an even number, which means the sum **`L_f + l_X` must be odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics Condition**. The problem gives a specific condition derived from the Pauli exclusion principle for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Since we are told the final state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`, the condition becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This equation holds only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number, which means the sum **`S_f + L_f` must be odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physical Possibility of the NN State**. Two nucleons are spin-1/2 particles. According to the rules of angular momentum addition, their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any other value, such as `S=3` (septet), is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\n### 2. Systematic Evaluation of Options\n\nWe now apply these four rules to each option provided in the question.\n\n| Option | Reaction | Decoded State `(S_f, L_f, J_f) + l_X` | `J_f=l_X`? | `L_f+l_X` odd? | `S_f+L_f` odd? | `S_f=0` or `1`? | Verdict |\n|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|\n| A) | 1S0 -> 3D3 + f | (1, 2, 3) + 3 | 3 = 3 (✔️) | 2+3=5 (✔️) | 1+2=3 (✔️) | S=1 (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n| B) | 1S0 -> 3P0 + s | (1, 1, 0) + 0 | 0 = 0 (✔️) | 1+0=1 (✔️) | 1+1=2 (**❌**) | S=1 (✔️) | **Not Permitted** |\n| C) | 1S0 -> 7D1 + p | (3, 2, 1) + 1 | 1 = 1 (✔️) | 2+1=3 (✔️) | 3+2=5 (✔️) | S=3 (**❌**) | **Not Permitted** |\n| D) | 1S0 -> 3S1 + p | (1, 0, 1) + 1 | 1 = 1 (✔️) | 0+1=1 (✔️) | 1+0=1 (✔️) | S=1 (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nOur analysis identifies two partial waves that are not permitted:\n\n*   **B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**: This reaction is forbidden because it violates **Rule 3**, the specific Pauli statistics constraint provided in the problem. The sum `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is an even number, but the rule requires it to be odd for a `T=0` final state.\n*   **C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**: This reaction is forbidden because it violates **Rule 4**. The final NN state `7D1` requires a total spin `S_f=3`, which is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\nThe question asks for a single forbidden partial wave. When presented with two forbidden options for different reasons, we must interpret the question's intent. The problem explicitly instructs us to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the provided \"Pauli statistics\" rule. Option B is forbidden precisely because it violates one of these explicit rules of the *transition*. Option C is forbidden for a more fundamental reason about the *existence* of the final state itself. In the context of such physics problems, the intended answer is the one that directly fails the provided selection rule test.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Problem and Physical Principles\n\nThe question asks us to identify a forbidden nuclear decay from a list of possibilities, based on a specific set of rules.\n\n**Initial State:** The system is two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. We can determine its quantum numbers from the term symbol notation `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   **Total Spin (`S_i`):** `2S_i + 1 = 1` means `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (`L_i`):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (`J_i`):** The subscript '0' means `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (`P_i`):** The parity is given by `(-1)^L`. Thus, `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**Reaction:** The decay is `NN(1S0) -> NN_final + X`.\n*   Particle `X` has an intrinsic parity of `-1`.\n*   The final NN state has an isospin of `T(NN) = 0`.\n\n### 2. The Governing Selection Rules\n\nFor a reaction to be permitted, it must satisfy all relevant physical laws. The problem instructs us to use conservation laws and a given Pauli statistics rule.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`), assuming X is spinless. For the sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal.\n    **Condition: `J_f = l_X`**\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity (P)**\n    The initial parity `P_i = +1` must equal the final parity `P_f`. `P_f` is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X_intrinsic) * P(X_orbital) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`. For `P_i = P_f`, we need `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`. This is only true if the exponent is an even number.\n    **Condition: `L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.**\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\n    The problem provides the constraint `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Given the final state has `T(NN) = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This equation is only satisfied if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number.\n    **Condition: `S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.**\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physical Possibility of States**\n    Two nucleons are spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). A state with `2S+1=7` implies `S=3`, which is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of Options\n\nLet's test each option against these four rules. A reaction is \"not permitted\" if it fails even one rule.\n\n| Option | Reaction | Final State `(S_f, L_f, J_f) + l_X` | Rule 1 `J_f=l_X`? | Rule 2 `L_f+l_X` odd? | Rule 3 `S_f+L_f` odd? | Rule 4 `S_f` possible? | Verdict |\n| :---: | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **A)** | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` | `(1, 1, 0) + 0` | ✔️ | ✔️ (`1+0=1`) | ❌ (`1+1=2`) | ✔️ | **Not Permitted** |\n| **B)** | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p` | `(3, 2, 1) + 1` | ✔️ | ✔️ (`2+1=3`) | ✔️ (`3+2=5`) | ❌ (`S=3`) | **Not Permitted** |\n| **C)** | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f` | `(1, 2, 3) + 3` | ✔️ | ✔️ (`2+3=5`) | ✔️ (`1+2=3`) | ✔️ | Permitted |\n| **D)** | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p` | `(1, 0, 1) + 1` | ✔️ | ✔️ (`0+1=1`) | ✔️ (`1+0=1`) | ✔️ | Permitted |\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nWe have identified two forbidden reactions, A and B, for distinct reasons:\n*   **Option B (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)** is forbidden because the final product state (`7D1`) is physically impossible for two nucleons to form.\n*   **Option A (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)** is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics rule provided in the problem for a reaction leading to a `T=0` final state. For the `3P0` state, `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is an even number, failing Rule 3.\n\nThe question asks for the partial wave that is not permitted, implying a single answer. We must choose the most fitting answer based on the question's framing. The prompt explicitly asks us to use conservation laws and the provided Pauli rule. Option A is forbidden precisely by a direct application of these specified rules for the *transition process*. The issue with Option B is a violation of a more fundamental principle concerning the *existence of the state itself*. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that directly tests the principles enumerated in the question.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the problem and the provided reasoning.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State and the Reaction\n\nFirst, we decode the quantum numbers of the initial two-nucleon (NN) system, which is in a `1S0` state. Using the standard term symbol notation `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   **Initial Spin (`S_i`):** `2S_i + 1 = 1` gives `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Initial Orbital Angular Momentum (`L_i`):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Initial Total Angular Momentum (`J_i`):** The subscript '0' indicates `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Initial Parity (`P_i`):** The parity is `(-1)^{L_i}`, so `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\nThe reaction is `NN(1S0) -> NN_final + X`, where particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1.\n\n### 2. Establish the Selection Rules\n\nFor a reaction to be \"permitted\", it must obey all relevant physical laws. The problem guides us to use conservation of angular momentum and parity, as well as a specific Pauli statistics rule.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`). For the final sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal.\n    **Condition: `J_f = l_X`**\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity (P)**\n    The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity (`P_f`). The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_{intrinsic} * P(X)_{orbital} = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`. For `P_i = P_f`, we need `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`. This is only true if the exponent is even.\n    **Condition: `L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.**\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\n    The problem gives a specific condition for the final `T(NN) = 0` state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Substituting `T(NN)=0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This requires the term `S_f + L_f + 1` to be an even number.\n    **Condition: `S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.**\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physical Possibility of States**\n    This is an implicit rule of physics. A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 fermions) can only have a total spin `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any other spin value is physically impossible. A state like `7D1` requires `2S+1=7`, meaning `S=3`, which cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option Systematically\n\nWe test each option from the question against these four rules. A reaction is not permitted if it fails even one rule.\n\n| Option | Reaction | Final NN State (`S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`) + X(`l_X`) | **J-Cons.?** (`J_f=l_X`) | **Parity?** (`L_f+l_X` odd) | **Pauli?** (`S_f+L_f` odd) | **Physical?** (`S_f`=0,1) | Result |\n|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| A) | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` | (1, 1, 0) + s(0) | 0 = 0 (✔️) | 1+0 = 1 (✔️) | 1+1 = 2 (❌) | S=1 (✔️) | **Not Permitted** |\n| B) | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p` | (1, 0, 1) + p(1) | 1 = 1 (✔️) | 0+1 = 1 (✔️) | 1+0 = 1 (✔️) | S=1 (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n| C) | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p` | (3, 2, 1) + p(1) | 1 = 1 (✔️) | 2+1 = 3 (✔️) | 3+2 = 5 (✔️) | S=3 (❌) | **Not Permitted** |\n| D) | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f` | (1, 2, 3) + f(3) | 3 = 3 (✔️) | 2+3 = 5 (✔️) | 1+2 = 3 (✔️) | S=1 (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nOur analysis identifies two forbidden reactions:\n*   **A) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`:** This reaction is not permitted because it violates Rule 3, the explicit Pauli statistics constraint provided in the problem. For the final state to have `T=0`, `S_f+L_f` must be odd, but for `3P0`, `S_f+L_f = 1+1 = 2`, which is even.\n*   **C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`:** This reaction is not permitted because it violates Rule 4. The proposed final state `7D1` requires a total spin `S=3`, which is physically impossible for a system of two nucleons.\n\nWhen a multiple-choice question presents two incorrect options, it is essential to determine the most direct violation according to the problem's framing. The question asks the student to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the \"Pauli statistics\" rule. Option A fails precisely because of these stated rules governing the transition dynamics. Option C fails for a more fundamental reason related to the existence of the product itself, which is outside the list of transition rules to be checked. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that directly tests the application of the problem's specific constraints.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires a systematic application of several principles of nuclear physics to determine which reaction is forbidden. Let's break down the rules and apply them to each option.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Initial State and Selection Rules\n\n**Initial State (`1S0`):**\nFrom the spectroscopic notation `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can deduce the quantum numbers of the initial two-nucleon (NN) system:\n*   **Total Spin (`S_i`):** `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (`L_i`):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (`J_i`):** The subscript '0' means `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (`P_i`):** The parity is `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**Selection Rules for the Reaction `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`:**\nA reaction is permitted only if it obeys all the following rules, which are derived from the problem statement and fundamental physics.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The initial `J_i = 0`, so the final total angular momentum must also be 0. The final `J_total` is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`, assuming X is spinless). For the vector sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal.\n    *   **Rule 1: `J_f = l_X`**\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity (`P_f`).\n    *   `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_{intrinsic} * P(X)_{orbital} = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   For `P_f` to equal `+1`, we must have `(-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1} = +1`. This requires the exponent to be even.\n    *   **Rule 2: `L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.**\n\n3.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final State:** The problem explicitly provides a rule for the final state when its isospin is `T(NN) = 0`:\n    *   `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Substituting `T(NN) = 0` gives `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This requires `S_f + L_f + 1` to be an even number.\n    *   **Rule 3: `S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.**\n\n4.  **Physical Possibility of NN States:** A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 fermions) can only have a total spin of `S=0` (singlet, `2S+1=1`) or `S=1` (triplet, `2S+1=3`). Any other spin multiplicity is physically impossible.\n\n### 2. Systematic Evaluation of Options\n\nLet's test each option against these four rules. A reaction is forbidden if it violates even one rule.\n\n| Option | Reaction | Final NN State (`S_f, L_f, J_f`) + X(`l_X`) | Rule 1 `J_f=l_X`? | Rule 2 `L_f+l_X` odd? | Rule 3 `S_f+L_f` odd? | Rule 4 State Physical? | Result |\n| :---: | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| A) | 1S0 -> 3P0 + s | (1, 1, 0) + 0 | `0=0` (✔️) | `1+0=1` (✔️) | `1+1=2` (❌) | S=1 (✔️) | **Not Permitted** |\n| B) | 1S0 -> 3S1 + p | (1, 0, 1) + 1 | `1=1` (✔️) | `0+1=1` (✔️) | `1+0=1` (✔️) | S=1 (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n| C) | 1S0 -> 7D1 + p | (3, 2, 1) + 1 | `1=1` (✔️) | `2+1=3` (✔️) | `3+2=5` (✔️) | S=3 (❌) | **Not Permitted** |\n| D) | 1S0 -> 3D3 + f | (1, 2, 3) + 3 | `3=3` (✔️) | `2+3=5` (✔️) | `1+2=3` (✔️) | S=1 (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n\n### 3. Final Decision\n\nOur analysis reveals two non-permitted reactions:\n\n*   **A) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`:** This reaction is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics constraint (Rule 3) explicitly given in the problem. The final NN state has `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is even, but the rule requires an odd sum for a `T=0` state.\n*   **C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`:** This reaction is forbidden because the final NN state `7D1` (`S=3`) is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system (Rule 4).\n\nThe question asks for a single forbidden partial wave and instructs us to \"make use of\" the specified rules. The issue with reaction C is the impossibility of the final product state, which is a violation of a fundamental principle but is external to the transition rules given in the prompt. Reaction A is a transition between two physically possible states (`1S0` and `3P0`), but it is forbidden by the specific \"Pauli statistics\" rule governing the transition into the `T=0` final channel. Therefore, option A is the answer that directly demonstrates a failure to apply the provided rules.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial State and Reaction\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the initial state and the process described.\n*   **Initial State**: The system starts as a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. The spectroscopic notation `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the initial quantum numbers:\n    *   Initial total spin `S_i = 0` (from `2S+1=1`).\n    *   Initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0` (from the letter 'S').\n    *   Initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0` (from the subscript '0').\n*   **Parity**: The initial parity is given by `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Reaction**: The system decays via `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has a specified isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n\n### Step 2: Establish the Selection Rules\n\nFor a reaction to be \"permitted\", it must satisfy all relevant conservation laws and specific constraints from the problem.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**:\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`), assuming X is spinless. For the vector sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal.\n    **Rule 1: `J_f = l_X`**\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P)**:\n    The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity (`P_f`).\n    `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X_intrinsic) * P(X_orbital) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    For parity to be conserved, `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`. This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be even.\n    **Rule 2: `L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.**\n\n3.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final State**:\n    The problem provides the constraint `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. For the specified final state with `T(NN) = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This equation holds only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number.\n    **Rule 3: `S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.**\n\n4.  **Physicality of the Final State**:\n    Two nucleons are spin-1/2 fermions. Their total spin can only combine to form `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any other total spin, such as `S=3` (which would correspond to a spin multiplicity of `2S+1 = 7`), is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n    **Rule 4: The final spin `S_f` must be 0 or 1.**\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each of the four proposed reactions against these rules. A reaction is forbidden if it fails any rule.\n\n| Option | Reaction | Final NN State (`S_f, L_f, J_f`) & `l_X` | Rule 1 (`J_f=l_X`)? | Rule 2 (`L_f+l_X` odd?) | Rule 3 (`S_f+l_f` odd?) | Rule 4 (`S_f=0,1`)? | Verdict |\n| :---: | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| A) | 1S0 -> 3D3 + f | (1, 2, 3) + l=3 | `3=3` (✔️) | `2+3=5` (✔️) | `1+2=3` (✔️) | S=1 (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n| B) | 1S0 -> 3S1 + p | (1, 0, 1) + l=1 | `1=1` (✔️) | `0+1=1` (✔️) | `1+0=1` (✔️) | S=1 (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n| C) | 1S0 -> 3P0 + s | (1, 1, 0) + l=0 | `0=0` (✔️) | `1+0=1` (✔️) | `1+1=2` (❌) | S=1 (✔️) | **Not Permitted** |\n| D) | 1S0 -> 7D1 + p | (3, 2, 1) + l=1 | `1=1` (✔️) | `2+1=3` (✔️) | `3+2=5` (✔️) | S=3 (❌) | **Not Permitted** |\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nOur analysis reveals two non-permitted reactions:\n\n*   **Option C (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`) is not permitted** because it violates Rule 3, the Pauli statistics constraint provided for a final state with `T=0`. The sum `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` is even, whereas the rule requires it to be odd.\n\n*   **Option D (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`) is not permitted** because it violates Rule 4. The final state `7D1` requires the two-nucleon system to have a total spin of `S=3`, which is physically impossible.\n\nSince the question asks for a single forbidden partial wave, we must discern the intended answer. The problem explicitly directs us to use the conservation laws and the provided Pauli statistics relation. Option C is forbidden because it directly fails one of these specific selection rules governing the *process*. The problem with Option D is more fundamental; the proposed final *product* is impossible, regardless of the process. In the context of this type of physics question, the intended answer is the one that fails the specific test of the selection rules that were laid out.\n\nTherefore, the partial wave `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the one that is not permitted based on the specific conditions of the problem.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Initial State and Identify the Governing Rules\n\nFirst, we analyze the initial state and derive the selection rules that any permitted transition must obey.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system starts as two nucleons (NN) in a **1S0** state. The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us its quantum numbers:\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` → Initial Total Spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` → Initial Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` → Initial Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The initial parity is `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Reaction Rules:** The transition `1S0 → NN_f + X` must follow these rules:\n\n    1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The initial `J_i=0`. The final total angular momentum (`J_f` from the final NN state and `l_X` from the particle X, assuming it is spinless) must also couple to zero. This requires their magnitudes to be equal:\n        `J_f = l_X`\n\n    2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The initial parity (`+1`) must equal the final parity. The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`. For `P_i = P_f`, we need `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`, which requires `L_f + l_X` to be **odd**.\n\n    3.  **Pauli Statistics Constraint:** The problem provides the rule for the final state `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Given `T_f = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`, which requires `S_f + L_f` to be **odd**.\n\n    4.  **Physicality of the Final State:** Two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` (singlet, `2S+1=1`) or `S=1` (triplet, `2S+1=3`). Any state with a different total spin (e.g., `S=3`) is physically impossible.\n\n### Step 2: Systematically Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe now test each proposed reaction against these four rules.

Option A is the reaction that is disallowed specifically by one of these enumerated rules governing the *process*. Option C is disallowed because the *product* itself is impossible. In the context of a physics problem testing specific selection rules, the intended answer is the one that directly violates those rules.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a systematic analysis to determine the final answer by synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Establish Selection Rules\n\nFirst, we must identify the quantum numbers of the initial state and all the physical rules that govern the reaction.\n\n*   **Initial State**: The system is a two-nucleon (NN) bound state `1S0`. From the standard spectroscopic notation `(2S+1)L(J)`, we determine the initial (`i`) quantum numbers:\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` → Initial Total Spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` → Initial Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` → Initial Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The initial parity is `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Reaction and Final State**: The reaction is `NN(1S0) → NN_final + X`.\n    *   The particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has a specified isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n\n*   **The Selection Rules**: A reaction is permitted only if it satisfies all of the following physical principles. A violation of any single rule makes the reaction \"not permitted\" or \"forbidden\".\n\n    1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (`J`)**: Since the initial total angular momentum `J_i` is 0, the final total angular momentum must also be 0. This is the vector sum of the final NN system's `J_f` and particle X's orbital angular momentum `l_X` (assuming X is a spinless particle, as is standard). For the sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal:\n        **Condition 1: `J_f = l_X`**\n\n    2.  **Conservation of Parity (`P`)**: The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity (`P_f`). `P_f` is the product of the parities of the final state components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_{intrinsic} * P(X)_{orbital} = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`. For parity to be conserved (`P_i = P_f`), we need `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`. This requires the exponent to be an even number.\n        **Condition 2: `L_f + l_X` must be odd.**\n\n    3.  **Pauli Statistics Constraint**: The problem provides a specific condition for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Given the final state has `T(NN) = 0`, the condition becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This holds only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number.\n        **Condition 3: `S_f + L_f` must be odd.**\n\n    4.  **Physicality of the Final State (Implicit Rule)**: Two nucleons are spin-1/2 fermions. The rules of angular momentum addition dictate that their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet state) or `S=1` (triplet state). Any other total spin value is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n        **Condition 4: `S_f` must be 0 or 1.**\n\n### Step 2: Systematically Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe now apply these four rules to each of the proposed reactions. The lowercase letters denote the angular momentum state of X: s(l=0), p(l=1), d(l=2), f(l=3).\n\n| Option | Reaction | Decoded State `(S_f, L_f, J_f) + l_X` | `J_f=l_X`? (Rule 1) | `L_f+l_X` odd? (Rule 2) | `S_f+L_f` odd? (Rule 3) | `S_f=0` or `1`?

The proposed final state `7D1` requires the two nucleons to form a total spin state of `S=3` (since `2S+1=7`). This is physically impossible for two spin-1/2 particles.\n\n*   **Option D (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`) is not permitted.** It violates **Rule 3**, the specific Pauli statistics constraint that was explicitly provided in the problem. For the `3P0` state, `S_f=1` and `L_f=1`, making their sum `S_f + L_f = 2` (an even number), which is forbidden by the rule for a `T=0` final state.\n\nThe question asks for the single forbidden partial wave. This requires us to discern the question's primary intent. The prompt instructs the solver to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the provided \"Pauli statistics\". Option D is forbidden precisely because it fails a direct application of these specific rules governing the *transition*. The issue with Option C is the non-existence of the *final product*, which relies on an implicit, albeit fundamental, piece of knowledge not enumerated in the transition rules to check. In such physics problems, the intended answer is the one that violates the specific rules provided for the process under consideration.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Assuming the emitted particle X is spin-0 (a standard assumption for mesons like pions in such problems), its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum, `l_X`. To conserve angular momentum, the final total angular momentum must also be 0. This means the final NN state's angular momentum `J_f` and the particle's `l_X` must be able to couple to zero, which requires their magnitudes to be equal.\n    *   **Rule 1: `J_f = l_X`**\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The initial parity `P_i` is +1. The final parity `P_f` must also be +1. `P_f` is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X_intrinsic) * P(X_orbital) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`. The conservation equation `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}` holds only if the exponent is even.\n    *   **Rule 2: `L_f + l_X` must be odd.**\n\n3.  **Pauli Statistics Constraint (Explicitly Given):** The problem provides a specific constraint for the final `T_f=0` NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Substituting `T_f = 0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This holds only if the term `S_f + L_f + 1` is even.\n    *   **Rule 3: `S_f + L_f` must be odd.**\n\n4.  **Physical Possibility of the NN State (Implicit Rule):** Nucleons are spin-1/2 fermions. A system of two nucleons can only have a total spin of `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any other total spin value is physically impossible.\n    *   **Rule 4: `S_f` must be 0 or 1.**\n\n### Step 2: Systematically Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now apply these four rules to each option from the original question. A reaction is forbidden if it fails even one rule.\n\n| Option | Reaction | (`S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`) + `l_X` | Rule 1? `J_f=l_X` | Rule 2? `L_f+l_X` odd | Rule 3? `S_f+L_f` odd | Rule 4? `S_f` is 0/1 | **Result** |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| A) | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p` | (1, 0, 1) + 1 | `1=1` ✔️ | `0+1=1` ✔️ | `1+0=1` ✔️ | S=1 ✔️ | **Permitted** |\n| B) | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f` | (1, 2, 3) + 3 | `3=3` ✔️ | `2+3=5` ✔️ | `1+2=3` ✔️ | S=1 ✔️ | **Permitted** |\n| C) | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` | (1, 1, 0) + 0 | `0=0` ✔️ | `1+0=1` ✔️ | `1+1=2` ❌ | S=1 ✔️ | **Not Permitted** |\n| D) | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p` | (3, 2, 1) + 1 | `1=1` ✔️ | `2+1=3` ✔️ | `3+2=5` ✔️ | S=3 ❌ | **Not Permitted** |\n\n### Step 3: Analysis and Final Decision\n\nThe analysis reveals that two of the reactions are not permitted, a crucial point of understanding.\n\n*   **Option C (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`) is not permitted.** It violates **Rule 3**, the Pauli statistics constraint that was explicitly provided in the problem for a final state with `T(NN)=0`. The physically possible final state (`3P0`) is allowed to exist, but this specific *process* leading to it as a `T=0` state is forbidden.\n\n*   **Option D (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`) is not permitted.** It violates **Rule 4**, the fundamental principle that two nucleons cannot form a total spin of `S=3`. The *process* itself formally obeys the transition rules (1, 2, and 3), but it leads to a *product* that is physically impossible.\n\n**Which one is the intended answer?** The question asks to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the provided Pauli rule. Option C is the one that is invalidated directly by applying these specific rules for the transition process. The issue with Option D is a more fundamental error concerning the very existence of the final state, which is a piece of knowledge separate from the specific decay dynamics mentioned in the prompt. Therefore, the answer that best demonstrates the application of the problem's stated rules is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must analyze each proposed reaction against a set of rules derived from conservation laws and the specific constraints provided in the problem.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Governing Rules\n\n*   **Initial State (`1S0`)**: The initial two-nucleon (NN) system has the following quantum numbers, derived from the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n    *   Total Spin: `S_i = 0`\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum: `L_i = 0`\n    *   Total Angular Momentum: `J_i = 0`\n    *   Parity: `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`\n\n*   **Reaction and Final State**: The reaction is `NN(1S0) -> NN_f + X`, where `NN_f` has quantum numbers `S_f, L_f, J_f` and isospin `T_f = 0`. Particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` and orbital angular momentum `l_X`.\n\n*   **Selection Rules**: A transition is allowed only if it satisfies all of the following rules:\n    1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**: The initial total angular momentum `J_i` is 0. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of `J_f` and `l_X` (assuming particle X is spinless). For the sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal.\n        *   **Condition: `J_f = l_X`**\n    2.  **Conservation of Parity**: The initial parity `P_i = +1` must equal the final parity `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_{int} * P(X)_{orb} = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`. For `P_i = P_f`, it is required that `L_f + l_X` is an **odd** number.\n        *   **Condition: `L_f + l_X` is odd.**\n    3.  **Pauli Statistics Constraint**: The problem provides the rule `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. For the specified `T_f = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`, which requires that `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n        *   **Condition: `S_f + L_f` is odd.**\n    4.  **Physical Possibility of NN States**: A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 fermions) can only have a total spin of `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any other spin value is physically impossible.\n\n### 2. Systematic Evaluation of Options\n\nWe now test each reaction against these four rules.\n\n| Option | Reaction            | Decoded Final State: `(S_f, L_f, J_f) + l_X` | Ang.

Conclusion\n\nOur analysis identifies two non-permitted reactions:\n*   **A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**: This reaction is forbidden because the final state `7D1` requires the two nucleons to form a spin `S=3` state, which is physically impossible.\n*   **B) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**: This reaction is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics constraint given in the problem. The final state `3P0` has `S_f = 1` and `L_f = 1`, making their sum `S_f + L_f = 2` (even). For a `T=0` state, this sum must be odd.\n\nSince the question asks for a single forbidden partial wave, we must discern the intended answer. The question specifically directs us to use the rules of conservation and the given Pauli statistics constraint. Option **B** is forbidden precisely because it fails one of these explicit rules governing the *transition dynamics*. The problem with Option **A** lies in the physical *existence* of the final state, which is a different type of violation. In physics problems designed to test selection rules, the intended answer is the one that violates the specific rules provided for the process.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Problem and State Analysis\n\nFirst, we analyze the quantum numbers of the initial state and establish the rules that govern the reaction.\n\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. The spectroscopic notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n    *   **Total Spin `S_i`:** From `2S_i + 1 = 1`, we get `S_i = 0`.\n    *   **Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i`:** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n    *   **Total Angular Momentum `J_i`:** The subscript is '0', so `J_i = 0`.\n    *   **Parity `P_i`:** Parity is given by `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has an isospin of `T(NN)_f = 0`.\n\n### 2. Establishing the Selection Rules\n\nA reaction is permitted only if it satisfies all of the following physical principles:\n\n1.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final State:** The problem explicitly provides a constraint for the final state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   For the given `T_f = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation requires `S_f + L_f + 1` to be an even number, which means the sum **`S_f + L_f` must be odd**.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity must be the same before and after the reaction (`P_i = P_f`).\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X_intrinsic) * P(X_orbital) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   For `P_i = P_f`, we need `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n    *   This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be even, meaning **`L_f + l_X` must be odd**.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum must be conserved (`J_i = J_f`).\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of `J_f` (from the final NN state) and `l_X` (assuming the emitted particle is spinless).\n    *   For the sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal: **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n4.  **Physicality of States:** Two nucleons are spin-1/2 fermions. Their total spin can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any other spin value is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of Options\n\nWe now test each proposed reaction against these four rules.\n\n| Option | Reaction | Decoded State `(S_f, L_f, J_f)` + `l_X` | Pauli (`S_f+L_f` odd)? | Parity (`L_f+l_X` odd)? | Ang. Mom. (`J_f=l_X`)? | Physical `S_f`? | Permitted? |\n| :---: | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **A** | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` | `S=1, L=1, J=0` + `l=0` | `1+1=2` (Even) **❌** | `1+0=1` (Odd) ✔️ | `0=0` ✔️ | `S=1` ✔️ | **No** |\n| **B** | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p` | `S=3, L=2, J=1` + `l=1` | `3+2=5` (Odd) ✔️ | `2+1=3` (Odd) ✔️ | `1=1` ✔️ | `S=3` **❌** | **No** |\n| **C** | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p` | `S=1, L=0, J=1` + `l=1` | `1+0=1` (Odd) ✔️ | `0+1=1` (Odd) ✔️ | `1=1` ✔️ | `S=1` ✔️ | Yes |\n| **D** | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f` | `S=1, L=2, J=3` + `l=3` | `1+2=3` (Odd) ✔️ | `2+3=5` (Odd) ✔️ | `3=3` ✔️ | `S=1` ✔️ | Yes |\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis reveals that two of the reactions are not permitted:\n\n*   **Option A (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)**: This reaction is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics rule explicitly provided in the problem for a final `T=0` state (`S_f + L_f` must be odd, but `1+1=2` is even).\n\n*   **Option B (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)**: This reaction is forbidden because the final state `7D1` requires the two-nucleon system to have a total spin of `S=3`. This is physically impossible for a system of two spin-1/2 particles.\n\nSince a multiple-choice question should have a single best answer, we must determine the intended answer. The question specifically instructs the user to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the provided \"Pauli statistics\" rule. Option A is forbidden because it fails one of these specified rules governing the *process* of the reaction. Option B is forbidden for a more fundamental reason related to the *existence* of the final state, which relies on implicit knowledge about spin addition that is not part of the explicit rules to check. Therefore, the violation the question is designed to test is the one in Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the proposed reactions is forbidden by the laws of physics. We will systematically analyze each option by checking it against the principles of conservation of angular momentum and parity, as well as the specific Pauli statistics constraint provided in the problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Problem and Establish Selection Rules\n\nFirst, let's identify the properties of the initial state and the rules that any permitted reaction must follow.\n\n*   **Initial State (`1S0`)**: The initial two-nucleon (NN) system has the following quantum numbers, derived from the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n    *   Initial total spin `S_i = 0` (since `2S+1=1`).\n    *   Initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0` (from the letter 'S').\n    *   Initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0` (from the subscript '0').\n    *   The initial parity is `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Final State (`NN_f + X`)**: The final state consists of a two-nucleon system and an emitted particle `X`. The following rules must govern this transition:\n\n    *   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (`J`)**:\n        The initial `J_i` is 0, so the final total angular momentum must also be 0. The final angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN system's `J_f` and the particle X's orbital angular momentum `l_X` (assuming X is a spin-0 particle, a standard convention in such problems). For the vector sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal:\n        `J_f = l_X`\n\n    *   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity (`P`)**:\n        The initial parity (`+1`) must equal the final parity. The final parity is the product of its components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_{intrinsic} * P(X)_{orbital} = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`. For `P_i = P_f`, we need `+1 = -(-1)^{L_f + l_X}`. This requires the exponent of the main term to be odd, meaning:\n        `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n    *   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics (as given for the `T=0` final state)**:\n        The problem states `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Given the final state has `T(NN)=0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This equation only holds if `S_f + L_f` is an **odd** number.\n\n    *   **Rule 4: Physicality of the NN State (an implicit rule)**:\n        A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 fermions) can only have a total spin of `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). A state requiring any other spin value is physically impossible.\n\n### 2. Systematic Evaluation of Options\n\nWe will now apply these four rules to each of the proposed reactions. A reaction is forbidden if it violates even one rule.\n\n| Option | Reaction | Final NN State (`S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`) | `l_X` | Rule 1: `J_f = l_X`? | Rule 2: `L_f+l_X` odd? | Rule 3: `S_f+L_f` odd? | Rule 4: Valid `S_f`? | Conclusion |\n|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| A) | 1S0 -> 7D1 + p | `S=3`, `L=2`, `J=1` | 1 | 1 = 1 (OK) | 2+1 = 3 (OK) | 3+2 = 5 (OK) | `S=3` **(FAIL)** | **Forbidden** |\n| B) | 1S0 -> 3S1 + p | `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1` | 1 | 1 = 1 (OK) | 0+1 = 1 (OK) | 1+0 = 1 (OK) | `S=1` (OK) | **Permitted** |\n| C) | 1S0 -> 3D3 + f | `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3` | 3 | 3 = 3 (OK) | 2+3 = 5 (OK) | 1+2 = 3 (OK) | `S=1` (OK) | **Permitted** |\n| D) | 1S0 -> 3P0 + s | `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0` | 0 | 0 = 0 (OK) | 1+0 = 1 (OK) | 1+1 = 2 **(FAIL)** | `S=1` (OK) | **Forbidden** |\n\n### 3. Final Analysis and Decision\n\nOur analysis reveals two forbidden reactions for different reasons:\n*   **Option A** is forbidden because the final `7D1` state is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system (Rule 4). It requires a total spin `S=3`, but two spin-1/2 particles can only combine to form `S=0` or `S=1`.\n*   **Option D** is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics constraint (Rule 3) that was explicitly provided for the final `T=0` state. For the `3P0` state, `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is even. The rule requires this sum to be odd.\n\nThe question asks us to identify the forbidden partial wave by making use of the specified rules: conservation laws and the Pauli constraint. Option D fails one of these specific rules that govern the *process* of the transition. The failure in Option A is due to the *existence* of the final state itself, a more fundamental violation but one that is outside the explicit list of transition rules to check. In this context, the intended answer is the one that violates the selection rules given for the process.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a synthesis of the provided solutions.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Problem and Physical Principles\n\nFirst, we need to extract the quantum numbers of the initial state and establish the set of rules that govern the nuclear reaction.\n\n*   **Initial State (`1S0`):**\n    *   Using the spectroscopic notation `(2S+1)L(J)`, for the initial state (`i`) we have:\n        *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` → Initial Spin `S_i = 0`.\n        *   `L = S` → Initial Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0`.\n        *   `J = 0` → Initial Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The initial parity is `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Reaction and Final State:**\n    *   The reaction is `NN(1S0) → NN_f + X`.\n    *   Particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The final two-nucleon state `NN_f` is specified to have isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\n### 2. Establishing the Selection Rules\n\nFor a reaction to be \"permitted\", it must satisfy all relevant physical laws. The key rules are:\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (`J`)**\n    *   The initial total angular momentum `J_i` is 0. For the final total angular momentum to be 0, the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`) must be coupled to zero (assuming X is a spinless particle). This requires their magnitudes to be equal.\n    *   **Condition: `J_f = l_X`**.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity (`P`)**\n    *   Initial parity `P_i` is +1. Final parity `P_f` must also be +1.\n    *   `P_f = P(NN_f) × P(X)_intrinsic × P(X)_orbital = (-1)^{L_f} × (-1) × (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n    *   For `P_f = +1`, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be even.\n    *   **Condition: `L_f + l_X` must be odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics (Specific Rule for `T=0`)**\n    *   The problem provides the constraint `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   For the specified final state with `T_f = 0`, the equation becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   **Condition: `S_f + L_f` must be odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physical Possibility of States (Implicit Knowledge)**\n    *   A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 fermions. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any other value is physically impossible.\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of Options\n\nWe now apply these four rules to each option presented in the question. A reaction is not permitted if it fails even one rule.\n\n| Option | Reaction | Decoded Quantum Numbers `(S_f, L_f, J_f)` + `l_X` | J Cons? (`J_f=l_X`) | Parity Cons? (`L_f+l_X` odd) | Pauli Rule?

Final Conclusion\n\nOur analysis identifies two forbidden reactions:\n\n*   **Option A (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` requires the two-nucleon system to have a total spin of `S=3`. This is physically impossible for a system of two nucleons.\n*   **Option D (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)** is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics constraint (Rule 3) that was provided in the problem for a final state with `T=0`. The sum `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is even, but the rule requires it to be odd.\n\nSince the question asks for a single answer, we must determine which violation is the intended focus. The problem explicitly directs us to \"make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the provided \"Pauli statistics\" rule. Option D is forbidden *precisely* because it violates one of these stated rules governing the reaction process. The issue with Option A is the non-existence of the final product, which is a more fundamental constraint not explicitly enumerated in the problem's list of rules for the transition. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that directly fails the specific test of the interaction dynamics described.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to consolidate the reasoning from the candidate answers and arrive at the definitive correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Problem Statement\n\nFirst, we establish the quantum numbers of the initial state and the rules governing the reaction.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system is a two-nucleon (NN) bound system in a **¹S₀** state. Using the term symbol notation `(2S+1)L(J)`, we find:\n    *   Initial Total Spin (`Sᵢ`): `2Sᵢ + 1 = 1`  →  `Sᵢ = 0`.\n    *   Initial Orbital Angular Momentum (`Lᵢ`): The letter 'S' denotes `Lᵢ = 0`.\n    *   Initial Total Angular Momentum (`Jᵢ`): The subscript '0' means `Jᵢ = 0`.\n    *   Initial Parity (`Pᵢ`): Parity is given by `(-1)ᴸ`, so `Pᵢ = (-1)⁰ = +1`.\n\n*   **Reaction Rules:** The system decays via `NN(initial) → NN(final) + X`. We must test the proposed final states against a set of rules.\n    1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** Since `Jᵢ = 0`, the total angular momentum of the final state must also be 0. This is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and particle X's angular momentum. Assuming X is spinless (standard in such problems), its angular momentum is its orbital angular momentum `l_X`. For the sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n    2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The initial parity (`+1`) must equal the final parity. The final parity `P_f` is the product of the parity of the final NN system (`(-1) ^ L_f`), the intrinsic parity of X (`-1`), and the parity of the orbital motion of X (`(-1) ^ l_X`).\n        *   `P_f = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n        *   For `P_i = P_f`, we need `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`. This requires the exponent to be even, meaning **`L_f + l_X` must be odd**.\n    3.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final State:** The problem gives a specific rule for the final `T_f = 0` NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n        *   Substituting `T_f = 0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n        *   This equation requires `S_f + L_f + 1` to be an even number. Therefore, **`S_f + L_f` must be odd**.\n    4.  **Physical Possibility of States:** Two nucleons are spin-½ particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet, `2S+1=1`) or `S=1` (triplet, `2S+1=3`). A state with any other spin value is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Option Systematically\n\nWe now test each reaction from the original question prompt against these four rules.\n\n*   **A) ¹S₀ → ³S₁ + p**\n    *   Final NN state (`³S₁`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`. Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n    *   1. J Cons: `J_f = l_X`? → `1=1`. (Pass)\n    *   2. P Cons: `L_f+l_X` odd? → `0+1=1`. (Pass)\n    *   3. Pauli: `S_f+L_f` odd? → `1+0=1`. (Pass)\n    *   4. Physicality: `S_f=1`? (Pass)\n    *   **Verdict: Permitted**\n\n*   **B) ¹S₀ → ³D₃ + f**\n    *   Final NN state (`³D₃`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`. Particle X (`f`): `l_X=3`.\n    *   1. J Cons: `J_f = l_X`? → `3=3`. (Pass)\n    *   2. P Cons: `L_f+l_X` odd? → `2+3=5`. (Pass)\n    *   3. Pauli: `S_f+L_f` odd? → `1+2=3`. (Pass)\n    *   4. Physicality: `S_f=1`? (Pass)\n    *   **Verdict: Permitted**\n\n*   **C) ¹S₀ → ³P₀ + s**\n    *   Final NN state (`³P₀`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`. Particle X (`s`): `l_X=0`.\n    *   1. J Cons: `J_f = l_X`? → `0=0`. (Pass)\n    *   2. P Cons: `L_f+l_X` odd? → `1+0=1`. (Pass)\n    *   3. Pauli: `S_f+L_f` odd? → `1+1=2`. This is **even**, violating the rule. **(Fail)**\n    *   4. Physicality: `S_f=1`? (Pass)\n    *   **Verdict: Not Permitted**\n\n*   **D) ¹S₀ → ⁷D₁ + p**\n    *   Final NN state (`⁷D₁`): `2S_f+1=7` → `S_f=3`.\n    *   4. Physicality: `S_f=3`? This is **impossible** for a two-nucleon system. **(Fail)**\n    *   (Even though the reaction is already forbidden, we note it passes rules 1, 2, and 3.)\n    *   **Verdict: Not Permitted**\n\n### 3. Conclusion and Final Answer\n\nThe analysis reveals two forbidden reactions: C and D.\n*   **Reaction D is forbidden** because the proposed final state, `⁷D₁`, is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. The violation is in the existence of the product itself.\n*   **Reaction C is forbidden** because it violates a specific selection rule for the *transition*, namely the Pauli statistics constraint (`S_f + L_f` must be odd) that was explicitly stated in the problem for a final `T_f=0` state.\n\nThe question explicitly asks to \"make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the provided \"Pauli statistics\" rule. Reaction C is the one that is disallowed specifically by these rules of the process. The issue with Reaction D is more fundamental and lies outside the specific transition rules enumerated in the prompt. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that fails the selection rule test.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the forbidden partial wave from the given options.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Initial State and Governing Rules\n\nFirst, we establish the quantum numbers of the initial state and the selection rules that govern the reaction.\n\n*   **Initial State**: The two-nucleon (NN) system is in a `1S0` state. Using the term symbol notation `(2S+1)L(J)`, we find:\n    *   **Initial Spin (`S_i`)**: `2S_i + 1 = 1` → `S_i = 0`\n    *   **Initial Orbital Angular Momentum (`L_i`)**: The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n    *   **Initial Total Angular Momentum (`J_i`)**: The subscript is '0', so `J_i = 0`.\n    *   **Initial Parity (`P_i`)**: Parity is given by `(-1)^L`. Therefore, `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Reaction**: `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`. The particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. The final NN state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n\n*   **Selection Rules**: A transition is permitted only if it satisfies all of the following conditions:\n\n    1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (`J`)**: The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of `J_f` (from the final NN state) and `l_X` (the orbital angular momentum of particle X, assuming it is spinless). For the total to remain zero, their magnitudes must be equal: **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n    2.  **Conservation of Parity (`P`)**: The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity (`P_f`). `P_f` is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_{intrinsic} * P(X)_{orbital}`. So, `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`. This simplifies to requiring that `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n    3.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final State**: The problem provides a specific constraint for the final `T_f=0` NN state: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. Substituting `T_f = 0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This requires `S_f + L_f` to be an **odd** number.\n\n    4.  **Physicality of the Final State**: A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 fermions. Their total spin can only be `S=0` (singlet state, `2S+1=1`) or `S=1` (triplet state, `2S+1=3`). A state with any other spin, such as `S=3` (multiplicity `2S+1=7`), is physically impossible.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will test each proposed partial wave against these four rules.\n\n| Option | Reaction | Decoded State `(S_f, L_f, J_f)` + `l_X` | `J_f = l_X`? (Rule 1) | `L_f + l_X` odd? (Rule 2) | `S_f + L_f` odd? (Rule 3) | `S_f=0` or `1`? (Rule 4) | Verdict |\n|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| **A)** | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` | (1, 1, 0) + 0 | `0=0` (✔️) | `1+0=1` (✔️) | `1+1=2` (❌) | `S=1` (✔️) | **Not Permitted** |\n| **B)** | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f` | (1, 2, 3) + 3 | `3=3` (✔️) | `2+3=5` (✔️) | `1+2=3` (✔️) | `S=1` (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n| **C)** | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p` | (3, 2, 1) + 1 | `1=1` (✔️) | `2+1=3` (✔️) | `3+2=5` (✔️) | `S=3` (❌) | **Not Permitted** |\n| **D)** | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p` | (1, 0, 1) + 1 | `1=1` (✔️) | `0+1=1` (✔️) | `1+0=1` (✔️) | `S=1` (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nOur analysis shows that two reactions, A and C, are not permitted.\n*   **Reaction A (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)** is not permitted because it violates the Pauli statistics constraint (Rule 3) explicitly given in the problem for a final `T=0` state. For the `3P0` state, `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is even, but the rule requires an odd sum.\n*   **Reaction C (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)** is not permitted because the final NN state `7D1` requires a total spin `S=3`, which is physically impossible for a system of two nucleons (Rule 4).\n\nThe question asks for the single non-permitted partial wave and instructs us to \"make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the provided \"Pauli statistics\". Reaction A is the one forbidden by these explicit rules governing the *process* of the transition. Reaction C is forbidden for a more fundamental reason related to the *existence* of the final state itself. In the context of such physics problems, the intended answer is the one that directly fails the stated selection rules for the transition.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers and a first-principles approach.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Problem and Establish Selection Rules\n\nFirst, let's distill the physical principles and constraints from the problem description.\n\n**Initial State**: The system starts as two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n*   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives the quantum numbers for the initial state (`i`):\n    *   **Initial Spin (`S_i`)**: `2S_i + 1 = 1` → `S_i = 0`.\n    *   **Initial Orbital Angular Momentum (`L_i`)**: The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n    *   **Initial Total Angular Momentum (`J_i`)**: The subscript is '0', so `J_i = 0`.\n    *   **Initial Parity (`P_i`)**: Parity is `(-1)^L`, so `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**The Reaction**: `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`\n*   Particle `X` has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`.\n*   The final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\n**The Rules of the Game (Selection Rules)**:\nFor a reaction to be \"permitted\", it must satisfy all of the following rules. A reaction that violates any of them is \"not permitted\" or \"forbidden\".\n\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (`J`)**:\n    *   The initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum (the vector sum of the final NN system's `J_f` and the particle X's orbital momentum `l_X`) must also be zero. This requires that their magnitudes be equal.\n    *   **Rule:** `J_f = l_X`\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (`P`)**:\n    *   The initial parity `P_i = +1`. The final parity must also be `+1`.\n    *   The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X_intrinsic) * P(X_orbital) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   For `P_f` to equal `+1`, the exponent in `(-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}` must be even.\n    *   **Rule:** `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n3.  **Pauli Statistics Constraint**:\n    *   The problem explicitly states a rule for the final state: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Since the final state must have `T_f = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This requires the sum `S_f + L_f + 1` to be an even number.\n    *   **Rule:** `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n4.  **Physicality of the Final State**:\n    *   A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. By the rules of angular momentum addition, their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet state) or `S=1` (triplet state).\n    *   **Rule:** `S_f` must be either 0 or 1.\n\n### 2. Systematic Evaluation of Options\n\nLet's apply these four rules to each option given in the question.\n\n| Option | Reaction | Final NN State (`S_f, L_f, J_f`) | X (`l_X`) | Rule 1 `J_f=l_X`? | Rule 2 `L_f+l_X` odd? | Rule 3 `S_f+L_f` odd? | Rule 4 `S_f=0,1`? | Verdict |\n| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |\n| **A** | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f` | S=1, L=2, J=3 | 3 | `3=3` (✔️) | `2+3=5` (✔️) | `1+2=3` (✔️) | `S=1` (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n| **B** | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p` | S=3, L=2, J=1 | 1 | `1=1` (✔️) | `2+1=3` (✔️) | `3+2=5` (✔️) | `S=3` (**❌**) | **Not Permitted** |\n| **C** | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` | S=1, L=1, J=0 | 0 | `0=0` (✔️) | `1+0=1` (✔️) | `1+1=2` (**❌**) | `S=1` (✔️) | **Not Permitted** |\n| **D** | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p` | S=1, L=0, J=1 | 1 | `1=1` (✔️) | `0+1=1` (✔️) | `1+0=1` (✔️) | `S=1` (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n\n### 3. Conclusion and Final Answer\n\nThe analysis reveals two \"not permitted\" reactions:\n\n*   **Option B (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)** is forbidden because the final NN state `7D1` requires a total spin `S=3` (since `2S+1=7`). This is physically impossible for a system of two spin-1/2 nucleons.\n*   **Option C (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)** is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics rule explicitly given in the problem for a final state with `T_f=0`. For this final state, `S_f=1` and `L_f=1`, so their sum `S_f+L_f = 2` is even. The rule requires this sum to be odd.\n\nSince the question asks for a single forbidden partial wave, we must discern the intended answer. The prompt asks us to make use of specific rules: conservation laws and the Pauli statistics requirement.\n*   Option C is forbidden precisely because it violates one of these explicit rules governing the *process* of the reaction.\n*   Option B is forbidden for a more fundamental reason concerning the *existence* of the final product state, a condition that is implicit but not part of the explicit list of rules given for the transition.\n\nIn physics problems of this nature, the intended answer is the one that directly fails the specific selection rules provided for the scenario. Therefore, `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the forbidden partial wave the question is designed to identify.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Initial State and Selection Rules\n\nFirst, we establish the properties of the initial state and the rules that any valid transition must follow, based on the problem statement.\n\n*   **Initial State (`1S0`):** The initial two-nucleon (NN) system has quantum numbers derived from the `(2S+1)L(J)` term symbol notation:\n    *   Initial Total Spin: `S_i = 0` (from `2S+1=1`)\n    *   Initial Orbital Angular Momentum: `L_i = 0` (from the letter 'S')\n    *   Initial Total Angular Momentum: `J_i = 0` (from the subscript '0')\n    *   Initial Parity: `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`\n\n*   **Selection Rules for the Reaction `1S0 -> NN_f + X`:**\n    A transition is permitted only if it satisfies all of the following rules:\n\n    1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:** The initial total angular momentum `J_i` is 0. For the final total angular momentum to also be 0, the angular momenta of the final products (`J_f` for the NN system and `l_X` for particle X, assuming X is spinless) must couple to zero. This requires their magnitudes to be equal:\n        `J_f = l_X`\n\n    2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity (`P_f`). `P_f` is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_{intrinsic} * P(X)_{orbital} = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`. For parity to be conserved, `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`, which requires that the sum:\n        `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n    3.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final State:** The problem gives a specific rule for the final state with isospin `T(NN) = 0`: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Substituting `T(NN)=0` gives `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`, which requires that the sum:\n        `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n\n    4.  **Physicality of States (Implicit Rule):** A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any other spin value is physically impossible for the final `NN_f` state.\n\n### 2. Systematic Evaluation of Options\n\nWe now test each proposed reaction against these four rules.\n\n*   **A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n    *   `NN_f = 3D3` means `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`. Particle X is in an `f` wave, so `l_X=3`.\n    *   Rule 1 (`J_f=l_X`): `3=3`. (Pass)\n    *   Rule 2 (`L_f+l_X` odd): `2+3 = 5`. (Pass)\n    *   Rule 3 (`S_f+L_f` odd): `1+2 = 3`. (Pass)\n    *   Rule 4 (Physicality): `S_f=1`. (Pass)\n    *   **Conclusion: Permitted.**\n\n*   **B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n    *   `NN_f = 7D1` means `2S_f+1=7`, so `S_f=3`.\n    *   Rule 4 (Physicality): A state with `S_f=3` is **physically impossible** for two nucleons.\n    *   **Conclusion: Not Permitted.** The reaction is forbidden because the final state cannot exist.\n\n*   **C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n    *   `NN_f = 3P0` means `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`. Particle X is in an `s` wave, so `l_X=0`.\n    *   Rule 3 (`S_f+L_f` odd): `1+1 = 2` (even). **This violates the Pauli statistics rule.**\n    *   Let's check other rules: `J_f=l_X` -> `0=0` (Pass), `L_f+l_X` odd -> `1+0=1` (Pass), Physicality -> `S_f=1` (Pass).\n    *   **Conclusion: Not Permitted.** The reaction is forbidden because it violates one of the explicit transition rules given in the problem.\n\n*   **D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n    *   `NN_f = 3S1` means `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`. Particle X is in a `p` wave, so `l_X=1`.\n    *   Rule 1 (`J_f=l_X`): `1=1`. (Pass)\n    *   Rule 2 (`L_f+l_X` odd): `0+1 = 1`. (Pass)\n    *   Rule 3 (`S_f+L_f` odd): `1+0 = 1`. (Pass)\n    *   Rule 4 (Physicality): `S_f=1`. (Pass)\n    *   **Conclusion: Permitted.**\n\n### 3. Final Decision\n\nBoth options B and C represent forbidden reactions, but for different reasons.\n*   **Option B** is forbidden because the proposed final product (`7D1` state) is unphysical and cannot exist for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **Option C** is forbidden because the transition to the specified `T=0` final state violates the Pauli statistics rule explicitly provided in the question.\n\nThe question asks us to identify the non-permitted partial wave by making use of the conservation laws and the *given* Pauli rule. Option C is the choice that is invalidated by a direct application of these specific transition rules. The issue with Option B is a more fundamental one concerning the existence of the final state, which is prerequisite knowledge not part of the decay dynamics themselves. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that directly fails the test laid out in the problem statement.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Problem and Establish the Selection Rules\n\nFirst, we must break down the problem into its components and identify the physical rules that govern the reaction.\n\n*   **Initial State**: The system is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. From the spectroscopic notation `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can determine the initial quantum numbers:\n    *   `S_i = 0` (initial total spin, from `2S+1=1`)\n    *   `L_i = 0` (initial orbital angular momentum, from the letter 'S')\n    *   `J_i = 0` (initial total angular momentum, from the subscript '0')\n    *   The initial parity is `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Reaction**: `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`. The problem requires us to evaluate several proposed final states.\n\nWe must check each proposal against a set of rules. A reaction is forbidden if it violates any of them.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**. The initial total angular momentum `J_i` is 0. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`). For the final sum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal: **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity (P)**. The initial parity `P_i` is +1. The final parity `P_f` is the product of the parities of the final state components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_{intrinsic} * P(X)_{orbital} = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`. For parity to be conserved (`P_i = P_f`), we must have `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`. This requires the exponent to be an even number, which means the sum **`L_f + l_X` must be odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics Condition**. The problem gives a specific condition derived from the Pauli exclusion principle for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Since we are told the final state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`, the condition becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This equation holds only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number, which means the sum **`S_f + L_f` must be odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physical Possibility of the NN State**. Two nucleons are spin-1/2 particles. According to the rules of angular momentum addition, their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any other value, such as `S=3` (septet), is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\n### 2. Systematic Evaluation of Options\n\nWe now apply these four rules to each option provided in the question.\n\n| Option | Reaction | Decoded State `(S_f, L_f, J_f) + l_X` | `J_f=l_X`? | `L_f+l_X` odd? | `S_f+L_f` odd? | `S_f=0` or `1`? | Verdict |\n|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|\n| A) | 1S0 -> 3D3 + f | (1, 2, 3) + 3 | 3 = 3 (✔️) | 2+3=5 (✔️) | 1+2=3 (✔️) | S=1 (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n| B) | 1S0 -> 3P0 + s | (1, 1, 0) + 0 | 0 = 0 (✔️) | 1+0=1 (✔️) | 1+1=2 (**❌**) | S=1 (✔️) | **Not Permitted** |\n| C) | 1S0 -> 7D1 + p | (3, 2, 1) + 1 | 1 = 1 (✔️) | 2+1=3 (✔️) | 3+2=5 (✔️) | S=3 (**❌**) | **Not Permitted** |\n| D) | 1S0 -> 3S1 + p | (1, 0, 1) + 1 | 1 = 1 (✔️) | 0+1=1 (✔️) | 1+0=1 (✔️) | S=1 (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nOur analysis identifies two partial waves that are not permitted:\n\n*   **B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**: This reaction is forbidden because it violates **Rule 3**, the specific Pauli statistics constraint provided in the problem. The sum `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is an even number, but the rule requires it to be odd for a `T=0` final state.\n*   **C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**: This reaction is forbidden because it violates **Rule 4**. The final NN state `7D1` requires a total spin `S_f=3`, which is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\nThe question asks for a single forbidden partial wave. When presented with two forbidden options for different reasons, we must interpret the question's intent. The problem explicitly instructs us to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the provided \"Pauli statistics\" rule. Option B is forbidden precisely because it violates one of these explicit rules of the *transition*. Option C is forbidden for a more fundamental reason about the *existence* of the final state itself. In the context of such physics problems, the intended answer is the one that directly fails the provided selection rule test.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Problem and Physical Principles\n\nThe question asks us to identify a forbidden nuclear decay from a list of possibilities, based on a specific set of rules.\n\n**Initial State:** The system is two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. We can determine its quantum numbers from the term symbol notation `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   **Total Spin (`S_i`):** `2S_i + 1 = 1` means `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (`L_i`):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (`J_i`):** The subscript '0' means `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (`P_i`):** The parity is given by `(-1)^L`. Thus, `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**Reaction:** The decay is `NN(1S0) -> NN_final + X`.\n*   Particle `X` has an intrinsic parity of `-1`.\n*   The final NN state has an isospin of `T(NN) = 0`.\n\n### 2. The Governing Selection Rules\n\nFor a reaction to be permitted, it must satisfy all relevant physical laws. The problem instructs us to use conservation laws and a given Pauli statistics rule.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`), assuming X is spinless. For the sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal.\n    **Condition: `J_f = l_X`**\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity (P)**\n    The initial parity `P_i = +1` must equal the final parity `P_f`. `P_f` is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X_intrinsic) * P(X_orbital) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`. For `P_i = P_f`, we need `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`. This is only true if the exponent is an even number.\n    **Condition: `L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.**\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\n    The problem provides the constraint `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Given the final state has `T(NN) = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This equation is only satisfied if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number.\n    **Condition: `S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.**\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physical Possibility of States**\n    Two nucleons are spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). A state with `2S+1=7` implies `S=3`, which is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of Options\n\nLet's test each option against these four rules.

Conclusion\n\nWe have identified two forbidden reactions, A and B, for distinct reasons:\n*   **Option B (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)** is forbidden because the final product state (`7D1`) is physically impossible for two nucleons to form.\n*   **Option A (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)** is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics rule provided in the problem for a reaction leading to a `T=0` final state. For the `3P0` state, `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is an even number, failing Rule 3.\n\nThe question asks for the partial wave that is not permitted, implying a single answer. We must choose the most fitting answer based on the question's framing. The prompt explicitly asks us to use conservation laws and the provided Pauli rule. Option A is forbidden precisely by a direct application of these specified rules for the *transition process*. The issue with Option B is a violation of a more fundamental principle concerning the *existence of the state itself*. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that directly tests the principles enumerated in the question.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the problem and the provided reasoning.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State and the Reaction\n\nFirst, we decode the quantum numbers of the initial two-nucleon (NN) system, which is in a `1S0` state. Using the standard term symbol notation `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   **Initial Spin (`S_i`):** `2S_i + 1 = 1` gives `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Initial Orbital Angular Momentum (`L_i`):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Initial Total Angular Momentum (`J_i`):** The subscript '0' indicates `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Initial Parity (`P_i`):** The parity is `(-1)^{L_i}`, so `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\nThe reaction is `NN(1S0) -> NN_final + X`, where particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1.\n\n### 2. Establish the Selection Rules\n\nFor a reaction to be \"permitted\", it must obey all relevant physical laws. The problem guides us to use conservation of angular momentum and parity, as well as a specific Pauli statistics rule.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`). For the final sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal.\n    **Condition: `J_f = l_X`**\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity (P)**\n    The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity (`P_f`). The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_{intrinsic} * P(X)_{orbital} = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`. For `P_i = P_f`, we need `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`. This is only true if the exponent is even.\n    **Condition: `L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.**\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\n    The problem gives a specific condition for the final `T(NN) = 0` state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Substituting `T(NN)=0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This requires the term `S_f + L_f + 1` to be an even number.\n    **Condition: `S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.**\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physical Possibility of States**\n    This is an implicit rule of physics. A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 fermions) can only have a total spin `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any other spin value is physically impossible. A state like `7D1` requires `2S+1=7`, meaning `S=3`, which cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option Systematically\n\nWe test each option from the question against these four rules. A reaction is not permitted if it fails even one rule.\n\n| Option | Reaction | Final NN State (`S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`) + X(`l_X`) | **J-Cons.?** (`J_f=l_X`) | **Parity?** (`L_f+l_X` odd) | **Pauli?** (`S_f+L_f` odd) | **Physical?** (`S_f`=0,1) | Result |\n|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| A) | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` | (1, 1, 0) + s(0) | 0 = 0 (✔️) | 1+0 = 1 (✔️) | 1+1 = 2 (❌) | S=1 (✔️) | **Not Permitted** |\n| B) | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p` | (1, 0, 1) + p(1) | 1 = 1 (✔️) | 0+1 = 1 (✔️) | 1+0 = 1 (✔️) | S=1 (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n| C) | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p` | (3, 2, 1) + p(1) | 1 = 1 (✔️) | 2+1 = 3 (✔️) | 3+2 = 5 (✔️) | S=3 (❌) | **Not Permitted** |\n| D) | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f` | (1, 2, 3) + f(3) | 3 = 3 (✔️) | 2+3 = 5 (✔️) | 1+2 = 3 (✔️) | S=1 (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nOur analysis identifies two forbidden reactions:\n*   **A) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`:** This reaction is not permitted because it violates Rule 3, the explicit Pauli statistics constraint provided in the problem. For the final state to have `T=0`, `S_f+L_f` must be odd, but for `3P0`, `S_f+L_f = 1+1 = 2`, which is even.\n*   **C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`:** This reaction is not permitted because it violates Rule 4. The proposed final state `7D1` requires a total spin `S=3`, which is physically impossible for a system of two nucleons.\n\nWhen a multiple-choice question presents two incorrect options, it is essential to determine the most direct violation according to the problem's framing. The question asks the student to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the \"Pauli statistics\" rule. Option A fails precisely because of these stated rules governing the transition dynamics. Option C fails for a more fundamental reason related to the existence of the product itself, which is outside the list of transition rules to be checked. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that directly tests the application of the problem's specific constraints.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires a systematic application of several principles of nuclear physics to determine which reaction is forbidden. Let's break down the rules and apply them to each option.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Initial State and Selection Rules\n\n**Initial State (`1S0`):**\nFrom the spectroscopic notation `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can deduce the quantum numbers of the initial two-nucleon (NN) system:\n*   **Total Spin (`S_i`):** `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (`L_i`):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (`J_i`):** The subscript '0' means `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (`P_i`):** The parity is `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**Selection Rules for the Reaction `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`:**\nA reaction is permitted only if it obeys all the following rules, which are derived from the problem statement and fundamental physics.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The initial `J_i = 0`, so the final total angular momentum must also be 0. The final `J_total` is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`, assuming X is spinless). For the vector sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal.\n    *   **Rule 1: `J_f = l_X`**\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity (`P_f`).\n    *   `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_{intrinsic} * P(X)_{orbital} = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   For `P_f` to equal `+1`, we must have `(-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1} = +1`. This requires the exponent to be even.\n    *   **Rule 2: `L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.**\n\n3.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final State:** The problem explicitly provides a rule for the final state when its isospin is `T(NN) = 0`:\n    *   `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Substituting `T(NN) = 0` gives `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This requires `S_f + L_f + 1` to be an even number.\n    *   **Rule 3: `S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.**\n\n4.  **Physical Possibility of NN States:** A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 fermions) can only have a total spin of `S=0` (singlet, `2S+1=1`) or `S=1` (triplet, `2S+1=3`). Any other spin multiplicity is physically impossible.\n\n### 2. Systematic Evaluation of Options\n\nLet's test each option against these four rules. A reaction is forbidden if it violates even one rule.\n\n| Option | Reaction | Final NN State (`S_f, L_f, J_f`) + X(`l_X`) | Rule 1 `J_f=l_X`? | Rule 2 `L_f+l_X` odd? | Rule 3 `S_f+L_f` odd? | Rule 4 State Physical? | Result |\n| :---: | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| A) | 1S0 -> 3P0 + s | (1, 1, 0) + 0 | `0=0` (✔️) | `1+0=1` (✔️) | `1+1=2` (❌) | S=1 (✔️) | **Not Permitted** |\n| B) | 1S0 -> 3S1 + p | (1, 0, 1) + 1 | `1=1` (✔️) | `0+1=1` (✔️) | `1+0=1` (✔️) | S=1 (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n| C) | 1S0 -> 7D1 + p | (3, 2, 1) + 1 | `1=1` (✔️) | `2+1=3` (✔️) | `3+2=5` (✔️) | S=3 (❌) | **Not Permitted** |\n| D) | 1S0 -> 3D3 + f | (1, 2, 3) + 3 | `3=3` (✔️) | `2+3=5` (✔️) | `1+2=3` (✔️) | S=1 (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n\n### 3. Final Decision\n\nOur analysis reveals two non-permitted reactions:\n\n*   **A) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`:** This reaction is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics constraint (Rule 3) explicitly given in the problem. The final NN state has `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is even, but the rule requires an odd sum for a `T=0` state.\n*   **C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`:** This reaction is forbidden because the final NN state `7D1` (`S=3`) is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system (Rule 4).\n\nThe question asks for a single forbidden partial wave and instructs us to \"make use of\" the specified rules. The issue with reaction C is the impossibility of the final product state, which is a violation of a fundamental principle but is external to the transition rules given in the prompt. Reaction A is a transition between two physically possible states (`1S0` and `3P0`), but it is forbidden by the specific \"Pauli statistics\" rule governing the transition into the `T=0` final channel. Therefore, option A is the answer that directly demonstrates a failure to apply the provided rules.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial State and Reaction\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the initial state and the process described.\n*   **Initial State**: The system starts as a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. The spectroscopic notation `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the initial quantum numbers:\n    *   Initial total spin `S_i = 0` (from `2S+1=1`).\n    *   Initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0` (from the letter 'S').\n    *   Initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0` (from the subscript '0').\n*   **Parity**: The initial parity is given by `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Reaction**: The system decays via `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has a specified isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n\n### Step 2: Establish the Selection Rules\n\nFor a reaction to be \"permitted\", it must satisfy all relevant conservation laws and specific constraints from the problem.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**:\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`), assuming X is spinless. For the vector sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal.\n    **Rule 1: `J_f = l_X`**\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P)**:\n    The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity (`P_f`).\n    `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X_intrinsic) * P(X_orbital) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    For parity to be conserved, `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`. This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be even.\n    **Rule 2: `L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.**\n\n3.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final State**:\n    The problem provides the constraint `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. For the specified final state with `T(NN) = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This equation holds only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number.\n    **Rule 3: `S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.**\n\n4.  **Physicality of the Final State**:\n    Two nucleons are spin-1/2 fermions. Their total spin can only combine to form `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any other total spin, such as `S=3` (which would correspond to a spin multiplicity of `2S+1 = 7`), is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n    **Rule 4: The final spin `S_f` must be 0 or 1.**\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each of the four proposed reactions against these rules. A reaction is forbidden if it fails any rule.\n\n| Option | Reaction | Final NN State (`S_f, L_f, J_f`) & `l_X` | Rule 1 (`J_f=l_X`)? | Rule 2 (`L_f+l_X` odd?) | Rule 3 (`S_f+l_f` odd?) | Rule 4 (`S_f=0,1`)? | Verdict |\n| :---: | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| A) | 1S0 -> 3D3 + f | (1, 2, 3) + l=3 | `3=3` (✔️) | `2+3=5` (✔️) | `1+2=3` (✔️) | S=1 (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n| B) | 1S0 -> 3S1 + p | (1, 0, 1) + l=1 | `1=1` (✔️) | `0+1=1` (✔️) | `1+0=1` (✔️) | S=1 (✔️) | **Permitted** |\n| C) | 1S0 -> 3P0 + s | (1, 1, 0) + l=0 | `0=0` (✔️) | `1+0=1` (✔️) | `1+1=2` (❌) | S=1 (✔️) | **Not Permitted** |\n| D) | 1S0 -> 7D1 + p | (3, 2, 1) + l=1 | `1=1` (✔️) | `2+1=3` (✔️) | `3+2=5` (✔️) | S=3 (❌) | **Not Permitted** |\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nOur analysis reveals two non-permitted reactions:\n\n*   **Option C (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`) is not permitted** because it violates Rule 3, the Pauli statistics constraint provided for a final state with `T=0`. The sum `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` is even, whereas the rule requires it to be odd.\n\n*   **Option D (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`) is not permitted** because it violates Rule 4. The final state `7D1` requires the two-nucleon system to have a total spin of `S=3`, which is physically impossible.\n\nSince the question asks for a single forbidden partial wave, we must discern the intended answer. The problem explicitly directs us to use the conservation laws and the provided Pauli statistics relation. Option C is forbidden because it directly fails one of these specific selection rules governing the *process*. The problem with Option D is more fundamental; the proposed final *product* is impossible, regardless of the process. In the context of this type of physics question, the intended answer is the one that fails the specific test of the selection rules that were laid out.\n\nTherefore, the partial wave `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the one that is not permitted based on the specific conditions of the problem.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Initial State and Identify the Governing Rules\n\nFirst, we analyze the initial state and derive the selection rules that any permitted transition must obey.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system starts as two nucleons (NN) in a **1S0** state. The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us its quantum numbers:\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` → Initial Total Spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` → Initial Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` → Initial Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The initial parity is `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Reaction Rules:** The transition `1S0 → NN_f + X` must follow these rules:\n\n    1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The initial `J_i=0`. The final total angular momentum (`J_f` from the final NN state and `l_X` from the particle X, assuming it is spinless) must also couple to zero. This requires their magnitudes to be equal:\n        `J_f = l_X`\n\n    2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The initial parity (`+1`) must equal the final parity. The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`. For `P_i = P_f`, we need `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`, which requires `L_f + l_X` to be **odd**.\n\n    3.  **Pauli Statistics Constraint:** The problem provides the rule for the final state `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Given `T_f = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`, which requires `S_f + L_f` to be **odd**.\n\n    4.  **Physicality of the Final State:** Two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` (singlet, `2S+1=1`) or `S=1` (triplet, `2S+1=3`). Any state with a different total spin (e.g., `S=3`) is physically impossible.\n\n### Step 2: Systematically Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe now test each proposed reaction against these four rules. A reaction is \"not permitted\" if it fails any one of them. The options are:\nA) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s\nB) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f\nC) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p\nD) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p\n\n| Option | Reaction               | Decoded State `(S_f, L_f, J_f)` + `l_X` | J-Conservation `J_f=l_X`? | Parity `L_f+l_X` odd? | Pauli `S_f+L_f` odd? | Physical State `S=0,1`? | Verdict         |\n| :----: | :--------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :---------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------ | :-------------- |\n| A)     | 1S0 -> 3P0 + s         | `(1, 1, 0) + 0`                     | `0=0` (OK)                    | `1+0=1` (OK)            | `1+1=2` (**FAIL**)     | `S=1` (OK)                | **Not Permitted** |\n| B)     | 1S0 -> 3D3 + f         | `(1, 2, 3) + 3`                     | `3=3` (OK)                    | `2+3=5` (OK)            | `1+2=3` (OK)            | `S=1` (OK)                | Permitted       |\n| C)     | 1S0 -> 7D1 + p         | `(3, 2, 1) + 1`                     | `1=1` (OK)                    | `2+1=3` (OK)            | `3+2=5` (OK)            | `S=3` (**FAIL**)      | **Not Permitted** |\n| D)     | 1S0 -> 3S1 + p         | `(1, 0, 1) + 1`                     | `1=1` (OK)                    | `0+1=1` (OK)            | `1+0=1` (OK)            | `S=1` (OK)                | Permitted       |\n\n### Step 3: Final Decision\n\nThe analysis reveals two forbidden reactions:\n\n*   **A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s:** This transition is forbidden because it violates the explicit Pauli statistics rule (`S_f + L_f` must be odd) provided in the problem for a final state with `T=0`.\n\n*   **C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p:** This transition is forbidden for a more fundamental reason: the final product state `7D1` requires a total spin `S=3`, which is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\nThe question asks us to identify the forbidden partial wave by making use of the specified conservation laws and the Pauli statistics rule. Option A is the reaction that is disallowed specifically by one of these enumerated rules governing the *process*. Option C is disallowed because the *product* itself is impossible.
