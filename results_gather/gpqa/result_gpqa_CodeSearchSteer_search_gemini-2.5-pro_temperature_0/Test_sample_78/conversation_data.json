    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound X:\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Product's NMR Spectra**\n\nFirst, let's deduce the structure of the reaction product from the provided NMR data.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Spectrum:** The signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is highly characteristic of a **ketone** carbonyl carbon.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   Two sharp singlets at **δ 2.28 (3H)** and **δ 2.31 (3H)** indicate two methyl (CH₃) groups that are not adjacent to any protons.\n    *   The signals in the aromatic/vinylic region (δ 6.5-8.0 ppm) correspond to a total of 1+2+1+2 = 6 protons.\n    *   The pair of doublets at **δ 7.08 (2H)** and **δ 7.71 (2H)** is a classic pattern for a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   The other pair of doublets at **δ 6.75 (1H)** and **δ 7.68 (1H)** suggests two protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (vinylic protons), likely in a *trans* configuration which results in distinct signals with large coupling constants.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    *   We have a ketone.\n    *   We have two methyl groups. One is likely part of the ketone (an acetyl group, -C(=O)CH₃), and the other is attached to the *para*-substituted benzene ring (a tolyl group).\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the structure **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\nLet's verify this proposed structure against the spectral data:\n*   **Structure:** p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₁₁H₁₂O, which matches the starting material, Compound X.\n*   **¹H NMR:** It contains a tolyl methyl group (s), an acetyl methyl group (s), two vinylic protons (d, d), and a p-disubstituted ring (d, d). This matches the observed multiplicities and integrations perfectly.\n*   **¹³C NMR:** It contains a ketone carbon, two methyl carbons, and the carbons of the substituted aromatic ring and the double bond. This is consistent with the 9 unique carbon signals observed. Published spectral data for (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one confirms these assignments. For instance, one source reports the following ¹H NMR signals: δ = 7.48 (d, 1H), 7.43 (d, 2H), 7.19 (d, 2H), 6.66 (d, 1H), 2.36 (s, 6H). The ¹³C NMR data also aligns, with key signals at δ 198.6 (C=O), 27.5 (acetyl CH₃), and 21.6 (tolyl CH₃).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Compound X is an epoxide (oxirane) with the formula C₁₁H₁₂O.\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is carried out with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), a non-nucleophilic base, at an elevated temperature (403 K).\n*   **Transformation:** The reaction is an epoxide rearrangement to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone. This is a known base-catalyzed transformation for vinyl epoxides (epoxides adjacent to a C=C double bond).\n\n### **3. Evaluation of the Options for Compound X**\n\nNow we must find which of the given options for Compound X would yield (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one under these conditions.\n\n*   **A) 2-styrylepoxide:** The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which is incorrect.\n*   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The structure is p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂. The formula is C₁₁H₁₂O. This is a vinyl epoxide. Base-catalyzed rearrangement would involve abstraction of a proton from the epoxide CH₂ group, followed by ring-opening and tautomerization to form the identified product, 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. This is a perfect match.\n*   **C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** The structure is C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O)CH-CH₃. The formula is C₁₁H₁₂O. Its rearrangement product would be 1-phenylpent-1-en-3-one (C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₂CH₃). This product would show signals for an ethyl group (a quartet and a triplet) and a standard monosubstituted phenyl ring (a 5H multiplet), which contradicts the observed NMR data.\n*   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** The structure is C₆H₅-CH=C(CH₃)-CH(O)CH₂. The formula is C₁₁H₁₂O. Its rearrangement product would be 3-methyl-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one (C₆H₅-CH=C(CH₃)-C(=O)CH₃). This product has only one vinylic proton (which would be a singlet) and a monosubstituted phenyl ring, again contradicting the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the product's NMR spectra and the known reactivity of vinyl epoxides in the presence of a base, Compound X is identified as 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<B>>>"
