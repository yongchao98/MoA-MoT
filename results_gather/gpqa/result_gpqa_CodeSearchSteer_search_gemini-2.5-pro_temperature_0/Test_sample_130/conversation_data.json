    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   The dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride is maleic acid. The resulting anhydride is maleic anhydride. The NMR data (¹H: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is consistent with the symmetric structure of maleic anhydride.\n    *   The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition, a [4+2] reaction that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n2.  **Determine the Products (Stereoisomers):**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* product.\n    *   The *endo* product is typically the major product because it is formed faster (kinetic control), due to favorable secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n    *   The *exo* product is generally more stable (thermodynamic product) because it is less sterically hindered, but it forms more slowly.\n    *   Since the problem states a major and a minor product are formed, we can identify the major product as the *endo* isomer and the minor product as the *exo* isomer.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structures of the *Endo* and *Exo* Products:**\n    *   The reaction creates a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   There are four methyl groups: two on the bridgehead carbons (let's call them **Me-bridgehead**) and two on the double bond of the new six-membered ring (let's call them **Me-alkene**).\n    *   There are two equivalent protons where the anhydride ring is fused to the bicyclic system (let's call them **H-anhydride**).\n    *   **In the *endo* isomer (major product):** The anhydride ring is tucked under the diene system, on the same side as the newly formed double bond. This places the **H-anhydride** protons in close spatial proximity to the **Me-alkene** groups.\n    *   **In the *exo* isomer (minor product):** The anhydride ring points away from the diene system. This places the **H-anhydride** protons far from the **Me-alkene** groups but close to the **Me-bridgehead** groups.\n\n4.  **Interpret the 2D NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   2D NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent or weak in the minor product.\n    *   This specific cross-peak must correspond to an interaction unique to the *endo* (major) isomer. Based on our structural analysis, this is the interaction between the **H-anhydride** protons and the **Me-alkene** protons.\n\n5.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   We need to assign the chemical shifts and integrals given in the options to the protons in our structure.\n    *   **H-anhydride:** These are two equivalent methine protons, each adjacent to a carbonyl group in a strained ring system. They will be deshielded. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** and an integral of **2H** (as a singlet due to symmetry) is a reasonable assignment.\n    *   **Me-alkene:** These are two equivalent methyl groups attached to a double bond (vinylic methyls). They are deshielded compared to standard alkyl methyls. A chemical shift of **~1.7 ppm** and an integral of **6H** (as a singlet) is a good estimate.\n    *   **Me-bridgehead:** These are two equivalent methyl groups on saturated bridgehead carbons. They are in a more shielded environment. A chemical shift of **~1.0 ppm** and an integral of **6H** (as a singlet) is expected.\n\n6.  **Match the Analysis to the Options:**\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects the **H-anhydride** protons and the **Me-alkene** protons.\n    *   Based on our assignments, this corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\n    *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect integration and multiplicity for the methyl signal.\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect signal for the anhydride protons.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This correctly identifies the alkene methyls and the anhydride protons, which are close in space in the major (*endo*) product.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This would be a cross-peak between the two different sets of methyl groups.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the resonances of the alkene methyl groups and the anhydride bridgehead protons.\n\n<<<C>>>"
