    "To determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry, we must analyze the symmetry elements of each molecule. A molecule with C3h symmetry possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis.\n\n*   **A) Quinuclidine (C7H13N):** This is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure. It has a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon-hydrogen group. However, it does not have a mirror plane perpendicular to this axis. Instead, it has three vertical mirror planes that contain the C3 axis, giving it a **C3v** point group.\n\n*   **B) Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:** This molecule, also known as mellitic trianhydride, consists of a central benzene ring fused to three anhydride rings. Due to steric strain, the molecule is non-planar and adopts a propeller-like shape. This structure has a C3 axis but lacks a horizontal mirror plane. It possesses three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, placing it in the **D3** point group.\n\n*   **C) Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:** Similar to mellitic trianhydride, this molecule is based on a larger triphenylene core. Triphenylene itself is planar and has D3h symmetry. However, the fusion of the three anhydride rings is expected to cause similar steric strain as in mellitic trianhydride, leading to a non-planar, propeller-shaped molecule with **D3** symmetry. If it were planar, its point group would be D3h, not C3h.\n\n*   **D) Triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3):** This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar. A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane. For the molecule to have C3h symmetry, a horizontal mirror plane (σh) must exist, which would coincide with the B(O)3 plane. This requires the three isopropyl groups to be arranged such that for every atom above the plane, an identical atom exists in a corresponding position below it. This can be achieved in an idealized conformation where the central carbon of each isopropyl group lies in the plane, with one methyl group positioned above the plane and the other below it. While the lowest energy conformation is likely a C3 propeller due to steric hindrance, the idealized conformation that possesses a horizontal mirror plane belongs to the **C3h** point group. This is analogous to boric acid, B(OH)3, which is a well-known example of a C3h molecule.\n\nBased on the analysis, the other molecules belong to C3v or D3 point groups. Triisopropyl borate is the only molecule that can adopt a conformation with C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>"
