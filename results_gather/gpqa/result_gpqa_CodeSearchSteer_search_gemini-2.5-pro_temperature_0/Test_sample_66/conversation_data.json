    "To determine the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of the orbital angular momentum components L₁z and L₂z, we must analyze the given quantum state.\n\n### 1. Understand the System and State\n*   **System:** Two electrons in a p orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are `l₁ = 1` and `l₂ = 1`.\n*   **State:** The system is in the coupled angular momentum state `|l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n    *   `l = 2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n    *   `m = -1` is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum. The eigenvalue of the total Lz is `mħ = -ħ`.\n\n### 2. The Measurement and Desired Outcome\n*   **Measurement:** The z-components of the individual angular momenta, L₁z and L₂z, are measured.\n*   **Desired Outcome:** We want to find the probability of getting an eigenvalue of -ħ for L₁z *and* an eigenvalue of -ħ for L₂z.\n    *   An eigenvalue of -ħ for L₁z corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number `m₁ = -1`.\n    *   An eigenvalue of -ħ for L₂z corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number `m₂ = -1`.\n\n### 3. The Conservation of Angular Momentum\nA fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed by the quantum number relationship:\n`m = m₁ + m₂`\n\nThis rule acts as a selection rule: a coupled state `|l, m>` can only be composed of uncoupled states `|l₁, m₁>|l₂, m₂>` where the individual magnetic quantum numbers sum to the total magnetic quantum number.\n\n### 4. Applying the Rule to the Problem\n*   The system is in a state with a total magnetic quantum number `m = -1`.\n*   The measurement outcome we are interested in is `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n*   Let's check if this outcome is compatible with the state of the system:\n    `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n\nSince the sum of the desired individual quantum numbers (`-2`) does not equal the total quantum number of the system (`-1`), it is impossible to obtain this measurement outcome.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe probability of measuring an outcome that violates the conservation of angular momentum is zero. The coupled state `|1, 1, 2, -1>` is a superposition of states where `m₁ + m₂ = -1` (specifically, a combination of `|m₁=0, m₂=-1>` and `|m₁=-1, m₂=0>`). The state `|m₁=-1, m₂=-1>` is not a component of the given state `|1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both L₁z and L₂z as -ħ is 0.\n\n<<<D>>>"
