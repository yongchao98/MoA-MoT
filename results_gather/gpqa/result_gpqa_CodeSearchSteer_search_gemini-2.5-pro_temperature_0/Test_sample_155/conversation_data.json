    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a *trans*-alkene, (E)-oct-4-ene, with mCPBA results in a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom. This means the oxygen adds to the same face of the double bond. Since the starting alkene is symmetrical and achiral, this reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an *anti*-addition, meaning the incoming nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   The ring-opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The ring-opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1:** The resulting product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has two stereocenters but possesses an internal plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a *cis*-alkene, (Z)-oct-4-ene, with mCPBA is also a *syn*-addition. Because the starting material is a symmetrical *cis*-alkene, this reaction forms a single, achiral meso epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this meso-epoxide is an *anti*-addition. The nucleophilic attack by water can occur with equal probability at either of the two carbons of the epoxide.\n    *   Attack at one carbon produces (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon produces (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2:** The products are a pair of enantiomers. Since they are formed in equal amounts, the result is a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the product from Reaction 1 (the meso compound) with the products from Reaction 2 (the racemic mixture of two enantiomers). The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (meso compound)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer 1)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers, however, have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral chromatography. The meso compound will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Consequently, the chemist will observe **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will have different retention times and will appear as two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a distinct retention time and will be separated from them.\n    *   Consequently, the chemist will observe **3 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the standard HPLC will show 2 peaks, and the chiral HPLC will show 3 peaks.\n\n<<<C>>>"
