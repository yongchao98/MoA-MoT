    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻), we must first calculate the concentrations of the buffer components and the pH of the solution.\n\n**1. Calculate Molar Amounts and Concentrations**\n\n*   **Volume of the solution:** 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n*   **KH₂PO₄ (provides H₂PO₄⁻, the acid component):**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Concentration [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   **Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (provides HPO₄²⁻, the base component):**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   Concentration [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**2. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]**\n\nThe solution is a buffer composed of the conjugate acid-base pair H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻. This corresponds to the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄), governed by Ka₂.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   **Equilibrium constant:** Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n\nWe can find the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] using the Ka₂ expression:\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nRearranging for [H⁺]:\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * 1.308\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**3. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]**\n\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, which involves the deprotonation of HPO₄²⁻.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   **Equilibrium constant:** Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n\nThe equilibrium expression for this reaction is:\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe can now solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻], using the values we have for [H⁺] and [HPO₄²⁻]. Because Ka₃ is very small, we can assume the equilibrium concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] is the same as its initial concentration.\n\nRearranging for [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis value is closest to 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<D>>>"
