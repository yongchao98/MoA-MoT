    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after being diluted with water.\n\n*   **Initial Concentration (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Final Concentration (M₂):** Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\nThe concentration of the acetic acid to be titrated is 0.025 M.\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), by the NaOH. This creates a buffer solution. The pH of a buffer is best calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** pH = pKa + log ( [A⁻] / [HA] )\n*   **Ka of acetic acid:** 1.85x10⁻⁵\n*   **pKa:** -log(Ka) = -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   **Ratio at 25% titration:** The ratio of the conjugate base to the acid, [A⁻]/[HA], is 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n*   **pH Calculation:**\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ **4.26**\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate. The solution now contains only the weak base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), which hydrolyzes water, producing OH⁻ ions and making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Moles of Acetic Acid:**\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n*   **Volume of NaOH needed:**\n    At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid.\n    Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total Volume at Equivalence Point:**\n    40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   **Concentration of Acetate ([A⁻]):**\n    [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n*   **Calculate Kb for Acetate:**\n    The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   **Calculate [OH⁻] from Hydrolysis:**\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02)\n    x² = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 ≈ **8.52**\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<D>>>"
