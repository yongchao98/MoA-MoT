    "When solving parabolic partial differential equations, such as the heat equation, a common technique is to first discretize the spatial variables, which transforms the partial differential equation into a large system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The solution to this system involves a matrix exponential function. For computational purposes, this exponential function is often replaced by a rational approximation, like a Pad√© or Chebyshev approximation.\n\nThe key to converting the sequential calculation into a parallel one lies in the mathematical properties of this rational approximation. Specifically, the ability to decompose the rational function into a sum of simpler terms through a partial fraction expansion is the critical step.\n\nHere's why this is the key factor:\n*   **Decomposition into Independent Tasks**: A rational approximation of the matrix exponential can be broken down into a sum of simple linear fractions.\n*   **Solving Linear Systems in Parallel**: Each of these fractions corresponds to solving a linear system of equations. Crucially, these systems are independent of one another.\n*   **Parallel Execution**: Because the tasks are independent, they can be distributed among multiple processors to be solved simultaneously. This process transforms a sequential problem into a highly parallel one, significantly speeding up computation time.\n\nTherefore, the linear partial fraction expansion of the fractional approximation is the essential technique that enables the algorithm to be parallelized.\n\n<<<A>>>"
