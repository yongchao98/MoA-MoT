    "To solve this problem, we must first identify the initial and final states of the molecule and then calculate the energy difference, which corresponds to the energy of the absorbed photon. Finally, we can determine the photon's momentum.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Molecular Transition\n\n*   **Model:** The molecule is described by the quantum rotation-vibration model. Its energy levels are given by the formula:\n    E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J+1)\n    where `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2,...), `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2,...), `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `ω` is the vibrational angular frequency, and `B` is the rotational constant.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state, which corresponds to the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum: v = 0 and J = 0.\n\n*   **Final State and Selection Rules:** A photon is absorbed, causing a transition to a higher energy state. For a diatomic molecule, the selection rules for such a rovibrational transition are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. Since the molecule starts at J=0, the change in the rotational quantum number must be ΔJ = +1. Therefore, the transition occurs from the initial state (v=0, J=0) to the final state (v=1, J=1). This is the lowest possible energy transition that involves a change in the vibrational state.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Photon's Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon is the difference between the final and initial energy states:\nΔE = E(v=1, J=1) - E(v=0, J=0)\n\nUsing the energy level formula:\n*   E_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B(1)(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n*   E_initial = E(0, 0) = (0 + 1/2)ħω + B(0)(0+1) = (1/2)ħω\n\nThe energy difference is:\nΔE = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - (1/2)ħω = ħω + 2B\n\nTo calculate this value, we need to find the rotational constant `B`.\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n    μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.8182 amu\n    Converting to kg: μ ≈ 1.8182 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μR²\n    I = (3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n*   **Rotational Constant (B):**\n    B = ħ² / (2I)\n    B = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 4.604 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n*   **Vibrational Energy (ħω):**\n    ħω = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n*   **Total Energy Difference (ΔE):**\n    ΔE = (4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + 2 * (4.604 x 10⁻²³ J)\n    ΔE ≈ 4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.00092 x 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.2184 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n    (Note: The rotational energy contribution is very small compared to the vibrational energy).\n\n### 3. Calculating the Photon's Momentum (p)\n\nThe momentum of a photon is related to its energy by the equation p = E / c.\n\n*   **Momentum Calculation:**\n    p = ΔE / c\n    p = (4.2184 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.9979 x 10⁸ m/s)\n    p ≈ 1.407 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis calculated value is approximately 1.4 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the calculated momentum with the given options:\nA) p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s\nB) p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s\nC) p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s\nD) p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
