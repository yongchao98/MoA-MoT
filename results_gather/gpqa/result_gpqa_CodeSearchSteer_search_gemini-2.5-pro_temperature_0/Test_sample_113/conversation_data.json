    "### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a classic example of a **cyanohydrin formation**. The process involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide (NaCN) to the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This attack forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate. For the reaction to be completed and to form the final product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, this alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to create the hydroxyl (-OH) group. Reagent **A** must therefore be a proton source. An acidic workup, represented by H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion), is a standard method to achieve this protonation.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is known as **nitrile hydrolysis**. The reaction can be catalyzed by either acid or base. In acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, the nitrile is typically heated with a strong aqueous acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid. The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid. Since the final product is the carboxylic acid itself and not its salt, direct acid catalysis is a very common and effective method. Therefore, reagent **B** is a strong acid like HCl. While acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is an acid, it is a weak acid and generally not effective for this hydrolysis.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   For the first reaction (cyanohydrin formation), reagent **A** is an acid source for the final protonation step, making **H₃O⁺** a suitable choice.\n*   For the second reaction (nitrile hydrolysis), reagent **B** is a strong acid catalyst, making **HCl** the appropriate choice.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct combination of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<B>>>"
