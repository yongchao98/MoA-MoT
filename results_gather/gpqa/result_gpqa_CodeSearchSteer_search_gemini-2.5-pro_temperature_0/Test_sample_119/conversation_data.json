    "To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with parallax, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Assume a uniform star distribution.** This means the number of stars per unit volume (let's call this density, ρ) is constant everywhere in space.\n\n2.  **Consider the number of stars at a certain distance.** The number of stars (dN) in a thin spherical shell with radius *d* and thickness *dd* is the volume of that shell multiplied by the star density. The volume of the shell is approximately its surface area (4πd²) times its thickness (dd).\n    *   dN = ρ * (4πd²) * dd\n\n3.  **Relate distance to parallax.** Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (d). For simplicity, using the definition of a parsec, the relationship is:\n    *   d = 1/plx\n\n4.  **Express the change in distance (dd) in terms of the change in parallax (d(plx)).** We can find this by taking the derivative of the distance equation with respect to parallax:\n    *   dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²\n    *   Therefore, dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx). The negative sign simply indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For counting stars, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can use |dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx).\n\n5.  **Substitute the parallax expressions back into the equation for the number of stars.** Now, we replace *d* and *dd* in the equation from step 2 with their parallax equivalents from steps 3 and 4.\n    *   dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)\n    *   Simplifying this gives: dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)\n\n6.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax.** We want to find the expression for dN/d(plx), which represents how the number of stars changes per unit of parallax.\n    *   dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴\n\nSince 4, π, and ρ are all constants, the relationship shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. This relationship is noted in astronomical contexts, such as in the discussion of the Lutz-Kelker bias.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax as ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<D>>>"
