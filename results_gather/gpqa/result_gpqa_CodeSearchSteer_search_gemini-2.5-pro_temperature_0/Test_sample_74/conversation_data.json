  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "An analysis of the provided DNA sequence reveals the reason for the failed protein expression.\n\nThe sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the correct start codon for translation. This is followed by the sequence `TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC`, which correctly codes for the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA. This corresponds to the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag, as intended in the experimental design.\n\nHowever, immediately following the HA tag sequence and one additional codon (`AAA`, coding for Lysine), the sequence contains the triplet `TGA`. In the standard genetic code, `TGA` is a stop codon (also known as an opal or umber codon). When the ribosome encounters this codon during translation, it terminates the synthesis of the polypeptide chain. Consequently, only a very short peptide containing the HA tag is produced, and the main GADD45G protein is never translated.\n\nEvaluating the given options:\n*   **A) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** This is incorrect. Proteolysis is the degradation of a protein, but the primary issue here is that the full-length protein is not being synthesized in the first place due to premature termination.\n*   **B) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** This is incorrect. The DNA sequence for the HA tag is correct and does not contain mutations that would alter its amino acid sequence.\n*   **C) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is the correct explanation. The presence of the premature `TGA` stop codon halts translation immediately after the tag, preventing the expression of the GADD45G protein.\n*   **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This statement is incorrect for two reasons. First, the stop codon in the sequence is `TGA`, not `TAA` (`UAA` in mRNA). Second, stop codons are not recognized by tRNAs; they are recognized by protein release factors that terminate translation.\n\nTherefore, the failure to overexpress the protein is due to the early termination of translation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
