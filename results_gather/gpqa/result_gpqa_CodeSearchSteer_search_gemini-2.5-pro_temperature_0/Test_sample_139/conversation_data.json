    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical puzzle to determine Substance X and calculate the required atomic masses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Identification\n\n1.  **Substance B**: The melting point of substance B is stated to be \"very close to 277 K\". The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K, which is approximately 3.82°C. This is remarkably close to 277 K, strongly suggesting that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0°C), which is not as close.\n\n2.  **Precipitate G**: Precipitate G, when heated, releases substance B (D₂O). This indicates that G is a deuterated hydroxide, which decomposes upon heating to form a metal oxide and heavy water. A plausible candidate for such a precipitate is aluminum hydroxide's deuterated analog, **Al(OD)₃**. Upon heating, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n\n3.  **Substance X and its Reaction**: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W and precipitate G.\n    *   **Gas W**: The problem states that the molecules of gas W have an equal number of protons and neutrons. Deuterium gas (**D₂**) fits this description perfectly. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Substance X**: A reagent used in organic chemistry that contains a heavier isotope and reacts to form the products identified above is **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. It is a powerful reducing agent and a close analog of the very common Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   **Liquid Y**: For the reaction to produce D₂ gas, LiAlD₄ would need to react with a source of deuterium, making **heavy water (D₂O)** the logical identity for liquid Y.\n    *   **The Reaction**: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate G) + 4D₂ (gas W). This reaction is known to be violent, similar to the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water.\n\n4.  **Confirmation with Keto Acid Reaction**: The problem states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, totaling 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that would reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol (-CD(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol (-CD₂(OH)). The resulting product, a diol, would contain 2 oxygen atoms, which is consistent with the clue.\n\n### Calculation\n\nHaving confidently identified Substance X as **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, we can proceed with the calculation.\n\n1.  **Elements in Substance X**: The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its heavier isotope, Deuterium, D).\n\n2.  **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**:\n    *   Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (Z=13).\n\n3.  **Sum of Atomic Masses**: The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule, summing all isotopes of each. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation as implied by the answer choices.\n    *   **Mass of the Lightest Element (Hydrogen)**: There are four atoms of the Deuterium (²H) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Mass of the Heaviest Element (Aluminum)**: There is one atom of Aluminum. The most common and stable isotope is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n\n4.  **Cumulative Sum**:\n    *   Sum = (Mass of all Deuterium atoms) + (Mass of all Aluminum atoms)\n    *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>"
