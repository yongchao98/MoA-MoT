    "The reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. The number of possible organic products can be determined by analyzing the steps of the mechanism.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the carbon bearing the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n*   **C6**, which has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n*   **C2**, which has a deuterium (D) atom.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, a C-H bond is broken more easily and quickly than a C-D bond. However, both abstractions are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains, resulting in **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule, resulting in **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide anion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking either carbon of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   Attack at C1 leads to the formation of **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 leads to the formation of **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   Attack at either C1 or C2 of the symmetrical benzyne intermediate leads to the formation of a single product: **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the possible products from both pathways, we find three distinct organic molecules:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
