    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The presence of a peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of about 32% (approximately a 3:1 ratio with the M+ peak) is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom. This is due to the natural abundance of the chlorine isotopes ³⁵Cl (about 75%) and ³⁷Cl (about 25%).\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this signal corresponds to the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic indicator of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The two different chemical shifts arise because the two substituents on the ring are different, making the chemically equivalent protons on each side of the ring magnetically distinct.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** The molecular weight (156.57 g/mol) is correct. However, its structure lacks a carboxylic acid group, so it would not show the characteristic broad O-H peak in the IR spectrum or the -COOH proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule's molecular weight is 156.57 g/mol, and it contains one chlorine atom, matching the MS data. As a carboxylic acid, its IR and ¹H NMR spectra would show the expected broad O-H stretch and the downfield -COOH proton signal, respectively. The *para* substitution pattern perfectly matches the two doublets seen in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** While the molecular weight is correct (156.57 g/mol), this compound is an aldehyde with a phenol group. It would not have a carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm. Its aromatic ¹H NMR spectrum would be more complex, showing three distinct protons, not a simple two-doublet pattern.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This compound is a carboxylic acid with the correct molecular weight (156.57 g/mol). It would fit the IR and the carboxylic acid portion of the NMR data. However, the *ortho* substitution would result in a complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region with four unique proton signals, which contradicts the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectral data—a molecular weight of 156 with one chlorine atom, the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, and a *para*-substituted aromatic ring—unequivocally points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown white solid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
