    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule from its condensed formula: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n\nLet's break down the formula and draw the structure to count the atoms and bonds.\nThe structure is a main chain with several methyl group substituents.\nThe main chain is `C=C-C-C-C-C=C`, which is a heptadiene (7 carbons).\n*   The first carbon `(C1)` is double-bonded to `C2` and has two methyl groups attached: `(CH3)2C1=`.\n*   The chain continues with `=C2H-C3H2-`.\n*   The fourth carbon `(C4)` has a methyl group: `-C4H(CH3)-`.\n*   The chain continues with `-C5H2-C6H=`.\n*   The last carbon `(C7)` is double-bonded to `C6` and has two methyl groups attached: `=C7(CH3)2`.\n\nThe full structure is 2,4,7,7-tetramethylhepta-1,5-diene. Wait, let's re-check the name from the formula `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\nThe correct IUPAC name for the structure derived is 2,5,8,8-tetramethylnona-2,7-diene.\n\nLet's count the atoms based on the valid chemical structure:\n*   **Carbons (C):** There are 7 carbons in the main chain and 5 methyl groups attached. This gives a total of 7 + 5 = 12 carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):**\n    *   From `(CH3)2C=`: 6 H\n    *   From `=CH-`: 1 H\n    *   From `-CH2-`: 2 H\n    *   From `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 H in the chain + 3 H in the methyl group = 4 H\n    *   From `-CH2-`: 2 H\n    *   From `-CH=`: 1 H\n    *   From `=C(CH3)2`: 6 H\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nFrom the structure, we can count the bonds:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds in the structure (`C=C`). So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** In an acyclic molecule with 12 carbons, there are a total of 11 bonds between carbon atoms. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds. 11 - 2 = 9. So, there are **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atom, compound)**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound.\nΔH_atom, compound = (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H))\nUsing the given bond energies (BE):\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atom, compound = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\nΔH_atom, compound = 1800 + 600 + 8800\nΔH_atom, compound = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements (ΔH_atom, elements)**\n\nThis is the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard states. The formation reaction is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol × ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of H2 gas: 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\nTotal ΔH_atom, elements = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy required to atomize the compound.\nΔH_f = ΔH_atom, elements - ΔH_atom, compound\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔH_f = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Convert Units to Match the Options**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/g and kJ/mol. Our calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's convert this to kJ/g.\nFirst, we need the molar mass of C12H22.\nMolar Mass (M) = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / M (g/mol)\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 1900 kJ/g (Incorrect unit)\nB) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not formation)\nC) 11.44 kJ/g (This matches our calculation)\nD) 67.4 kJ/mol (Incorrect value)\n\nThe correct answer is 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<C>>>"
