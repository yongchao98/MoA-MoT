    "To determine which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze the effect of each mutation on the gene's protein product. The goal is to find the mutation most likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n\nThe intact gene sequence begins with `5’-ATG TTT CTC...`, where `ATG` is the start codon. The protein synthesis starts here.\n\nLet's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC...`\n    *   Compared to the intact gene (`ATG TTT CTC`), the second codon `TTT` has changed to `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for the amino acid Phenylalanine, making this a **silent mutation** with no effect on the protein sequence.\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. A missense mutation might alter or even eliminate protein function, but it is not guaranteed. The effect depends on the importance of that specific amino acid to the protein's structure and function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA...`\n    *   The second codon change (`TTT` to `TTC`) is a silent mutation, as in Mutant 1.\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely, resulting in a very short, truncated protein (in this case, only two amino acids long). A truncated protein is almost always non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n    *   This sequence appears to have multiple single-base changes compared to the intact gene. However, a closer look at the sequence `ATGTTT**T**ACG...` reveals an insertion of a single nucleotide (`T`) after the second codon.\n    *   An insertion of a number of bases not divisible by three causes a **frameshift mutation**. This alters the three-base-pair reading frame for all subsequent codons, leading to a completely different and usually non-functional amino acid sequence, which often ends in a premature stop codon. Like a nonsense mutation, a frameshift mutation is very likely to eliminate protein function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n    *   This sequence is difficult to interpret as a single, simple mutational event like those typically caused by EMS. It appears to involve multiple substitutions or a combination of a substitution and a deletion. For instance, if we assume the `GGT` codon was deleted and the `CTC` codon was changed to `TAC`, this would be a complex mutation. An in-frame deletion (of 3 bases) would remove an amino acid, which may or may not eliminate function, while a missense mutation has an uncertain effect. Due to its complexity and ambiguity, it is a less likely candidate.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth a nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) and a frameshift mutation (Mutant 3) are highly likely to result in a complete loss of protein function. However, the problem states that the mutants were generated using EMS. EMS is a chemical mutagen that primarily causes point mutations (substitutions), particularly G:C to A:T transitions, and is less likely to cause insertions or deletions.\n\n*   The change in **Mutant 2** (`CTC` to `TAA`) is a point mutation (a substitution).\n*   The change in **Mutant 3** is an insertion.\n\nGiven that EMS was used, a point mutation is a more probable event than an insertion. The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is a point mutation that is virtually guaranteed to eliminate the protein's function by creating a severely truncated product. Therefore, it is the most probable mutation to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n<<<D>>>"
