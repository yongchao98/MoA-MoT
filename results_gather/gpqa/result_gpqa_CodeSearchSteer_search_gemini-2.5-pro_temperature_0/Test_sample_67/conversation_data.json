    "The physical phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment, such as that of a spin-1/2 particle, is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the situation:\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):** The particle's magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in a \"spin-up\" state with respect to the Z-axis.\n\n2.  **Change of Field (t = 0):** The magnetic field is instantaneously switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`.\n\n3.  **Precession (t > 0):** The magnetic moment, which was initially pointing along the Z-axis, will begin to precess around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis). This precession occurs in the X-Z plane.\n\n4.  **Oscillation of the Z-Component:** As the magnetic moment vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will change over time. This projection will oscillate between its initial maximum value, through zero, to a minimum value, and back.\n\nThe angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω`, which is given by the formula:\n\n`ω = γB`\n\nwhere:\n*   `γ` (gamma) is the gyromagnetic ratio of the particle.\n*   `B` is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nThis frequency `ω` is precisely the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment. The search results confirm that for a spin in a magnetic field, the precession frequency is `γB`. This is a standard result in quantum mechanics and magnetic resonance. The expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<Sz>`, can be calculated to be proportional to `cos(γBt)`, which explicitly shows an oscillation with angular frequency `γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
