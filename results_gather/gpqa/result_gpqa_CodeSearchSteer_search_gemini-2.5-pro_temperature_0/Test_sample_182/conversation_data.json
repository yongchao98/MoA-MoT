    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first identify the starting material and the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Starting Material and its Molecular Formula\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's determine its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene ring**: A six-membered ring with one double bond.\n*   **Substituents**:\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1.\n    *   A formyl group (-CHO) at position 2.\n    *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) at position 5.\n\nThe molecular formula of this compound is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\n### 2. The Reaction and the Product\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is known to reduce various functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes.\n\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The **carbon-carbon double bond** in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n*   The **carbon-carbon double bond** in the vinyl group is reduced to a single bond, converting the vinyl group into an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe reaction removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all double bonds, leaving a saturated hydrocarbon with the same carbon skeleton. The starting molecule has a 10-carbon skeleton (a 6-carbon ring with three substituents containing a total of 4 carbons).\n\nThe resulting product is a substituted cyclohexane: **4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**.\n\n### 3. Molecular Formula of the Product\n\nThe product, 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, is a saturated cycloalkane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. Since the carbon skeleton has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for calculating IHD for a hydrocarbon (CₓHᵧ) is:\n\nIHD = (2x + 2 - y) / 2\n\nFor the product C₁₀H₂₀:\n*   x = 10 (number of carbon atoms)\n*   y = 20 (number of hydrogen atoms)\n\nIHD = (2 * 10 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = (20 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = 2 / 2\nIHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure of the cyclohexane molecule.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
