    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Gaseous Products\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze the weight change of each tube to identify the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Weight increase = mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ **0.2 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change.\n    *   This indicates that **no CO₂** or other acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The weight increase is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ produced = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2 * 16.00 = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all the tubes, a gas C remains.\n    *   Volume of gas C = 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.1 mol**.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, an alkaline solution, or hot copper. This suggests it is a relatively inert gas, most likely nitrogen (N₂), which is a common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n### 2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts\n\nNow, let's determine the mass and moles of each element (N, H, O) in the original 7.20 g mixture by looking at the atoms in the products.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.2 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.2 mol = **0.4 mol**.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** Assuming gas C is N₂.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.1 mol = **0.2 mol**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.2 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.2 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol**.\n\nLet's verify the total mass from these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.4 mol H × 1.008 g/mol) + (0.2 mol N × 14.007 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.00 g/mol)\n*   Mass ≈ 0.4032 g + 2.8014 g + 4.00 g = 7.2046 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g), confirming our calculations and the identity of gas C as N₂.\n\n### 3. Identify Salts A and B\n\nThe problem states we have an **equimolar mixture** of two salts, A and B. This means if we have 'n' moles of salt A, we also have 'n' moles of salt B. The total amount of the mixture contains 0.2 mol N, 0.4 mol H, and 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe ratio of the atoms in the combined formula unit of (A + B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25\nTo get an integer ratio, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nSo, the combined empirical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe salts are decomposition products containing N, H, and O, which strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions (like nitrate or nitrite). Let's try to find two such salts that sum to the formula N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** The chemical formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** The chemical formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n\nLet's add their formulas together:\n(N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A = Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   **Salt B = Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂ or N₂H₄O₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃ or N₂H₄O₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
