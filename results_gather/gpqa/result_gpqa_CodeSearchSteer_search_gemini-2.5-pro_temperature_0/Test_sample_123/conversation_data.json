    "To determine the required Lorentz factor, we can use the principles of special relativity applied to particle decay.\n\n### Analysis of the Physics\n\nThe number of particles, N, that survive after a time *t* in the laboratory frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n\nN = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_lab)\n\nWhere:\n*   **N₀** is the initial number of particles.\n*   **t** is the time elapsed in the laboratory frame.\n*   **τ_lab** is the average lifetime of the particles in the laboratory frame.\n\nDue to time dilation, the lifetime of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is longer in the lab frame than its proper lifetime (τ_proper), which is its lifetime in its own rest frame. The relationship is given by:\n\nτ_lab = γ * τ_proper\n\nwhere **γ** is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe particles are created at the center of a spherical detector with a radius **R** of 30 meters. Since they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed *v* is approximately the speed of light, *c*. The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is:\n\nt ≈ R / c\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, we get the fraction of particles that reach the detector:\n\nN/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))\n\nThis can be simplified to:\n\nN/N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * cτ_proper))\n\nThe term `cτ_proper` is a constant for a specific type of particle, representing its proper decay length.\n\n### Calculation\n\nLet's set up equations for the two scenarios given in the problem.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₁) = 20\n*   Fraction of surviving particles (N₁/N₀) = 1/3\n*   Radius (R) = 30 m\n\nPlugging these values into our equation:\n\n1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * cτ_proper))\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ_proper)\n-ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ_proper)\nln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ_proper)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Fraction of surviving particles (N₂/N₀) = 2/3\n*   Radius (R) = 30 m\n*   The Lorentz factor (γ₂) is what we need to find.\n\nThe equation for this scenario is:\n\n2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ_proper))\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ_proper)\n-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ_proper)\nln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ_proper)\n\n**Solving for the new Lorentz factor (γ₂):**\n\nWe now have a system of two equations. A convenient way to solve for γ₂ is to take the ratio of the logarithmic equations.\n\nDivide the equation from Scenario 1 by the equation from Scenario 2:\n\n[ln(3)] / [ln(3/2)] = [1.5 / (cτ_proper)] / [30 / (γ₂ * cτ_proper)]\nln(3) / ln(3/2) = (1.5 / cτ_proper) * (γ₂ * cτ_proper / 30)\nln(3) / ln(3/2) = 1.5 * γ₂ / 30\nln(3) / ln(3/2) = γ₂ / 20\n\nNow, we can solve for γ₂:\n\nγ₂ = 20 * [ln(3) / ln(3/2)]\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms:\n*   ln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n*   ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055\n\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709\nγ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\nThis calculated value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"
