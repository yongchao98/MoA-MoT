    "The number of loops in a Feynman diagram is directly related to the power of the `1/(4π)` factor in the mathematical expression for the diagram's amplitude, particularly when using dimensional regularization.\n\nIn a four-dimensional spacetime, each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of `1/(4π)^2` to the overall expression. This arises from integrating over the unconstrained four-dimensional momentum within the loop.\n\nThe expression found on the note is:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nThe key term for determining the number of loops is `1/(4pi)^6`.\n\nIf we let `L` be the number of loops, the total factor from all loops will be `(1/(4pi)^2)^L`. We can set this equal to the term in the expression:\n\n`(1/(4pi)^2)^L = 1/(4pi)^6`\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n`1/(4pi)^(2L) = 1/(4pi)^6`\n\nBy comparing the exponents, we find:\n\n`2L = 6`\n`L = 3`\n\nThe other terms in the expression relate to different aspects of the calculation: `alpha^3` and `g^2` are related to the coupling constants at the vertices, and `(Q/M)^2` is a ratio of energy scales. However, the power of `4π` is the most direct indicator of the number of loops. Therefore, the Feynman diagram had 3 loops.\n\n<<<C>>>"
