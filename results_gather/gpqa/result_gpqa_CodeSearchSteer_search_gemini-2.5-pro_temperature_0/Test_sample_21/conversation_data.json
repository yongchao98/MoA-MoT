    "Based on the principles of electrochemistry, the correct statement can be completed by analyzing the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of oxygen.\n\n**1. Thermodynamics: Oxidizing Strength in Basic Solutions**\n\nThe strength of an oxidizing agent is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive E° indicates a stronger oxidant.\n\n*   In an **acidic solution**, the reduction of oxygen is represented by the half-reaction:\n    O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O, with a standard potential of **E° = +1.23 V**.\n*   In a **basic (alkaline) solution**, the half-reaction is:\n    O₂ + 2H₂O + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻, with a standard potential of **E° = +0.40 V**.\n\nSince the standard reduction potential in a basic solution (+0.40 V) is significantly lower than in an acidic solution (+1.23 V), oxygen has a weaker tendency to accept electrons in basic conditions. Therefore, thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n\n**2. Kinetics: Reaction Speed in Acidic Solutions**\n\nKinetics refers to the rate of a reaction. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is known for being kinetically sluggish. However, the reaction rate is not the same in all conditions.\n\n*   In **alkaline solutions**, the kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction are generally more favorable, or faster.\n*   In **acidic solutions**, the reaction is comparatively **slower**. This is a major challenge in the development of technologies like proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, which operate in acidic environments.\n\nTherefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe correct combination to complete the sentence is **weaker** and **slower**.\n\n*   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n*   Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
