    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n### 1. Calculate the initial moles of each substance\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles for each of the reactants before they are mixed.\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH₃COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol CH₃COOH**\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 mol HCl**\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing **0.080 mol of H⁺ ions**.\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂), a strong base:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = **0.090 mol Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, it completely dissociates to produce two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol OH⁻**\n\n### 2. Perform the neutralization reactions\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with all available acidic protons. The reaction with the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) occurs first, followed by the reaction with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n*   **Step 2a: Strong Acid-Strong Base Neutralization**\n    *   The 0.180 mol of OH⁻ reacts with the 0.080 mol of H⁺ from HCl.\n    *   OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = **0.100 mol OH⁻**\n    *   All the H⁺ from HCl is consumed.\n\n*   **Step 2b: Strong Base-Weak Acid Neutralization**\n    *   The remaining 0.100 mol of OH⁻ reacts with the 0.050 mol of CH₃COOH.\n    *   OH⁻ remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = **0.050 mol OH⁻**\n    *   All the CH₃COOH is consumed, forming 0.050 mol of its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n\n### 3. Determine the final composition and calculate the pH\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH⁻). The pH of the solution will be primarily determined by the concentration of this excess OH⁻.\n\n*   **Total Volume of the Solution:**\n    *   V_total = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\n*   **Concentration of Excess OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
