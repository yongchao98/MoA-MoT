    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the principles of electrostatics:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity of the uncharged spherical conductor will attract the free electrons within the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity, inducing a total charge of `-q` on this surface.\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** Since the conductor was initially neutral, the accumulation of `-q` on the inner surface leaves a net positive charge of `+q` on the conductor. In electrostatic equilibrium, this excess charge will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is that they provide electrostatic shielding. The charges on the inner surface of the cavity (`-q`) and the charge `+q` inside the cavity arrange themselves in such a way that their combined electric field is cancelled out within the conducting material itself. This means the charge distribution on the outer surface is not affected by the specific location (`s`, `r`, `l`, `θ`) of the charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n4.  **Field Outside the Conductor:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is produced solely by the charge distributed on the outer surface. Because the outer surface is a sphere of radius `R`, the induced charge `+q` will spread uniformly over this surface.\n5.  **Applying Gauss's Law (or Shell Theorem):** For a point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge equal to the total charge of the sphere, located at its center.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor. Therefore, the electric field at point P is the same as that of a point charge `+q` located at the conductor's center. The magnitude of this field is given by Coulomb's law:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe distances `l`, `s`, `r`, and the angle `θ` are irrelevant for calculating the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\n<<<A>>>"
