    "This is a classic chemical puzzle that can be solved by systematically identifying each unknown substance (A through H) based on the described reactions.\n\n1.  **Identifying Gases B and D, and Solvent H:** The reaction where gas D and gas B react in a 1:1 ratio to form solvent H is a strong starting point. A well-known reaction that fits this description is the formation of phosgene (COCl₂) from carbon monoxide (CO) and chlorine (Cl₂). Phosgene is a toxic gas but is used as a solvent in some industrial applications. Another possibility is the reaction of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and chlorine (Cl₂) to form sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂), which is also a solvent.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Acids F and G:** The hydrolysis of product C reforms solid A and produces a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G). This indicates that the ligands on C (which come from gas B) are responsible for forming the acids.\n    *   If B were CO, its hydrolysis would not produce acids.\n    *   If B were Cl₂, its hydrolysis (Cl₂ + H₂O ⇌ HCl + HOCl) produces hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is a strong acid, and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which is a weak acid. This perfectly matches the description.\n\n3.  **Confirming the Identities of A, B, C, D, and H:**\n    *   Based on the hydrolysis, **B** must be **chlorine gas (Cl₂) **, **F** is **hydrochloric acid (HCl)**, and **G** is **hypochlorous acid (HOCl)**.\n    *   Since B is Cl₂, and it reacts 1:1 with D to form a solvent, D is most likely **carbon monoxide (CO)**, making the solvent H **phosgene (COCl₂)**.\n    *   Now we must identify A and C. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B (Cl₂) to form the bright red product C. A known, though somewhat obscure, reaction fits this stoichiometry: solid iodine (I₂) reacts with excess chlorine.\n    *   Therefore, **A** is **Iodine (I₂) **.\n    *   The reaction is I₂(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 2[ICl₂]⁺[Cl₃]⁻. The product, a complex of iodine and chlorine, can be described as a bright red or orange-yellow solid. So, **C** is the **iodine-chlorine complex, 2[ICl₂]⁺[Cl₃]⁻**.\n    *   The hydrolysis of this complex (C) reforms iodine (A) and produces HCl (F) and HOCl (G), which is consistent with all observations.\n\n4.  **Identifying Product E and its Symmetry:**\n    *   Product C (the iodine-chlorine complex) reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D (CO) to produce the extremely hazardous product E.\n    *   The reaction is: 2[ICl₂]⁺[Cl₃]⁻ (C) + 2CO (D) → 2ICl₃ + 2COCl₂ (E).\n    *   The extremely hazardous product **E** is **phosgene (COCl₂)**. Phosgene is listed as an extremely hazardous substance.\n    *   The final step is to determine the molecular symmetry group of phosgene. The molecule has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. It is a planar molecule.\n    *   It possesses a C₂ rotation axis along the C=O bond.\n    *   It has two vertical mirror planes (one containing the molecule and one perpendicular to it).\n    *   A molecule with a C₂ axis and two vertical mirror planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (phosgene) is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<C>>>"
