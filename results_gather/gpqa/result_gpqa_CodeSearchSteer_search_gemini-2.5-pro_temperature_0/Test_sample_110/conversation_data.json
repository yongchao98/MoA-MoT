    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK) will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile. The ethyl acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Determine the site of enolate formation:** The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The carbon at position 2 (C2) is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has no α-protons.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 (C6) is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has one α-proton.\n    *   Since C6 is the only position with an α-proton, the bulky base t-BuOK will exclusively deprotonate this carbon to form the corresponding enolate.\n\n3.  **Predict the Michael addition product:** The enolate formed at C6 will attack the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) in a conjugate addition. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure and name of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting product has the cyclohexanone core with the original substituents (ethyl and methyl at C2, methyl at C6) and a new substituent at C6, which is an ethyl propanoate group attached via its C3.\n    *   Let's name this product. If we treat the ethyl propanoate as the parent chain, the cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3. The numbering of the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent starts at the point of attachment (C1).\n        *   The point of attachment (our original C6) is now C1 of the substituent name. It has a methyl group.\n        *   The carbonyl group (original C1) is adjacent, so it is at C2.\n        *   The quaternary carbon (original C2) is at position C3. It has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a nitro-Michael addition, a variation of the Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group, creating a nitronate anion which is a potent nucleophile (a Michael donor). (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the α,β-unsaturated Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Determine the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   **Nucleophile:** KOH deprotonates the C1 of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to form the nitronate anion, [CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)]⁻.\n    *   **Electrophile:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN). The nucleophilic attack will occur at the β-carbon (the carbon atom of the C=C double bond that is further from the -CN group).\n\n3.  **Predict the Michael addition product:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the original but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure and name of Product B:**\n    *   The structure of the product is CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN.\n    *   To name this compound, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon is six carbons long, so it is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1:\n        *   N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A** is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\n*   **Product B** is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
