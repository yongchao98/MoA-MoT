    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of large neutral hydrogen clouds that can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the wavelength of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) transition and the limitations imposed by Earth's atmosphere.\n\n1.  **Lyman-alpha Wavelength**: The Lyα spectral line, which is absorbed by neutral hydrogen, has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å) or 121.6 nanometers. This wavelength falls within the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Atmospheric Cutoff**: Earth's atmosphere blocks most UV radiation from reaching the ground. Ground-based optical telescopes can typically only detect light down to a wavelength of about 3200-3500 Å (320-350 nm) due to atmospheric absorption, primarily by ozone. For a spectral line to be detectable from the ground, it must be redshifted to a wavelength longer than this atmospheric cutoff.\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation**: The redshift (z) describes how much the light from a distant object has been stretched to longer wavelengths. The formula relating rest wavelength (λ_rest), observed wavelength (λ_observed), and redshift is:\n\n    *z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1*\n\n    To find the minimum redshift, we set λ_observed to the atmospheric cutoff limit (~3500 Å) and use the rest wavelength of Lyα (~1216 Å):\n\n    *z = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1*\n    *z ≈ 2.88 - 1*\n    *z ≈ 1.88*\n\nThis calculation shows that a redshift of approximately 1.9 is required to shift the 1216 Å Lyα line to about 3526 Å, moving it into the near-UV/optical window accessible by ground-based telescopes. While direct observations of neutral hydrogen via the Lyα transition at lower redshifts require space-based telescopes, ground-based observations become possible for objects with a redshift of z ≳ 1.7.\n\nBased on this calculation, the most plausible lower limit among the given options is 1.9.\n\n<<<A>>>"
