    "The defining characteristic of radioactive decay is that it is a \"memoryless\" process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. Therefore, the fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes has no bearing on its future decay probability.\n\nWe can solve this problem by first calculating the decay constant (λ) from the information provided and then using it to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.\n\n### 1. Understand the Formulas\n\nThe probability of an atom *not* decaying (surviving) within a time `t` is given by the formula:\nP(survival) = e^(-λt)\n\nWhere:\n*   `e` is the base of the natural logarithm.\n*   `λ` is the decay constant.\n*   `t` is the time.\n\nConsequently, the probability of an atom decaying within time `t` is:\nP(decay) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n### 2. Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n\n*   P(decay in 100 min) = 0.32\n*   1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n\nFrom this, we can determine the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\n\n*   e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32\n*   e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes\n\nDue to the memoryless nature of radioactive decay, the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant. We need to calculate the probability of the atom decaying in a 150-minute interval.\n\n*   P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nWe can find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)` by using the value we found in the previous step:\n\n*   e^(-λ * 150) = (e^(-λ * 100))^(150/100) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n*   e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nNow, we calculate the value:\n\n*   (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n\nFinally, we can calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes:\n\n*   P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.5607\n*   P(decay in 150 min) ≈ 0.4393\n\nThis probability, 0.4393, is equivalent to 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
