    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the velocity of particle A.\n\n### 1. Principle of Conservation of Energy\n\nThe process is the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) into four new particles ($2A^{+} + 2A^{-}$). According to the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n\n### 2. Initial Energy\n\n*   The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume it is at rest.\n*   In the center-of-mass frame of the proton-antiproton system, both particles can be considered to be at rest, so their total initial energy is the sum of their rest energies.\n*   The rest energy of a proton is equal to the rest energy of an antiproton. From the CODATA value, the rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.27 MeV.\n*   Total initial energy ($E_i$):\n    $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    $E_i = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### 3. Final Energy\n\n*   The annihilation produces four particles of type A (two positive, two negative), and they will be moving at high velocity.\n*   The mass of each particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   The total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic energy formula: $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n*   Since the initial momentum is zero, the four final particles must be produced in a way that conserves momentum (e.g., in back-to-back pairs). By symmetry, each of the four particles will have the same kinetic energy and thus the same total energy.\n*   Total final energy ($E_f$):\n    $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    $E_f = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### 4. Calculating the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)\n\nBy equating the initial and final energies ($E_i = E_f$):\n\n$1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\nNow, we solve for $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n### 5. Calculating the Velocity (v)\n\nThe Lorentz factor is related to velocity by the formula:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the velocity ($v$):\n\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.77c.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the calculated velocity with the given options:\nA) 0.96c\nB) 0.86c\nC) 0.91c\nD) 0.77c\n\nThe calculated velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77c, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
