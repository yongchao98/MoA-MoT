    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it absorbs from its star. The formula is:\n\nT_eq ∝ (1/a²)¹ᐟ⁴ = a⁻¹ᐟ²\n\nwhere 'a' is the semi-major axis of the orbit. For circular orbits, this is the orbital distance.\n\nFrom this relationship, we can establish a ratio between the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (Planet i and Planet j) orbiting the same star:\n\n(T_eq_i / T_eq_j) = (a_j / a_i)¹ᐟ²\n\nBy squaring both sides, we can find the ratio of their orbital distances:\n\n(a_j / a_i) = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)²\n\nThe problem states that the albedo is the same for all three planets, which validates using this simplified relationship. The information about the specific albedo value (0.3) is not needed for the calculation, only that it is constant.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Distances\n\nUsing the formula derived in Step 1 and the given temperature ratios:\n\n*   **For Planet 1 and Planet 2:**\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n    *   a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)² = 1.4² = 1.96\n\n*   **For Planet 2 and Planet 3:**\n    *   T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n    *   a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)² = 2.3² = 5.29\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1 by multiplying the individual ratios:\n\na3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ 10.3684\n\n### Step 3: Use Kepler's Third Law to Find the Orbital Period Ratio\n\nKepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a).\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nFor two planets orbiting the same star, the ratio of their periods is:\n\n(P_j / P_i)² = (a_j / a_i)³\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n\nP_j / P_i = (a_j / a_i)³ᐟ²\n\nThe information about the planets' masses is extraneous because a planet's mass is typically negligible compared to its host star's mass, and this is a standard assumption in such calculations unless specified otherwise.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer\n\nUsing the ratio of the orbital distances calculated in Step 2, we can now find the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet 3 and Planet 1:\n\nP3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)³ᐟ² = (10.3684)¹·⁵\n\nP3 / P1 ≈ 33.43\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
