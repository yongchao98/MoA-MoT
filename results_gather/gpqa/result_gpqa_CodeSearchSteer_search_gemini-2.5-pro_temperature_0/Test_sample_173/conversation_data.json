    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of rest mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum: `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies `T₁` and `T₂` and momenta `p₁` and `p₂`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest Masses of the Fragments\n\nThe problem states:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n2.  The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M`\n`m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nNow, find `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNext, convert these masses into their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m₁c² = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   `m₂c² = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, the initial energy equals the final total energy (rest-mass energy + kinetic energy).\n\n`Mc² = (m₁c² + T₁) + (m₂c² + T₂)`\n`Mc² = (m₁c² + m₂c²) + (T₁ + T₂)`\n\nThe total kinetic energy of the fragments, `Q = T₁ + T₂`, is the energy released in the fission:\n`Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p²/2m`.\nFrom the conservation of momentum, the initial momentum is zero, so the final momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n\nTherefore:\n`T₁_classical = p² / (2m₁)`\n`T₂_classical = p² / (2m₂)`\n\nWe can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`\n`T₁_classical / T₂_classical = 99 GeV / 198 GeV = 1/2`\nSo, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n`T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Formulas\n\nThe relativistic relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The total energy `E` is also `E = T + mc²`.\nSubstituting `E` into the equation gives:\n`(T + mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`T² + 2Tmc² + (mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, `|p₁| = |p₂|`, so `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n`T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n\nWe know `T₁ + T₂ = Q = 3 GeV`, so `T₂ = 3 - T₁`. Substitute this and the rest-mass energies into the equation:\n`T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = T₁² - 204T₁ + 603`\n`396T₁ = -204T₁ + 603`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n`T₁_correct = 1005 MeV`\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct `T₁` value and the classically calculated `T₁` value.\n\n`Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV`\n`Difference = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<C>>>"
