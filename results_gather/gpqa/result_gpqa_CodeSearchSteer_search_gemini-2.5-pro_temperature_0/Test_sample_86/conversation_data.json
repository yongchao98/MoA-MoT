    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n### 1. Deducing the Molecular Structure\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C₆H₄). This accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The molecule contains a total of 8 carbon atoms. This leaves 2 carbons for the two substituents.\n*   **Functional Groups:** The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. This means one substituent is a halogen (-X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I), and the other substituent must contain the carbonyl group and the remaining two carbons.\n*   **Substituents:** The halogen substituent has zero carbon atoms. Therefore, the second substituent must contain both carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable group fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Compound Identity:** The compound is a haloacetophenone (C₈H₇XO).\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Substitution Pattern and Expected NMR\n\nThe two substituents (halogen and acetyl group) can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4). The 1H NMR spectrum is highly dependent on this arrangement.\n\n*   **Acetyl Group Signal:** The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) in the acetyl substituent are equivalent and not coupled to any other protons. They will appear as a sharp **singlet (s)**, integrating to 3H, typically in the chemical shift range of 2-3 ppm.\n*   **Aromatic Proton Signals:**\n    *   **Para-substitution (1,4):** This arrangement is symmetrical. There are two sets of chemically equivalent protons on the ring. The two protons adjacent (ortho) to the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the halogen are equivalent. This symmetry results in a simple pattern of **two doublets (d)** in the aromatic region (typically 7.0-8.5 ppm), with each doublet integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Ortho-substitution (1,2):** This arrangement is unsymmetrical, and all four aromatic protons are chemically different. This would lead to a complex pattern of four signals, likely multiplets, in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Meta-substitution (1,3):** This arrangement is also unsymmetrical and would produce a more complex spectrum than the para isomer, likely with four distinct signals.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's compare the predicted spectra with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm, which is characteristic of an acetyl group's methyl protons.\n    *   It also shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2 protons. This pattern is the hallmark of a para-substituted (1,4) benzene ring.\n    *   This data perfectly matches the expected spectrum for a **p-haloacetophenone**. For instance, the 1H NMR spectrum for 4'-Chloroacetophenone shows a singlet at ~2.6 ppm and two doublets at ~7.45 ppm and ~7.91 ppm. Similarly, 4'-Bromoacetophenone shows a singlet at ~2.6 ppm and two doublets at ~7.6 ppm and ~7.8 ppm. The values in option A are consistent with these known compounds.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks the characteristic 3H singlet for an acetyl group and the typical aromatic signals. The chemical shifts are not in the expected range for this type of compound.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   While there is a 3H singlet, its chemical shift (1.3 ppm) is too low for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. The other signals are not in the aromatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. An aldehyde would not fit the 8-carbon total with the remaining signals. This option does not match the deduced structure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the compound is a para-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data presented in option A is the only one that correctly represents the signals for such a structure: a singlet for the acetyl methyl group and two doublets for the para-substituted aromatic protons.\n\n<<<A>>>"
