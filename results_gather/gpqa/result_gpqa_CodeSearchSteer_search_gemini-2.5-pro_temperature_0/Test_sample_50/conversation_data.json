    "To solve this problem, we use the method of images. The grounded conducting sphere can be replaced by an \"image\" charge, which, together with the original charge `q`, reproduces the correct potential (zero) on the surface of the sphere.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the sphere can be replaced by an image charge `q'` at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and `q`. The values for the image charge and its position are:\n    *   Image charge: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n2.  **Calculating Potential Energy**: The potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the attractive force between the real charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere. This force is equivalent to the force between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n    There are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n        The force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center is the force exerted by its image:\n        `F(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)^2`\n        The image charge at that point is `q'(x) = -qR/x` and its position is `b(x) = R^2/x`. The distance between them is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n        The work done is the integral of this force from infinity to `d`.\n        `U = W = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx`\n        Performing this integration yields:\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using Potential `U = (1/2)qV`**\n        A more direct method is to use the formula for the energy of a charge in the presence of a conductor. The potential energy is half the product of the charge and the potential at its location created by the induced charges. The potential created by the induced charges is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n        The potential at the location of `q` (distance `d`) due to the image charge `q'` is:\n        `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        `V_image = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n        The potential energy is then:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_image = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, which corresponds to option A. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charge distribution's own energy (self-energy) changes as the charge `q` is brought in from infinity.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
