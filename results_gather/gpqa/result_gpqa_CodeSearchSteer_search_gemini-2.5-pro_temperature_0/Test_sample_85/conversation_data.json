    "To determine the correct starting materials, A and B, we must analyze the two reactions, paying close attention to the reagents and the stereochemistry of the products.\n\nThe starting material in the options is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which has two carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-isobutyl). It also has a chiral center at the 3-position. The product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which forms from the cyclization of 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The stereochemistry of the chiral center at the 4-position of the lactone is specified in each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄)\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nLithium borohydride is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group at the C5 position to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 untouched. This forms 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid to form the lactone.\n\nThe reduction and lactonization steps do not affect the stereocenter at C3 of the starting material, which becomes the C4 stereocenter of the lactone product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\n*   **Starting Material A:** (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n### Reaction B\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃)\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nBorane is a reducing agent known for its ability to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. Therefore, BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group at the C1 position to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the isobutyl ester group at C5 intact. This forms isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate. The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification reaction. The hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the lactone.\n\nSimilar to the first reaction, the stereochemistry at the C3 position is retained throughout the reaction sequence. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\n*   **Starting Material B:** (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the selectivity of the reducing agents and the stereochemistry of the products:\n*   Starting material A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
