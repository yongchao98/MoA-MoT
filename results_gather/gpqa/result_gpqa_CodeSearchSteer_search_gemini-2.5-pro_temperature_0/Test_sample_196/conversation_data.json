    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n### **Step 1: Identify Compound X from the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n**A. Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid, which is broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid. The frequency is slightly lower than a typical saturated acid due to conjugation with the aromatic ring.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The IR data strongly indicates that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**B. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet, significantly downfield, is the classic chemical shift for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm), each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n*   **Alkyl Region Signals:**\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH₂ group.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH group.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is consistent with a -CH₂- group coupled to protons on both sides.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton in the benzylic position (shifted downfield) is consistent with a -CH group attached to the benzene ring and coupled to several other protons.\n\n**Assembling the Alkyl Group:** The fragments (-CH₃ next to -CH₂) and (-CH₃ next to -CH) can be assembled into a *sec*-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The methine proton (-CH) corresponds to the 2.9 ppm signal.\n    *   The adjacent methyl group (-CH₃) corresponds to the doublet at 1.4 ppm.\n    *   The methylene group (-CH₂-) corresponds to the multiplet at 1.7 ppm.\n    *   The terminal methyl group (-CH₃) corresponds to the triplet at 0.9 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion for Compound X:** Combining all the data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (A).\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Reaction Product**\n\nThe problem states that Compound X, identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, reacts with **red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their corresponding alkanes (-CH₃).\n\n*   **Applying the Reaction:** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a methyl group. The *sec*-butyl group and the aromatic ring will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n\n    **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid → 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**\n\n### **Step 3: Identify the Final Product from the Options**\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X).\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This is an isomer of the starting material, not the product.\n*   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This is the correct product from the reduction of the carboxylic acid group to a methyl group.\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has an incorrect alkyl group (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
