    "This problem involves the process of pair production, where two photons annihilate to create an electron-positron pair: $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. For this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame of the two photons must be at least the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair.\n\nHere are the steps to determine the threshold energy of the high-energy gamma-ray:\n\n1.  **Rest Energy of the Products**: The final products are an electron ($e^-$) and a positron ($e^+$). The rest mass of an electron is $m_e = 0.511 \\text{ MeV}/c^2$. Since a positron has the same mass, the total rest mass energy required to create the pair is $E_{rest} = 2m_e c^2$.\n    $E_{rest} = 2 \\times 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 1.022 \\text{ MeV} = 1.022 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n\n2.  **Center-of-Mass Energy**: We consider a high-energy gamma-ray with energy $E_\\gamma$ colliding with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon of energy $E_{CMB}$. The threshold energy for $E_\\gamma$ will be at its minimum for a head-on collision. The square of the center-of-mass energy ($s$) for a head-on collision between two photons is given by $s = 4 E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$.\n\n3.  **Threshold Condition**: The reaction is possible if the center-of-mass energy is at least the rest energy of the products.\n    $\\sqrt{s} \\ge 2m_e c^2$\n    Squaring both sides gives:\n    $s \\ge (2m_e c^2)^2$\n    Substituting the expression for $s$:\n    $4 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} \\ge (2m_e c^2)^2$\n\n4.  **Solving for the Gamma-Ray Energy**: We can now solve for the threshold energy $E_\\gamma$.\n    $E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{(2m_e c^2)^2}{4 E_{CMB}} = \\frac{4(m_e c^2)^2}{4 E_{CMB}} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n5.  **Calculation**: We are given the necessary values:\n    *   Rest energy of an electron: $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n    *   Average energy of a CMB photon: $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n\n    Plugging these into the formula:\n    $E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_\\gamma \\ge 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n    $E_\\gamma \\ge 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n6.  **Unit Conversion**: The options are given in Giga-electron-volts (GeV). Since $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$:\n    $E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}}$\n    $E_\\gamma \\ge 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis result, approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV, indicates the energy threshold above which high-energy gamma-rays have their lifetimes significantly limited by pair production with CMB photons. This value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
