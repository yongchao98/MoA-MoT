    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the region of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically observed between 1760-1690 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which is usually found in the 1680-1620 cm⁻¹ range.\n\nThe combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch at 1700 cm⁻¹ is strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of a C=C double bond in the molecule.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺. The presence of this fragment provides further strong evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 4. Calculation of Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe spectroscopic data indicate the presence of two key features that contribute to the degree of unsaturation:\n1.  A carbonyl group (C=O) from the carboxylic acid.\n2.  A carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\nThis means the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation. Let's calculate the DoU for each of the possible formulas:\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has the correct DoU, but only one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid group that requires two oxygens.\n*   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This DoU is too low.\n*   **C) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has the correct degree of unsaturation (2) and the necessary two oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **D) C6H12O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This DoU is too low, and it only has one oxygen atom.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll pieces of evidence converge on a single answer. The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This requires two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O and one for the C=C) and two oxygen atoms. Only the formula **C6H10O2** meets all these criteria.\n\n<<<C>>>"
