    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Normalize the Initial State**\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix:\n`|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]`\n\nFirst, we need to normalize this state vector. The squared norm is:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n\nThe normalized state vector `|ψ_norm⟩` is:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`\n\n**2. First Measurement: Operator P**\n\nThe operator for the observable P is:\n`P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\nWe need to find the probability of measuring the value 0 for P. According to the postulates of quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator. The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvalues of P:**\n    We solve the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n    `det([[ -λ, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, -λ]]) = -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ = λ(1 - λ²) = 0`\n    The eigenvalues are `λ = 0, 1, -1`.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for the eigenvalue λ = 0:**\n    We need to solve the equation `P|p₀⟩ = 0|p₀⟩`.\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z] = [0, 0, 0]`\n    This gives the equations:\n    1.  `y/√2 = 0  => y = 0`\n    2.  `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0 => x = -z`\n    If we choose `z = 1`, then `x = -1`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[-1, 0, 1]`.\n\n*   **Normalize the eigenvector `|p₀⟩`:**\n    The squared norm is `(-1)² + 0² + 1² = 2`.\n    The normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0 is `|p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]`.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring P = 0:**\n    `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n    `⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]] . [(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]]`\n    `= (1/√12) * ((-1)*(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1) = 2/√12 = 1/√3`\n    `Prob(P=0) = (1/√3)² = 1/3`\n\n**3. State Collapse**\n\nAfter measuring P and obtaining the value 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector `|p₀⟩`. The new state of the system, `|ψ'⟩`, is:\n`|ψ'⟩ = |p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]`\n\n**4. Second Measurement: Operator Q**\n\nNow, we measure the observable Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`. The operator for Q is:\n`Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\nWe need to find the probability of measuring the value -1 for Q.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for the eigenvalue λ = -1:**\n    Since Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: `1, 0, -1`. The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n    The eigenvector for the eigenvalue -1 is `|q₋₁⟩ = [0, 0, 1]`. This is already normalized.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring Q = -1:**\n    This probability is calculated using the collapsed state `|ψ'⟩`.\n    `Prob(Q=-1) = |⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|²`\n    `⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] . [(1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]]`\n    `= (1/√2) * (0*(-1) + 0*0 + 1*1) = 1/√2`\n    `Prob(Q=-1) = (1/√2)² = 1/2`\n\n**5. Total Probability**\n\nThe probability of a sequence of measurements is the product of the individual probabilities.\n`Prob(P=0 and then Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)`\n`= (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nThe probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q is 1/6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
