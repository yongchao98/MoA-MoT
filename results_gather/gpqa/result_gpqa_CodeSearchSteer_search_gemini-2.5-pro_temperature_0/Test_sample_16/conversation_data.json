    "To determine the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in the solution, we need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA) for this reaction is given as 5x10¹⁰.\n\nThe problem involves the dissociation of the complex, which is the reverse reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation (K_d), sometimes called the instability constant, is the inverse of the formation constant.\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5x10¹⁰) = 2x10⁻¹¹\n\nWe can set up an equilibrium table (ICE table) to find the concentration of the dissociated ions. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions at equilibrium.\n\n*   **Initial concentration:** The stoichiometric concentration of the [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ complex is 0.02 M. The initial concentrations of free Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ are assumed to be 0.\n*   **Change:** As the complex dissociates, its concentration decreases by 'x', while the concentrations of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ each increase by 'x'.\n*   **Equilibrium concentration:**\n    *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the dissociation constant, K_d:\nK_d = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n2x10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the dissociation constant (K_d) is very small. This means the complex is very stable and will only dissociate to a very small extent. Therefore, 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can simplify the equation by approximating (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n2x10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x:\nx² ≈ (2x10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² ≈ 4x10⁻¹³\nx = √(4x10⁻¹³)\nx = 2x10⁻⁶.⁵\nx ≈ 6.32x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is 'x', which is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M. Comparing this to the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
