    "The search results confirm the steps I've outlined.\n\n1.  **Normalization Condition**: The integral of the squared modulus of the wave function over all space must equal 1. This is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics. The squared modulus, |ψ(x)|², represents the probability density of finding the particle at a given point.\n2.  **Integral Calculation**: The search results confirm that the integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|.\n3.  **Value of ln(2)**: The natural logarithm of 2 is approximately 0.693.\n\nMy calculation was:\n*   Probability density |ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25.\n*   The normalization integral is ∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1.\n*   Solving the integral:\n    *   ∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx = a² * [ln(1+x)] from 1 to 3 = a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) = a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2).\n    *   ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = [0.25x] from 1 to 3 = 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.5.\n*   The equation becomes: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.\n*   Solving for 'a':\n    *   a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n    *   a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n    *   Using ln(2) ≈ 0.6931, a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7214\n    *   a = sqrt(0.7214) ≈ 0.8493\n\nThis result is extremely close to option C, which is 0.85. The logic and calculations are sound and confirmed by the search results.\n\nFinal check of the steps and reasoning.\n- The problem defines a wave function for a particle.\n- It gives the spatial domain where the particle is found.\n- The core principle to solve this is the normalization of the wave function, which states that the total probability of finding the particle in its allowed region must be 1.\n- The probability is calculated from the square of the absolute value of the wave function, |ψ|².\n- The calculation of |ψ|² = ψ*ψ is correct.\n- The setup of the definite integral from 1 to 3 is correct.\n- The evaluation of the integral is correct.\n- The final algebraic solution for 'a' is correct.\n- The numerical result matches one of the options closely.\n\nThe information about the 10,000 systems is to ground the problem in the statistical nature of quantum mechanics, as described by the Born rule, but does not enter the normalization calculation for a single system's wave function.\n\nThe answer is C.\n\nTo solve for the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition of the wave function. This fundamental principle of quantum mechanics states that the total probability of finding the particle in all possible locations must be equal to 1. The probability of finding the particle at a specific position is given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |ψ(x)|².\n\nThe given wave function is:\nψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nFirst, we find the complex conjugate, ψ*(x), by changing the sign of the imaginary part:\nψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n\nNext, we calculate the probability density function, |ψ(x)|²:\n|ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x)ψ(x) = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i ]\n|ψ(x)|² = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) )² - (0.5*i)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - 0.25*i²\nSince i² = -1:\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nThe problem states that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, we must integrate the probability density function from 1 to 3, and this integral must equal 1.\n\n∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\nSolving the first part:\na² * ∫[from 1 to 3] (1 / (1 + x)) dx = a² * [ln|1 + x|] from 1 to 3\n= a² * (ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1))\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2))\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n= a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)\n\nSolving the second part:\n∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = [0.25x] from 1 to 3\n= 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5\n\nNow, we substitute these results back into the normalization equation:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nNow, we solve for \"a\":\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the value ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\na² ≈ 0.7214\na ≈ sqrt(0.7214)\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<C>>>"
