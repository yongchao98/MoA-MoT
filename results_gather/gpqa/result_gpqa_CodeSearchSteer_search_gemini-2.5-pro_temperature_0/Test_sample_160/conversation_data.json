    "This scenario requires a comparison between the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other (λ1) and the mean free path of high-energy electrons colliding with those same gas molecules (λ2).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the physics involved:\n\n*   **Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules (λ1):** This is the average distance a gas molecule travels before it collides with another gas molecule. It is determined by the number density of the molecules (n) and their kinetic collision cross-section (σ_gas), which is related to the physical size of the molecules. The formula is:\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas)\n\n*   **Mean Free Path of Electrons (λ2):** This is the average distance an electron travels before it scatters off a gas molecule. It depends on the same number density (n) but on the electron-gas molecule scattering cross-section (σ_electron). The formula is:\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_electron)\n\nThe core of the problem lies in comparing the two cross-sections:\n\n*   **Gas-Gas Collision Cross-Section (σ_gas):** This represents the effective target area one molecule presents to another. It's related to the physical diameter of the molecule.\n*   **Electron-Gas Scattering Cross-Section (σ_electron):** This represents the effective target area a gas molecule presents to a tiny, point-like, high-energy electron. An atom or molecule is mostly empty space, consisting of a small nucleus and a diffuse electron cloud. A high-energy electron interacts with this electromagnetic field, and the probability of such a scattering event is much lower than a physical collision between two much larger molecules. Therefore, the scattering cross-section for an electron is significantly smaller than the kinetic cross-section for a molecule.\n\n**Conclusion from the Physics:**\n\nSince σ_electron is much smaller than σ_gas, λ2 will be much larger than λ1. We can see this by taking the ratio of the two equations:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_electron)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas)]\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gas) / σ_electron\n\nSince σ_gas is larger than σ_electron, the ratio (σ_gas / σ_electron) is greater than 1. Multiplying by √2 (approximately 1.414) means the overall ratio must be greater than 1.414.\n\nTherefore, we can definitively conclude that **λ2 > 1.414 * λ1**.\n\nReviewing the given options:\n*   A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This statement is true because if λ2 is greater than 1.414 * λ1, it is certainly greater than 1.22 * λ1.\n*   B) λ2 < λ1: This is false.\n*   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This is false, as λ2 must be greater than 1.414 * λ1.\n*   D) λ2 = λ1: This is false.\n\nThe only conclusion that is consistent with the physical principles is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
