    "To determine the mass dimension of κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we first need to analyze the mass dimensions of each component in the interaction Lagrangian  \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}\\). We will work in natural units where ħ = c = 1.\n\n### 1. Mass Dimensions of the Fields and Operators\n\n*   **Action and Lagrangian:** The action, \\(S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}\\), is dimensionless. Since the spacetime integral \\(d^4x\\) has a mass dimension of [M]⁻⁴, the Lagrangian density \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) must have a mass dimension of [M]⁴ to compensate.\n*   **Fermion Field \\( \\psi \\):** The kinetic term for a fermion field in the Lagrangian is \\(\\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi\\). For the entire Lagrangian to have a mass dimension of [M]⁴, the term \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi\\) must have this dimension. The derivative \\(\\partial_\\mu\\) has a mass dimension of [M]¹. This leads to the conclusion that the fermion field \\(\\psi\\) has a mass dimension of [M]^(3/2).\n*   **Electromagnetic Field Strength Tensor \\( F^{\\mu\\nu} \\):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is \\(-\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}\\). This term must also have a mass dimension of [M]⁴. Therefore, \\( [F^{\\mu\\nu}]^2 = [M]^4 \\), which means the field strength tensor \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\) has a mass dimension of [M]².\n*   **Sigma Tensor \\( \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} \\):** The tensor \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is defined as \\(\\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]\\). The gamma matrices, \\(\\gamma_\\mu\\), are dimensionless. Consequently, their commutator, \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\), is also dimensionless, having a mass dimension of [M]⁰.\n\n### 2. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant κ\n\nNow we can determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ by ensuring the interaction Lagrangian \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}\\) has a mass dimension of [M]⁴.\n\nThe dimension of the interaction term is the product of the dimensions of its components:\n\\[ [\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] [\\bar{\\psi}] [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] [\\psi] [F^{\\mu\\nu}] \\]\n\nSubstituting the known dimensions:\n\\[ [M]^4 = [\\kappa] \\cdot [M]^{3/2} \\cdot [M]^0 \\cdot [M]^{3/2} \\cdot [M]^2 \\]\n\\[ [M]^4 = [\\kappa] \\cdot [M]^3 \\cdot [M]^2 \\]\n\\[ [M]^4 = [\\kappa] \\cdot [M]^5 \\]\n\nSolving for the mass dimension of κ:\n\\[ [\\kappa] = \\frac{[M]^4}{[M]^5} = [M]^{-1} \\]\n\nSo, the mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\n### 3. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nA key criterion for determining if a quantum field theory is renormalizable is the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n\n*   If all coupling constants have a non-negative mass dimension (≥ 0), the theory is generally renormalizable (or super-renormalizable if > 0).\n*   If any coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nIn this case, the mass dimension of κ is -1, which is negative. A negative mass dimension implies that as we consider higher-order corrections in perturbation theory, the divergences become progressively worse, requiring an infinite number of counterterms to absorb them. This makes the theory lose its predictive power.\n\nTherefore, the theory described by this interaction Lagrangian is not renormalizable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
