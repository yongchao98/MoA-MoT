    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### **Analysis of Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents into two groups: ortho-, para-directing and meta-directing.\n\n*   **Ortho-, Para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the positions ortho and para to themselves.\n    *   1) **-CH3** (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) **-C2H5** (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but still ortho-, para-directing.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer for these substances will be very low.\n    *   4) **-NO2** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n\n### **Ordering the Substances**\n\n**1. Meta-directing groups (Lowest para-yield):**\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce the smallest amount of the para-isomer.\n*   **Nitrobenzene (4):** The -NO2 group is a very strong deactivating, meta-director. Bromination of nitrobenzene requires harsh conditions and yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer (m-bromonitrobenzene). The para-isomer yield is negligible, often less than 1%.\n*   **Ethyl benzoate (2) and Benzoic acid (6):** The -COOC2H5 and -COOH groups are also deactivating and meta-directing. While still producing very low amounts of the para-isomer, they are generally less deactivating than the nitro group. For bromination of benzoic acid, the distribution is approximately 75-80% meta, 20-25% ortho, and only a very small fraction (1-2%) para. The ester group (-COOC2H5) behaves similarly to the carboxylic acid group.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-yield among the meta-directors is: **4 (-NO2) < 2 (-COOC2H5) ≈ 6 (-COOH)**. The options provided distinguish between 2 and 6, and typically the ester group is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid, but both result in very low para yields. Based on typical data, the order is generally considered **4 < 2 < 6**.\n\n**2. Ortho-, Para-directing groups (Highest para-yield):**\n\nFor these groups, the formation of the para-isomer is favored, and the yield is influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-product.\n\n*   **Chlorobenzene (3):** The -Cl group is ortho-, para-directing. For bromination, the para-isomer is the major product due to the steric bulk and electronic effect of the chlorine atom. The typical distribution for bromination gives a high yield of the para-isomer, often around 87-90%.\n*   **Toluene (1):** The -CH3 group is less sterically hindering than -Cl or -C2H5. During bromination, it yields a significant amount of both ortho and para products. The para-isomer yield is typically around 33-40%.\n*   **Ethylbenzene (5):** The -C2H5 group is bulkier than the -CH3 group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a greater preference for para-substitution compared to toluene. The para-isomer yield for bromination of ethylbenzene is higher than for toluene, typically around 40-50%.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-yield among the ortho-, para-directors is: **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**.\n\n### **Final Combined Order**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** Lowest yield (<1%).\n2.  **Ethyl benzoate (2):** Very low yield (~1-2%).\n3.  **Benzoic acid (6):** Very low yield (~1-2%, slightly different from the ester).\n4.  **Toluene (1):** Moderate para yield (~33-40%).\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** Higher para yield than toluene due to sterics (~40-50%).\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** Highest para yield (~87-90%).\n\nThe complete sequence is **4 < 2 < 6 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4 (Incorrect - reverse order)\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3 (Incorrect)\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5 (Incorrect)\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3 (This order is very close to our derived order, with a slight swap of 2 and 6, which have very similar and low para yields).\n\nLet's re-examine the order of 2 and 6. Both -COOH and -COOC2H5 are strongly deactivating and meta-directing. Their para yields are minimal and very close. The provided options suggest a specific order. Let's assume the order in option D is the intended one.\n\nFinal Order based on analysis and matching with options: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
