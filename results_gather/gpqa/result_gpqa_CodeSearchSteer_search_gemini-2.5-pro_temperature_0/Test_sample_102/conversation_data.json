    "To determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is necessary. The target molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) at positions 1, 3, and 5, respectively. This means all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** This is a strong deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n**Evaluation of Synthetic Routes:**\n\nA high-yield synthesis of a polysubstituted benzene typically requires the directing effects of the substituents to reinforce each other, meaning they direct the incoming group to the same position. Let's analyze the proposed options:\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence is incorrect because it involves the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline, followed by diazotization and then deamination with H3PO2, which would regenerate benzene, making the initial steps pointless.\n*   **Option B:** This sequence begins with the bromination of benzene to form bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The subsequent nitration would yield primarily 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, establishing a 1,4-substitution pattern that cannot lead to the desired 1,3,5-substituted product.\n*   **Option C:** This sequence involves forming acetanilide, then brominating it to get the *para* product (4-bromoacetanilide). Further nitration would occur *ortho* to the activating acetamido group, leading to a 1,2,4-substitution pattern, which is incorrect. Additionally, the sequence incorrectly suggests diazotizing an amide without a prior hydrolysis step.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence begins with two logical steps to form a 1,3-disubstituted benzene:\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene reacts with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and AlCl3 to form acetophenone.\n    2.  **ii) Bromination:** The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, so bromination of acetophenone with Br2/FeBr3 yields 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **iii) Nitration:** The next step is the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. At this stage, the ring has a *meta*-directing acetyl group and an *ortho, para*-directing bromo group. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5, while the bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. This conflict of directing effects would likely lead to a mixture of products, making it not a high-yield pathway for the specific isomer. Furthermore, the subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical as they would modify the already-formed target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion on Options:**\nAll the provided options are flawed either by leading to the wrong isomer, containing chemically incorrect steps, or including nonsensical reaction sequences.\n\n**Optimal Synthetic Route (Theoretical):**\nThe most efficient synthesis for a 1,3,5-trisubstituted product where two substituents are *meta*-directors is to introduce them sequentially to take advantage of reinforcing directing effects.\n1.  **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone (The acetyl group directs *meta*).\n3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. In this step, both the acetyl and nitro groups are *meta*-directors, and both direct the incoming bromine to position 5. This reinforcement should lead to a high yield of the desired product.\n\nSince this optimal route is not an option, and all given options are flawed, we must identify the \"least incorrect\" or most plausible choice. Option D correctly assembles the 1,3-disubstituted intermediate (3-bromoacetophenone) in its first two steps. The third step (nitration) is the only one among all options that could conceivably place the final group at the C-5 position, despite the conflicting directing effects. The remaining steps in option D are clearly erroneous. Given the choices, the initial sequence of Option D is the most plausible starting point for the synthesis, assuming there are significant errors in the question's options.\n\nHowever, based on a strict evaluation, none of the options describe a valid, high-yield synthesis. If a choice must be made, Option D is the only one that correctly establishes the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups before introducing the final nitro group.\n\n<<<D>>>"
