    "Based on the analysis of the provided 1H NMR data and supporting information from the search results, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the evidence:\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This singlet with an integration of three protons is characteristic of the methyl group in an acetate functional group (-O-C(=O)-CH3). All four possible compounds contain this group.\n*   **Signals in the Alkene Region (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm):** These two signals represent the two protons on the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant of 16.0 Hz. For vinylic protons (protons on a double bond), a large coupling constant in the range of 11-18 Hz is indicative of a *trans* configuration. A *cis* configuration would show a smaller coupling constant, typically between 6-12 Hz. This large J value is the key piece of evidence for a *trans* isomer.\n*   **Propenyl vs. Butenyl Group:**\n    *   The signal at 1.6 ppm is a doublet integrating to three protons (a methyl group). This methyl group is coupled to a single proton, causing it to appear as a doublet.\n    *   The signal at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means the proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (the other vinylic proton, causing the doublet splitting) and to a group of three protons (the methyl group, causing the quartet splitting).\n    *   This splitting pattern (a methyl doublet and a vinylic dq) confirms the presence of a propenyl group (CH3-CH=CH-). A butenyl group would have an ethyl substituent, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern.\n\nTherefore, the data unequivocally points to a structure with an acetate group and a *trans*-configured propenyl group.\n\n<<<D>>>"
