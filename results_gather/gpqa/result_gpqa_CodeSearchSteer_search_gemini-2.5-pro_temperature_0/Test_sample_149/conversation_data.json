    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of the Starting Compound**\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the initial reactant with the molecular formula C8H9NO from its ¹H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated as 5. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees, leaving one degree of unsaturation, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region are indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons suggests a primary amine (-NH₂) group attached to the aromatic ring.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet corresponds to a methylene (-CH₂-) group. Its coupling to the aldehyde proton (a single proton) explains the doublet multiplicity.\n\nBased on this data, the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, undergoes a three-step reaction.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** These reagents are used for diazotization. The primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The aldehyde group remains unaffected. The intermediate is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n2.  **H₂O:** The addition of water to the diazonium salt, typically with gentle warming, results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This reaction forms **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This compound has both an aldehyde group and α-protons (on the -CH₂- group), which are the classic requirements for an aldol condensation reaction.\n    *   The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton to form an enolate.\n    *   This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option C).\n    *   However, the presence of **heat** strongly favors the subsequent dehydration (loss of a water molecule) of this aldol addition product. This elimination results in the formation of a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n### **Step 3: Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThe dehydration of the aldol addition product, 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal, leads to the formation of a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons. The resulting structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n*   **But-2-enal:** A four-carbon chain with an aldehyde at position 1 and a double bond starting at position 2.\n*   **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl):** A 4-hydroxyphenyl group is attached to carbon 2, and another is attached to carbon 4.\n\nThis structure matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
