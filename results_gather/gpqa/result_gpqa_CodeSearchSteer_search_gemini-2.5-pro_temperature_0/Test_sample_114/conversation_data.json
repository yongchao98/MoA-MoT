    "To determine the angle between the directions of the two photons, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum to the electron-positron annihilation.\n\n### 1. Initial State: Energy and Momentum\n\nFirst, we calculate the total energy and momentum of the electron-positron pair before the collision. The energy (E) and momentum (p) of a relativistic particle are given by:\n*   E = γmc²\n*   (pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (γ² - 1)(mc²)²\n\nwhere:\n*   γ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   m is the rest mass of the particle (for both electron and positron, m_e).\n*   c is the speed of light.\n\n**Electron (e⁻):**\n*   Moves from the left (positive x-direction).\n*   Lorentz factor, γ_e = 4.\n*   Energy, E_e = 4 * m_e * c².\n*   Momentum, p_e * c = sqrt(4² - 1) * m_e * c² = sqrt(15) * m_e * c².\n\n**Positron (e⁺):**\n*   Moves from the right (negative x-direction).\n*   Lorentz factor, γ_p = 2.\n*   Energy, E_p = 2 * m_e * c².\n*   Momentum, p_p * c = -sqrt(2² - 1) * m_e * c² = -sqrt(3) * m_e * c².\n\n**Total Initial Energy and Momentum:**\n*   **Total Energy (E_initial):** E_e + E_p = (4 + 2) * m_e * c² = 6 * m_e * c².\n*   **Total Momentum (p_initial):** p_e + p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c.\n\n### 2. Final State: Two Photons\n\nAfter annihilation, two photons are produced.\n*   The problem states they have the same energy, let's call it E_γ.\n*   One photon moves upper-right at an angle θ to the horizontal axis.\n*   The other moves lower-right at an angle -θ to the horizontal axis. (The angles must be equal and opposite to conserve momentum in the vertical direction).\n*   The energy and momentum of a photon are related by E_γ = p_γ * c.\n\n### 3. Applying Conservation Laws\n\nThe total energy and momentum must be conserved during the annihilation.\n\n**Conservation of Energy:**\n*   E_initial = E_final\n*   6 * m_e * c² = E_γ + E_γ = 2 * E_γ\n*   Therefore, the energy of each photon is E_γ = 3 * m_e * c².\n\n**Conservation of Momentum:**\n*   The initial momentum is entirely in the x-direction.\n*   The final momentum is the sum of the momenta of the two photons.\n    *   Momentum of each photon, p_γ = E_γ / c = 3 * m_e * c.\n    *   The x-component of momentum for the first photon is p_γ * cos(θ).\n    *   The x-component for the second photon is p_γ * cos(-θ) = p_γ * cos(θ).\n    *   The total final momentum in the x-direction is p_final = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ).\n*   Equating initial and final momentum in the x-direction:\n    *   (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ)\n    *   (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 6 * cos(θ)\n\n### 4. Calculating the Angle\n\nNow, we solve for the angle θ:\n*   cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\n*   Using the approximate values sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873 and sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732:\n*   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n*   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\nThe question asks for the angle **between** the directions of the two photons, which is 2θ.\n*   Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°\n\nThis value is very close to 138.\n\n<<<B>>>"
