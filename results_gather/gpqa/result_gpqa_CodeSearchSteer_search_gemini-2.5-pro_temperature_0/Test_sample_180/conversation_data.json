    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the approximate ratio of the neutrino fluxes.\n\n### 1. Identify Neutrino Sources in Each Energy Band\n\nFirst, we must identify which solar fusion reactions produce neutrinos in the specified energy bands.\n\n*   **pp-III Branch:** This branch produces Boron-8 (`⁸B`). The subsequent decay of `⁸B` releases a neutrino with a continuous energy spectrum that extends up to about 15 MeV. This is the only neutrino source from the pp-III branch.\n*   **pp-II Branch:** This branch involves the electron capture by Beryllium-7 (`⁷Be`). This reaction produces neutrinos at two distinct energies (lines), with the vast majority at 861 keV (0.861 MeV) and a smaller number at 384 keV.\n*   **CNO Cycle:** This is a separate fusion process that produces neutrinos from the decay of Nitrogen-13 (`¹³N`) and Oxygen-15 (`¹⁵O`), among others. These have continuous energy spectra.\n\nNow let's look at the specific energy bands:\n*   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):** Under normal conditions, the neutrino flux in this band comes from the continuous spectra of `⁸B` and CNO neutrinos.\n*   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):** This band receives flux from the continuous spectra of `⁸B` and CNO neutrinos, but it is dominated by the very intense neutrino line from `⁷Be` decay at 861 keV.\n\n### 2. Apply the Hypothetical Scenario\n\nThe problem states that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped.\n\n*   **Effect:** The cessation of the pp-III branch means that the production of `⁸B` stops, and therefore the flux of `⁸B` neutrinos goes to zero.\n*   **Constraint:** The problem explicitly states that \"all other reactions remained as they were.\" This means the fluxes from the pp-II branch (`⁷Be` neutrinos) and the CNO cycle remain unchanged.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Fluxes in the New Scenario\n\nWith the `⁸B` neutrinos gone, the fluxes in the two bands are now:\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** The only remaining source of flux is the continuous spectrum from the CNO cycle neutrinos.\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** The flux now consists of the `⁷Be` line at 861 keV and the continuous spectrum from CNO neutrinos.\n\n### 4. Determine the Ratio\n\nThe question asks for the ratio: Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2).\n\nBased on our analysis, this ratio is:\n\n```\nRatio = (Flux from CNO in 700-800 keV) / (Flux from ⁷Be at 861 keV + Flux from CNO in 800-900 keV)\n```\n\nThe crucial point is the relative magnitude of these fluxes. The flux from the `⁷Be` line is immense, on the order of 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos per cm² per second. In contrast, the total flux from the entire CNO cycle is more than ten times smaller, on the order of 7 x 10⁸ neutrinos per cm² per second, and this flux is spread out over a wide energy range.\n\nThe flux from CNO neutrinos within a narrow 100 keV band is therefore a very small fraction of its total, and it is completely negligible compared to the massive flux from the `⁷Be` line.\n\nThis leads to a calculated ratio of a very small number divided by a very large number, which would be extremely close to zero (e.g., on the order of 10⁻⁸ or smaller). This does not match any of the provided options.\n\n### 5. Re-evaluating the Question's Intent\n\nGiven the discrepancy, it is highly probable that the question is implicitly asking for the ratio of the **continuous fluxes** only, treating the `⁷Be` line source as a special case to be excluded from the comparison of the underlying background. This is a common approach in spectral analysis.\n\nUnder this interpretation:\n\n*   **Continuous Flux in Band 1:** Sourced only by CNO neutrinos.\n*   **Continuous Flux in Band 2:** Sourced only by CNO neutrinos.\n\nThe CNO neutrino spectrum is a smooth and slowly decreasing function of energy in this region. Therefore, the flux in two adjacent narrow bands like 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV will be very similar. The flux in the lower energy band will be slightly higher than the flux in the higher energy band, meaning their ratio will be slightly greater than 1.\n\nGiven the options, the value \"1\" is the best approximation for this ratio.\n\n<<<C>>>"
