    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the 1H NMR data provided.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This means there are two types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and they are present in equal amounts. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that each compound contributes an equal number of protons to these two signals.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This indicates three distinct types of methyl groups in the mixture.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR spectra for each individual compound.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Low.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. They are meta to each other, so coupling is negligible, resulting in **two singlets** (1H each).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3, the one at C2, and the one at C5. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Moderate.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Because they are adjacent (ortho), they couple, but due to symmetry (an AA' system), they often appear as a single, sometimes broadened, signal. We will approximate this as **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or 1:1.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are equivalent, producing **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Each gives a quartet (-CH2-) and a triplet (-CH3). This results in **one quartet** (4H) and **one triplet** (6H), not singlets.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the options based on a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Would show three singlets (one 2H signal from the first compound and two 1H signals from the second), with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Would show four singlets (one from the first compound, three from the second). This does not match the observed three singlets.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Would show three singlets (two 1H signals from the first compound, one 4H signal from the second). This does not match.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Would show three singlets, a quartet, and a triplet. This does not match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Would show three singlets (one 2H signal from the first compound, two 1H signals from the second). This does not match.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Would show up to five singlets (two from the first, three from the second). This does not match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** The first compound gives one 2H singlet. The second compound gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 2H, giving the observed **1:1 ratio**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** The first compound gives one singlet (12H). The second compound gives two singlets (6H each). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene in a 1:1 mixture is the only option that perfectly explains the observed 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
