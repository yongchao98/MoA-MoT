    "To find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we first need to express the given potential in Cartesian coordinates. This often simplifies the Schrödinger equation, especially if the potential becomes separable.\n\n**1. Coordinate Transformation**\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nThe relationships between Cartesian coordinates (x, y) and polar coordinates are:\n*   x = r cos(θ)\n*   y = r sin(θ)\n*   r² = x² + y²\n\nSubstituting these into the potential energy function:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k(r cos(θ))²\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 kx²\n\nCombining the terms with x²:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 kx² + 3/2 kx²) + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = (4/2 kx²) + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\n**2. The Schrödinger Equation and Separation of Variables**\n\nThe potential is now in the form V(x, y) = V(x) + V(y), which represents a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system is:\n\n(-ħ²/2m)(∂²/∂x² + ∂²/∂y²)ψ(x, y) + (2kx² + 1/2 ky²)ψ(x, y) = Eψ(x, y)\n\nBecause the potential is separable, the total energy E is the sum of the energies from the independent motions in the x and y directions (E = Eₓ + Eᵧ), and the wave function is a product of one-dimensional wave functions (ψ(x, y) = ψₓ(x)ψᵧ(y)). This allows us to split the 2D equation into two separate 1D Schrödinger equations.\n\n**3. Energy Eigenvalues for Each Dimension**\n\nThe energy for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form V(z) = 1/2 k_eff z² is given by Eₙ = (n + 1/2)ħω, where the angular frequency ω = √(k_eff/m).\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    The potential is V(x) = 2kx² = 1/2 (4k)x².\n    The effective spring constant is kₓ = 4k.\n    The angular frequency is ωₓ = √(4k/m) = 2√(k/m).\n    The energy eigenvalues are Eₙₓ = (nₓ + 1/2)ħωₓ = (nₓ + 1/2)ħ(2√(k/m)).\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    The potential is V(y) = 1/2 ky².\n    The effective spring constant is kᵧ = k.\n    The angular frequency is ωᵧ = √(k/m).\n    The energy eigenvalues are Eₙᵧ = (nᵧ + 1/2)ħωᵧ = (nᵧ + 1/2)ħ√(k/m).\n\n**4. Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of the energies for the x and y oscillators.\nE = Eₙₓ + Eₙᵧ\nE = (nₓ + 1/2)ħ(2√(k/m)) + (nᵧ + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\n\nNow, we factor out the common term ħ√(k/m):\nE = [2(nₓ + 1/2) + (nᵧ + 1/2)] ħ√(k/m)\nE = [2nₓ + 1 + nᵧ + 1/2] ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + nᵧ + 3/2) ħ√(k/m)\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
