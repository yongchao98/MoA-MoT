    "The reaction of saturated epoxides with organocuprates, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a well-established method in organic synthesis for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The reaction follows a set of predictable rules for regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, which can be used to determine the structure of the product.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexene oxide. The bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane core indicates a cyclohexane ring fused to a three-membered ring, and the \"7-oxa\" designation confirms this is an epoxide. The stereochemistry (1R,3R,4R,6S) defines the specific three-dimensional arrangement of the substituents. Based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules, the epoxide oxygen and the methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4 are all on the same face of the cyclohexane ring (beta, or 'up').\n\n2.  **Reagent:** The reagent is Me2CuLi, lithium dimethylcuprate. In this reagent, the methyl group (Me) acts as a soft nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Regioselectivity:** The first rule provided states that the alkyl group of the organocuprate is introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to the other ring carbons.\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon, bonded only to hydrogen and the other ring carbons.\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon, and the nucleophilic methyl group will attack this position.\n\n4.  **Stereoselectivity:** The second rule states that inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is characteristic of an S_N2-type reaction mechanism. The nucleophile attacks the carbon from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond of the epoxide (anti-attack).\n    *   In the starting material, the epoxide ring is on the beta face ('up').\n    *   The methyl nucleophile must therefore attack C6 from the alpha face ('down').\n    *   This attack breaks the C6-O bond and causes an inversion of the stereocenter at C6. The hydrogen originally at C6 (alpha) is pushed to the beta position, and the new methyl group takes the alpha position.\n    *   The C1-O bond also breaks (as part of the ring opening), and the oxygen atom is protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The stereocenter at C1 is not attacked and retains its original configuration. The resulting -OH group will be on the beta face.\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are also unaffected by the reaction and retain their configurations.\n\n### Determining the Product Structure and Name\n\nFollowing the reaction, a new product is formed:\n*   The cyclohexane ring remains.\n*   An alcohol (-OH) is formed at C1, with beta stereochemistry.\n*   A new methyl group is added at C6, with alpha stereochemistry.\n*   The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 retain their positions and stereochemistry.\n\nTo name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1. Numbering proceeds around the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants, which results in a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\nThe final step is to assign the absolute configuration (R/S) to each chiral center in the product:\n*   **C1:** Retains its original R configuration.\n*   **C2 (originally C6):** The starting configuration was S. The SN2 attack causes a geometric inversion. However, due to changes in substituent priorities under the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules, the final designation for this center is S. This is a known phenomenon where geometric inversion does not lead to an R/S descriptor change.\n*   **C4 (originally C4):** Retains its original R configuration.\n*   **C5 (originally C3):** Retains its original R configuration.\n\nTherefore, the final product is (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<A>>>"
