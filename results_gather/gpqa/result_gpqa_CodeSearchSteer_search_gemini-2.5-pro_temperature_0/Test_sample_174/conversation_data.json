    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a clear axis of symmetry like a spheroid oscillating along its symmetry axis, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, provided its size is much smaller than the radiated wavelength λ. The behavior of such a dipole's radiation provides the answer.\n\n### Angular Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) by an oscillating electric dipole is not uniform in all directions. It follows a specific pattern dependent on the angle θ relative to the oscillation axis (the z-axis in this case). The formula is:\n\n*dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)*\n\nThe maximum power, A, is radiated where sin²(θ) is at its maximum. The maximum value of sin²(θ) is 1, which occurs at θ = 90° (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of 30°, we calculate sin²(30°):\n\n*   sin(30°) = 1/2\n*   sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4\n\nTherefore, the power radiated at 30° is 1/4 of the maximum power A.\n\n### Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe function *f* representing the radiated power per unit solid angle also depends on the wavelength λ. The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency ω.\n\n*dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴*\n\nSince the angular frequency ω is related to the wavelength λ by the equation ω = 2πc/λ (where c is the speed of light), we can determine the dependence on λ:\n\n*dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴*\n\nThis relationship is a cornerstone of radiation physics, famously explaining phenomena like Rayleigh scattering, which is why the sky appears blue.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these two findings:\n1.  The fraction of maximum power A radiated at θ = 30° is **1/4**.\n2.  A possible form of the function *f* shows a wavelength dependence of **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nIt is worth noting that if the spheroid were an oscillating electric quadrupole source, the angular dependence would be proportional to sin²(θ)cos²(θ) and the wavelength dependence would be λ⁻⁶. However, the simplest and most common model for such a charge distribution is the electric dipole.\n\n<<<C>>>"
