    "The calculation for the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction (S_y) for a given spin state involves three main steps: normalizing the state vector, defining the spin operator, and then calculating the expectation value.\n\n### 1. Normalize the Spin State\n\nThe given unnormalized spin state is |ψ⟩, represented by the vector (3i, 4).\n\n|ψ⟩ =\n  ( 3i )\n  ( 4  )\n\nFirst, we find the squared norm of this state, which is the inner product ⟨ψ|ψ⟩. The corresponding \"bra\" vector ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose of the \"ket\" |ψ⟩:\n\n⟨ψ| = (-3i, 4)\n\nThe inner product is:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25\n\nFor the state to be normalized, its norm must be 1. We find the normalization constant by taking the square root of the inner product, which is √25 = 5. We then divide the original state vector by this constant.\n\nThe normalized state |ψ_norm⟩ is:\n\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/5) *\n  ( 3i )\n  ( 4  )\n\n### 2. Define the S_y Operator\n\nThe spin operator for the y-direction, S_y, is defined in terms of the corresponding Pauli matrix σ_y and the reduced Planck constant ħ:\n\nS_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y\n\nGiven the matrix for σ_y:\n\nσ_y =\n  ( 0  -i )\n  ( i   0 )\n\nThe S_y operator is:\n\nS_y = (ħ/2) *\n  ( 0  -i )\n  ( i   0 )\n\n### 3. Calculate the Expectation Value ⟨S_y⟩\n\nThe expectation value of S_y for the normalized state is calculated as ⟨ψ_norm| S_y |ψ_norm⟩.\n\nFirst, let's apply the S_y operator to the normalized state |ψ_norm⟩:\n\nS_y |ψ_norm⟩ = [ (ħ/2) *\n  ( 0  -i )\n  ( i   0 ) ] * [ (1/5) *\n  ( 3i )\n  ( 4  ) ]\n\nS_y |ψ_norm⟩ = (ħ/10) *\n  ( 0*3i + (-i)*4 )\n  ( i*3i + 0*4   )\n\nS_y |ψ_norm⟩ = (ħ/10) *\n  ( -4i )\n  ( 3i² )\n\nS_y |ψ_norm⟩ = (ħ/10) *\n  ( -4i )\n  ( -3  )\n\nNow, we compute the inner product of ⟨ψ_norm| with the resulting vector:\n\n⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ_norm| (S_y |ψ_norm⟩)\n\n⟨S_y⟩ = [ (1/5) * (-3i, 4) ] * [ (ħ/10) *\n  ( -4i )\n  ( -3  ) ]\n\n⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * [ (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) ]\n⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * [ 12i² - 12 ]\n⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * [ -12 - 12 ]\n⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * [ -24 ]\n⟨S_y⟩ = -24ħ / 50\n⟨S_y⟩ = -12ħ / 25\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
