    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance.** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its star. It is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's distance (a) from the star. This can be expressed as:\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1/√a\n\n2.  **Formulate the temperature ratio.** Based on the relationship above, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = √(a_2 / a_4)\n    The problem states that the planets have the same albedo, which is the fraction of light reflected. Since the albedo is the same for both planets, it cancels out when calculating the ratio of their temperatures.\n\n3.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law.** Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a), which is the average distance from the star. For a system of planets orbiting the same star, this relationship can be written as:\n    *   P² ∝ a³\n    *   This can be rearranged to show the relationship between the semi-major axis and the period: a ∝ P^(2/3).\n\n4.  **Determine the ratio of the semi-major axes.** Using the relationship from Kepler's Third Law, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes of Planet_2 and Planet_4 in terms of their orbital periods:\n    *   a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)\n\n5.  **Substitute the semi-major axis ratio into the temperature ratio equation.**\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = √[(P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)]\n    *   This simplifies to: T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n6.  **Use the given orbital period ratios.** The problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the five planets as 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5. From this, we can determine the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    *   P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n7.  **Calculate the final temperature ratio.** Now, substitute the period ratio into the equation from step 5:\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<A>>>"
