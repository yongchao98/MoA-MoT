    "The impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations is a foundational concept that simplifies complex interactions by treating nucleons within a nucleus as if they were free particles at the moment of interaction. This approximation is defined by a set of core assumptions about the nature of the interaction and the nuclear environment.\n\nThe key assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is often called the \"one-body current\" assumption. It posits that the incoming probe (e.g., an electron or neutrino) interacts with a single nucleon at a time. This excludes more complex scenarios like meson-exchange currents, where the probe interacts with the force-carrying particles between nucleons, or any other process that involves two or more nucleons simultaneously (two-body currents).\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This assumption, known as the transparency or dilution assumption, means that the incoming probe and the struck nucleon do not interact with the other (A-1) nucleons in the nucleus on their way in or out. This neglects the effects of final-state interactions (FSI), where the outgoing particle scatters off the remaining nuclear constituents. This is a key component of the simplest form of the impulse approximation, often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA).\n\n3.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the central idea of the \"impulse\" itself. The assumption is that the interaction occurs over such a short timescale that the binding forces holding the nucleon within the nucleus are negligible during the collision. The nucleon is treated as a free particle, unbound from the nuclear potential at the instant of the interaction.\n\nThe third option provided in the question, regarding the non-relativistic nature of quarks, pertains to the internal structure of the nucleon itself. This is a separate layer of approximation used in nucleon models and is not a defining feature of the impulse approximation, which treats the nucleon as a whole entity within the nucleus.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
