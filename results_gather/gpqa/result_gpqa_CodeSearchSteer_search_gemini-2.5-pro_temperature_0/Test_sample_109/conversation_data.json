    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must consider two main criteria: the star's visibility from each observatory's location and its brightness.\n\n### Observability Criteria\n\n1.  **Location and Visibility**:\n    *   The HIRES spectrograph is at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, located in the Northern Hemisphere (latitude ~19.8° N).\n    *   The ESPRESSO spectrograph is at the Paranal Observatory in Chile, located in the Southern Hemisphere (latitude ~24.6° S).\n    *   The problem states to disregard pointing limits like minimum elevation. This implies that a star is observable as long as it theoretically rises above the horizon.\n    *   For Keck (latitude L ≈ +20°), stars with a declination (DEC) greater than L - 90° (or > -70°) are visible.\n    *   For Paranal (latitude L ≈ -25°), stars with a declination less than L + 90° (or < +65°) are visible.\n    *   Therefore, for a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must be between approximately **-70° and +65°**.\n\n2.  **Brightness (Apparent V Magnitude)**:\n    *   ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent magnitude (m) brighter than 17 (m < 17).\n    *   HIRES can observe stars with an apparent magnitude brighter than 16 (m < 16).\n    *   To be detected by **both**, a star must satisfy the stricter condition, meaning its apparent V magnitude must be **less than 16**.\n\n### Apparent Magnitude Calculation\n\nThe apparent magnitude (m) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) in parsecs using the distance modulus formula. If there is interstellar extinction (A_V), it must also be included.\nThe formula is: **m = M + 5 * log₁₀(d / 10) + A_V**\n\n### Analysis of Each Star\n\n*   **Star 1**:\n    *   **Visibility**: DEC = -75°. This is too far south to be seen from Keck Observatory.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 2**:\n    *   **Visibility**: DEC = +55°. This is within the visible range for both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness**: The given apparent magnitude is m = 16.5. This is not brighter than the HIRES limit of 16.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 3**:\n    *   **Visibility**: DEC = +48°. This is within the visible range for both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness**: The given apparent magnitude is m = 15.5. This is brighter than the required m < 16 limit.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star 4**:\n    *   **Visibility**: DEC = -48°. This is within the visible range for both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness**: We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   M = 15.5 mag\n        *   d = 10 pc\n        *   A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n        *   m = 15.5 + 5 * log₁₀(10 / 10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n    *   This apparent magnitude of 16.74 is not brighter than the HIRES limit of 16.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 5**:\n    *   **Visibility**: DEC = +60°. This is within the visible range for both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness**: We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   M = 16.5 mag\n        *   d = 5 pc\n        *   A_V = 0\n        *   m = 16.5 + 5 * log₁₀(5 / 10) = 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301) ≈ 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag.\n    *   This apparent magnitude of ~15.0 is brighter than the required m < 16 limit.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Observable by both.**\n\nBased on this analysis, only Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for detection by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n<<<A>>>"
