    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the correct option.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nTo find the relative speed of the two astronauts moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds, we must use the Einstein velocity subtraction formula. Let v1 be the speed of the faster astronaut (0.6c) and v2 be the speed of the slower astronaut (0.5c).\n\nThe formula for relative velocity is:\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c²)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n*   v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\n*   v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\n*   v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\n*   v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\n*   v_rel ≈ 0.142857c\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is 1 / √(1 - v²/c²). The total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the two astronauts.\n\n**Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass (m1) = 2m\n*   Velocity (v1) = 0.6c\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ1):\n    *   γ1 = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   Now, calculate the energy (E1):\n    *   E1 = γ1 * m1 * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²\n\n**Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass (m2) = 3m\n*   Velocity (v2) = 0.5c\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ2):\n    *   γ2 = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √(0.75) ≈ 1.1547\n*   Now, calculate the energy (E2):\n    *   E2 = γ2 * m2 * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.4641 mc²\n\n**Total System Energy:**\n*   E_total = E1 + E2\n*   E_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc²\n*   E_total = 5.9641 mc²\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy of the system is approximately 5.96 mc². This matches the values in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
