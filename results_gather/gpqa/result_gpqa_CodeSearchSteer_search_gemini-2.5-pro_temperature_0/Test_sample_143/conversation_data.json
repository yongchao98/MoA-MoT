    "To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the particle's lifetime (τ)**: The lifetime is inversely proportional to the decay width (Γ). The relationship is given by τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n2.  **Calculate the particle's velocity (v) and Lorentz factor (γ)**: These are determined from the particle's total energy (E_X) and mass (m_X).\n3.  **Calculate the mean decay distance (d)**: In the laboratory frame, the lifetime of the particle is dilated by the Lorentz factor. The mean decay distance is the distance the particle travels during this dilated lifetime, given by the formula d = v * γ * τ.\n\n**Given values:**\n*   Total energy (E_X) = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n*   Mass (m_X) = 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV\n*   Decay width (Γ_X) = 320 MeV\n\n**Step-by-step calculation:**\n\n1.  **Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the total energy to the rest mass energy.\n    γ = E_X / m_X = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV = 20 / 3\n\n2.  **Velocity (v):**\n    The velocity is related to the Lorentz factor by γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²). We can express the velocity in terms of the speed of light, c, using the factor β = v/c.\n    β = √(1 - 1/γ²) = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400) = √391 / 20\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Distance (d):**\n    The formula for the mean decay distance in the lab frame is d = γ * β * c * τ.\n    Substituting τ = ħ / Γ, we get d = γ * β * c * (ħ / Γ) = γ * β * (ħc / Γ).\n    The value of ħc (reduced Planck constant times the speed of light) is approximately 197.327 MeV fm.\n\n    Now, we can plug in the values:\n    d = (20/3) * (√391 / 20) * (197.327 MeV fm / 320 MeV)\n    d = (√391 / 3) * (197.327 / 320) fm\n    d ≈ (19.7737 / 3) * 0.6166 fm\n    d ≈ 6.5912 * 0.6166 fm\n    d ≈ 4.0655 fm\n\n    Since 1 femtometer (fm) is equal to 10⁻¹⁵ meters, the mean decay distance is:\n    d ≈ 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
