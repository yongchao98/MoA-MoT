    "A dominant-negative mutation occurs when a mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein produced from the other, normal allele. This is particularly common for proteins that must assemble into complexes, like dimers, to be functional.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the scenario:\n*   **Normal Function:** The transcription factor subunit must form a dimer to enter the nucleus and activate genes.\n*   **Mutation Y:** This mutation is in the dimerization domain. In a heterozygous individual, both normal and Y-mutant protein subunits are produced.\n*   **Dominant-Negative Mechanism:** The Y-mutant protein is still able to dimerize with the wild-type protein. However, the resulting wild-type/mutant heterodimer is non-functional. This formation of \"poisoned\" or non-productive dimers effectively sequesters the wild-type protein, preventing it from forming functional wild-type/wild-type dimers. This leads to an overall loss of the protein's function.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n*   **A) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is incorrect. Dimerization does occur (between wild-type and mutant proteins), and the result is a loss-of-function phenotype, not a wild-type one.\n*   **B) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** While some mutations can lead to protein degradation, the primary mechanism for a dominant-negative effect in a dimeric protein is interference through the formation of a non-functional complex, not the destruction of the wild-type protein.\n*   **C) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** This is the most accurate description. The formation of non-functional dimers is a form of protein-protein interaction that renders the complex inactive. A dimer is the simplest form of a protein aggregate. This \"aggregation\" into non-productive units directly causes the observed loss-of-function phenotype.\n*   **D) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** This is incorrect. A dominant-negative effect is a type of loss-of-function, not a gain-of-function where the protein would acquire a new or enhanced activity.\n\nTherefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is the formation of non-functional protein complexes (a form of aggregation) which leads to a loss-of-function phenotype.\n\n<<<C>>>"
