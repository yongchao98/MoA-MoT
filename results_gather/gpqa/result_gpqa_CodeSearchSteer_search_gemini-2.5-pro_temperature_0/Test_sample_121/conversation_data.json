    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Synthesis**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride:** This is an α-bromination reaction of acetic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. The product is bromoacetic acid.\n    *   **Product 1:** BrCH₂COOH\n\n2.  **Product 1 with ethanol and sulfuric acid:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol) in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n3.  **Product 2 with sodium cyanide:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (S_N2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n4.  **Product 3 with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane:** This is a tandem alkylation reaction leading to cyclization.\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes an acidic α-hydrogen from ethyl cyanoacetate to form a carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   The excess NaH then removes the second α-hydrogen from the now mono-alkylated intermediate.\n    *   The resulting carbanion undergoes an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to form a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane\n\n### **¹H NMR Analysis of the Final Product**\n\nThe structure of the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position with both a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n*   **Conformation:** The two bulky substituents on C1 will significantly hinder the \"chair flip\" of the cyclohexane ring, meaning it will exist in a locked or slowly interconverting chair conformation. For determining the number of chemically distinct protons, we should consider this static conformation.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group. This plane makes the left and right sides of the ring equivalent.\n*   **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    1.  The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **one signal**.\n    2.  The two protons of the methylene group (-CH₂-) are adjacent to the prochiral C1 center. In many introductory contexts, these are treated as equivalent, giving **one signal**.\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   Because the ring is in a locked conformation, the axial and equatorial protons on each carbon are chemically distinct unless related by symmetry.\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    3.  **H-axial on C2 and C6:** These two protons are equivalent. (**1 signal**)\n    4.  **H-equatorial on C2 and C6:** These two protons are equivalent. (**1 signal**)\n    5.  **H-axial on C3 and C5:** These two protons are equivalent. (**1 signal**)\n    6.  **H-equatorial on C3 and C5:** These two protons are equivalent. (**1 signal**)\n    7.  **H-axial on C4:** This proton is unique and lies on the symmetry plane. (**1 signal**)\n    8.  **H-equatorial on C4:** This proton is also unique and lies on the symmetry plane. (**1 signal**)\n\n**Counting the Signals:**\nBy summing up the distinct signals, we have:\n*   1 signal from the ethyl -CH₃\n*   1 signal from the ethyl -CH₂-\n*   6 signals from the cyclohexane ring\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 6 = **8 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\nThe question notes that some signals may be close in chemical shift, which supports the detailed analysis of a locked conformation where axial and equatorial protons are distinct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
