  "question": "You want to create a mouse embryonic chimera with induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells of various tissues. You are interested in the iPSCs fate in the embryo and their co-localization with apoptotic events. The iPSC cells are labeled with a mRaspberry fused under a lineage-specific promoter for each cell type. You inject the dedifferentiated cells into the 32-cell stage blastocyst and track them over 48. Every 12 h, you prepare embryos with the TUNEL - FITC staining and observe under the confocal microscope.\n\nWhat is the first thing you notice?\n\nA) cytoplasmic localization of the red signal\nB) there is no green signal\nC) cell line-specific red signals label different organelles\nD) green signal colocalizes with the red signal\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",
