    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we must first identify the color of the light it emits and then find its complementary color.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Wavelength and Color of Emitted Light\n\nThe energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. The relationship between energy (E) and wavelength (λ) is given by the formula E = hc/λ, where 'h' is Planck's constant and 'c' is the speed of light. A commonly used conversion factor is:\n\nλ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV)\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the wavelength of the emitted light:\n\nλ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm\n\nA wavelength of approximately 530 nm falls within the green region of the visible light spectrum. Therefore, the textile dye emits green light.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Absorbed Color\n\nThe color an object appears to be is the color of the light that it reflects or transmits. The light that is absorbed is the complementary color of the light we see. In this case, since the dye emits green light, it absorbs the complementary color of green.\n\nAccording to the principles of complementary colors:\n*   The complementary color of green (500-560 nm) is red or red-violet.\n*   If a compound absorbs red light, it will appear green.\n\nTherefore, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<C>>>"
