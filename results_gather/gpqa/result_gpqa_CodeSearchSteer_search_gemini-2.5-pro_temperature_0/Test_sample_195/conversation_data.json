    "My initial derivation was based on the principle of conservation of total energy. I will verify this approach with the search results.\n\nThe total energy E of a relativistic system subject to a potential V(x) is given by the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy. A Chegg solution to a similar problem uses the Lagrangian L = -mc²√(1 - v²/c²) - V(x), where V(x) = ½kx². From this Lagrangian, the total energy (Hamiltonian) is derived as E = pẋ - L.\n\nThe canonical momentum is p = ∂L/∂ẋ = γmẋ.\nSo, E = (γmẋ)ẋ - [-mc²√(1 - v²/c²) - ½kx²]\nE = γmv² + mc²/γ - ½kx²\nE = γm(v² + c²/γ²) - ½kx²\nE = γm(v² + c²(1 - v²/c²)) - ½kx²\nE = γm(v² + c² - v²) - ½kx²\nE = γmc² + ½kx²\n\nThis confirms my initial energy expression was incorrect. The correct expression for the total conserved energy is E = γmc² + U(x). Let me re-evaluate my derivation with this corrected understanding.\n\nWait, the Chegg solution gives the Lagrangian as L = -mc²√(1-β²) - V(x). The energy is H = pẋ - L.\np = ∂L/∂ẋ = (mẋ)/√(1-β²) = γmv.\nH = (γmv)v - [-mc²/γ - V(x)] = γmv² + mc²/γ + V(x).\nSince γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²), we have 1/γ = √(1-v²/c²).\nH = γmv² + mc²√(1-v²/c²) + V(x)\nH = m(γv² + c²/γ) + V(x)\nH = mγ(v² + c²/γ²) + V(x)\nH = mγ(v² + c²(1-v²/c²)) + V(x)\nH = mγ(v² + c² - v²) + V(x)\nH = γmc² + V(x).\n\nMy initial formulation was E = γmc² + U(x). This seems to be the correct form for the total conserved energy. Let me re-do the derivation from the start to be absolutely sure.\n\n1.  **Total Conserved Energy (E_total):**\n    E_total = γmc² + U(x) = (mc² / √(1 - v²/c²)) + ½kx²\n\n2.  **Energy at maximum amplitude (x = A):**\n    At this point, the velocity v = 0.\n    Therefore, γ = 1 / √(1 - 0) = 1.\n    The potential energy is U(A) = ½kA².\n    E_total = (1)mc² + ½kA²\n\n3.  **Energy at equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n    At this point, the speed is maximum, v = v_max.\n    The potential energy is U(0) = 0.\n    The Lorentz factor is γ_max = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²).\n    E_total = γ_max * mc² + 0\n\n4.  **Equate the energies:**\n    mc² + ½kA² = γ_max * mc²\n    mc² + ½kA² = (mc² / √(1 - v_max²/c²))\n\n5.  **Solve for v_max:**\n    Divide by mc²:\n    1 + (kA²) / (2mc²) = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²)\n\n    Rearrange:\n    √(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))\n\n    Square both sides:\n    1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²\n\n    Isolate v_max²/c²:\n    v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²\n\n    Take the square root and multiply by c:\n    v_max = c * √[1 - 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²]\n\nThis derivation is consistent and leads directly to option B. The initial confusion about the energy formula (whether it's (γ-1)mc² + U or γmc² + U) stemmed from different definitions of total energy (sometimes including rest mass, sometimes not). However, as long as the same conserved quantity is used at both points in the oscillation, the result is the same. Using E = (γ-1)mc² + U also yields the same final equation, as shown in my scratchpad.\n\nThe physics seems sound, the derivation is consistent, and it correctly reduces to the classical limit. The result matches option B perfectly.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$ - Incorrect.\nB) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$ - Correct.\nC) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ - Classical limit.\nD) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$ - Incorrect.\n\nThe derivation is robust.\n\nTo solve this problem, we use the principle of conservation of energy for a relativistic particle in a potential field. The total energy E of the particle is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy, and this total energy remains constant throughout the motion.\n\n1.  **Total Energy Expression:**\n    The total conserved energy (E) of a particle of mass $m$ moving at speed $v$ in a potential $U(x)$ is given by:\n    $E = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n    where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor, $c$ is the speed of light, and $U(x)$ is the potential energy. For a harmonic oscillator with force $F = -kx$, the potential energy is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    So, the conserved energy is:\n    $E = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n2.  **Energy at Maximum Amplitude:**\n    The maximum amplitude $A$ is the turning point of the oscillation. At this point ($x = A$), the mass momentarily stops, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n    At $x = A$, we have $v = 0$, which means the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = 1$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n3.  **Energy at Equilibrium Position:**\n    The maximum speed ($v_{max}$) is achieved when the mass passes through the equilibrium position ($x = 0$). At this point, the potential energy is zero.\n    At $x = 0$, we have $v = v_{max}$ and $U(0) = 0$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} + 0$\n\n4.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    Since energy is conserved, we can equate the energy expressions from steps 2 and 3:\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n5.  **Solve for v_max:**\n    First, divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    Next, rearrange the equation to solve for the term with $v_{max}$:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Square both sides of the equation:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Rearrange to isolate $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Finally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
