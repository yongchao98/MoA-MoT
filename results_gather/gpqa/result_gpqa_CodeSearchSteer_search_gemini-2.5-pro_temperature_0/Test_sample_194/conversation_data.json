    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Understand the Conditions\n\n*   **Transit:** A planet passes in front of its star from our point of view. For a transit to occur, the system must be viewed nearly edge-on.\n*   **Occultation:** A planet passes behind its star. For a planet in a circular orbit, if a transit occurs, an occultation will also occur half an orbit later.\n*   **Impact Parameter (b):** This is the projected distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet at the point of closest approach, normalized by the stellar radius. A standard transit is considered to occur if the center of the planet passes over the star's disk, which means the impact parameter `b` must be between 0 and 1. An impact parameter of `b=1` signifies that the planet's center grazes the edge of the star.\n*   **Circular & Coplanar Orbits:** Both planets have circular orbits and share the same orbital plane, which means they have the same orbital inclination (`i`) with respect to our line of sight.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Physics\n\nThe impact parameter `b` is defined by the equation:\n\n`b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`\n\nwhere:\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `i` is the orbital inclination.\n*   `R_s` is the radius of the star.\n\n### 3. Use Information from Planet 1\n\nWe are given the following for the first planet:\n*   Orbital Period (`P1`) = 3 days\n*   Impact Parameter (`b1`) = 0.2\n\nUsing the impact parameter formula for Planet 1:\n\n`b1 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s = 0.2`\n\nThis gives us a relationship: `a1 * cos(i) = 0.2 * R_s`\n\n### 4. Determine the Limit for Planet 2\n\nWe need to find the *maximum* orbital period for the second planet that still allows for a transit. A longer period means a larger semi-major axis (`a`). The largest possible semi-major axis for a transit corresponds to the largest possible impact parameter, which is `b2 = 1`.\n\nApplying the impact parameter formula for Planet 2 at its maximum possible semi-major axis (`a2_max`):\n\n`b2_max = (a2_max * cos(i)) / R_s = 1`\n\nThis gives us the relationship: `a2_max * cos(i) = R_s`\n\n### 5. Relate the Orbits of the Two Planets\n\nNow we have two equations:\n1.  `a1 * cos(i) = 0.2 * R_s`\n2.  `a2_max * cos(i) = R_s`\n\nBy dividing the second equation by the first, we can find the ratio of their semi-major axes:\n\n`(a2_max * cos(i)) / (a1 * cos(i)) = R_s / (0.2 * R_s)`\n\nThe terms `cos(i)` and `R_s` cancel out, leaving:\n\n`a2_max / a1 = 1 / 0.2 = 5`\n\nSo, the maximum semi-major axis for the second planet is 5 times the semi-major axis of the first planet (`a2_max = 5 * a1`).\n\n### 6. Apply Kepler's Third Law\n\nKepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`).\n\n`P² ∝ a³`\n\nWe can write this as a ratio for our two planets:\n\n`(P2_max / P1)² = (a2_max / a1)³`\n\nNow, substitute the known values:\n*   `P1 = 3` days\n*   `a2_max / a1 = 5`\n\n`(P2_max / 3)² = (5)³`\n`(P2_max / 3)² = 125`\n\n### 7. Calculate the Final Answer\n\nTo solve for `P2_max`, we first take the square root of both sides:\n\n`P2_max / 3 = √125`\n`P2_max / 3 = √(25 * 5) = 5√5`\n\nNow, multiply by 3:\n\n`P2_max = 3 * 5√5 = 15√5`\n\nUsing the approximation `√5 ≈ 2.236`:\n\n`P2_max ≈ 15 * 2.236 = 33.54` days\n\nThis value is approximately 33.5 days. The radii of the planets were not needed for this calculation, as the standard definition of a transit event relies on the impact parameter of the planet's center.\n\n<<<A>>>"
