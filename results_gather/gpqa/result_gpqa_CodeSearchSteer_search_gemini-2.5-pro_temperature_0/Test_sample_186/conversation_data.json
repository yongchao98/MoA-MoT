    "Based on the capabilities of the ESPRESSO spectrograph and the location of the Paranal Observatory, three of the listed stars would be detectable.\n\nTo determine detectability, two main criteria must be met:\n1.  **Apparent Magnitude:** The star must be bright enough for ESPRESSO to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 in a one-hour exposure. When coupled with a single 8m VLT telescope (1-UT mode), ESPRESSO can reach this S/N for stars with an apparent visual magnitude (V) of about 17.\n2.  **Declination (Observability):** The star must be visible from the Paranal Observatory in Chile. The observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. This means it can observe stars with declinations roughly between +65 and -90 degrees.\n\nHere is a star-by-star analysis:\n\n*   **a) Canopus:**\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude:** -0.74, making it the second brightest star in the night sky. This is significantly brighter than the V=17 limit.\n    *   **Declination:** Approximately -52° 41'. This is well within the observable range for Paranal.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n*   **b) Polaris (the North Star):**\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude:** Approximately 1.98. This is bright enough for ESPRESSO.\n    *   **Declination:** Approximately +89° 15'. As the North Star, it is located very close to the north celestial pole and is not visible from the Southern Hemisphere location of the Paranal Observatory.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Not detectable.**\n\n*   **c) Star with M=15 at 10 pc:**\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude (m):** Calculated using the formula m = M + 5*log₁₀(d) - 5, where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs.\n        *   m = 15 + 5*log₁₀(10) - 5 = 15 + 5(1) - 5 = 15.\n    *   **Declination:** 0°, which is on the celestial equator and easily observable from Paranal.\n    *   **Conclusion:** With an apparent magnitude of 15, it is brighter than the V=17 limit and has an observable declination. **Detectable.**\n\n*   **d) Star with M=15 at 200 pc:**\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude (m):**\n        *   m = 15 + 5*log₁₀(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5(2.301) - 5 = 15 + 11.5 - 5 = 21.5.\n    *   **Declination:** 0°.\n    *   **Conclusion:** With an apparent magnitude of 21.5, it is too faint for ESPRESSO to achieve the required S/N in one hour. **Not detectable.**\n\n*   **e) Star with M=15 at 5 pc:**\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude (m):**\n        *   m = 15 + 5*log₁₀(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5(0.699) - 5 = 15 + 3.5 - 5 = 13.5.\n    *   **Declination:** 0°.\n    *   **Conclusion:** With an apparent magnitude of 13.5, it is well within the detection limit. **Detectable.**\n\n*   **f) Star with M=15 at 50 pc:**\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude (m):**\n        *   m = 15 + 5*log₁₀(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5(1.699) - 5 = 15 + 8.5 - 5 = 18.5.\n    *   **Declination:** 0°.\n    *   **Conclusion:** With an apparent magnitude of 18.5, it is too faint. **Not detectable.**\n\nIn total, Canopus and the hypothetical stars at 10 pc and 5 pc are detectable, making for a total of 3 stars.\n\n<<<C>>>"
