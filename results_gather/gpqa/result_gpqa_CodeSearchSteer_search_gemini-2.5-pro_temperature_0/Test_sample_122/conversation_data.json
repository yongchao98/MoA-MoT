    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the knowns:**\n    *   The relative velocity (v) between the ejecta's frame and the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time that passes in the ejecta's reference frame (the moving frame) is Δt₀ = 50 s. This is the \"proper time\".\n    *   The speed of light (c) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n2.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   Calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (the stationary frame).\n\n3.  **Apply the theory of special relativity:**\n    *   According to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure a longer time interval for events happening in a moving frame. This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is given by the formula: `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor relates the time in the two reference frames. It is calculated as:\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n        v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n    *   Now, substitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)\n    *   Calculating the value:\n        γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206\n\n5.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n    *   The time dilation formula is: Δt = γ * Δt₀\n    *   Δt ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s\n    *   Δt ≈ 51.03 s\n\n6.  **Calculate the distance in the Galaxy's frame (d):**\n    *   Now use the distance formula with the time calculated for the Galaxy's frame:\n        d = v * Δt\n    *   d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s\n    *   d ≈ 3,061,800 km\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    *   The calculated distance of approximately 3,061,800 km is closest to option B.\n\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km is the non-relativistic answer (60,000 km/s * 50 s).\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km is the closest to our calculated relativistic distance.\n    *   C) 2,880,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km would be the result of incorrectly multiplying by the Lorentz factor instead of dividing.\n\nTherefore, the correct distance traveled in the Galaxy reference frame is approximately 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<B>>>"
