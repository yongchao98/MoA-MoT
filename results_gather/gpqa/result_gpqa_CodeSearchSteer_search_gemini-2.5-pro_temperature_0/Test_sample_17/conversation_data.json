    "To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we must first calculate the silicon abundance for each star relative to hydrogen. The standard notation for elemental abundance in astrophysics is `[A/B]`, which is defined as the logarithmic ratio of the number densities (n) of elements A and B in a star compared to the Sun.\n\nThe formula is:\n`[A/B] = log10( (n_A / n_B)_star ) - log10( (n_A / n_B)_sun )`\n\nA key property of this notation is that abundances relative to different elements can be related. For instance, the abundance of silicon relative to hydrogen, `[Si/H]`, can be derived from the abundance of silicon relative to iron, `[Si/Fe]`, and the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen, `[Fe/H]`, using the following identity:\n`[Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H]`\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Silicon Abundance of Star_1**\n\nWe are given the following for Star_1:\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3` dex\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0` dex\n\nUsing the identity mentioned above, we can find the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio for Star_1:\n`[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1`\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\nBy the definition of the bracket notation, this means:\n`log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) = 0.3`\n`log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) = 0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun )`\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Silicon Abundance of Star_2**\n\nFor Star_2, we are given:\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3` dex\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0` dex\n\nWe can use a similar identity to relate the abundances of magnesium, silicon, and hydrogen:\n`[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2`\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio for Star_2, `[Si/H]_2`:\n`[Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2`\n`[Si/H]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3`\n\nFrom the definition of the bracket notation:\n`log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) = -0.3`\n`log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) = -0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun )`\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Ratio of Silicon Atoms**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of the two stars. This corresponds to the ratio of their silicon number densities relative to hydrogen: `(n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`.\n\nTo find this ratio, we can subtract the logarithmic abundance of Star_2 from that of Star_1:\n`log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) = (0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun )) - (-0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ))`\n\nThe solar silicon abundance term cancels out:\n`log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) = 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6`\n\nTo find the final ratio, we take the antilogarithm (10 to the power of 0.6):\nRatio = 10^0.6\n\nCalculating this value gives:\nRatio â‰ˆ 3.981\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9. The masses of the stars and the specific solar abundances of iron and magnesium are extra information not needed for the final calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
