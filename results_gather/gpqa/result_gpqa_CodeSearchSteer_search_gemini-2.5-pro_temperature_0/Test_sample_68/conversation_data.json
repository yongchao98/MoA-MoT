    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:**\n    *   Due to relativistic effects, the lifetime of the particle X⁰ in the laboratory frame (the bubble chamber) is longer than its proper lifetime (τ₀). This is called time dilation.\n    *   The distance the particle travels before decaying is called the decay length. We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe the tracks of at least 30% of these decays.\n    *   The number of particles that decay follows an exponential decay law.\n\n2.  **Calculate Relativistic Parameters:**\n    *   The total energy (E) of the particle is given by E = γm₀c², where γ is the Lorentz factor and m₀ is the rest mass. In particle physics units, this simplifies to E = γm₀.\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ):\n        γ = E / m₀ = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n    *   The momentum (p) of the particle can be calculated from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)².\n    *   Momentum-energy (pc):\n        pc = √(E² - m₀²) = √(27² - 3.41²) GeV = √(729 - 11.6281) GeV = √717.3719 GeV ≈ 26.78 GeV\n    *   The particle's velocity is v = βc, where β = p/E = 26.78 / 27 ≈ 0.9918. The particle is highly relativistic.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L):**\n    *   The lifetime in the lab frame (τ) is dilated: τ = γτ₀.\n    *   The mean decay length (L) is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying: L = vτ = (βc)(γτ₀).\n    *   A more direct formula for the mean decay length is L = (pc / m₀c²) * cτ₀.\n    *   Let's calculate L:\n        L = (26.78 GeV / 3.41 GeV) * (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s)\n        L ≈ 7.853 * (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m)\n        L ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n4.  **Determine the Required Resolution (R):**\n    *   To \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track length (d) must be greater than the detector's resolution (R).\n    *   We need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means the probability of the decay length being greater than the resolution must be at least 0.3.\n        P(d > R) ≥ 0.3\n    *   The probability of a particle surviving a distance R follows the exponential decay law: P(d > R) = e^(-R/L).\n    *   So, we set the condition for the threshold resolution:\n        e^(-R/L) = 0.3\n    *   Solving for R:\n        -R/L = ln(0.3)\n        R = -L * ln(0.3)\n        R ≈ -(1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204)\n        R ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   Our calculated required resolution is R ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m. This value represents the largest possible resolution (i.e., the \"worst\" resolution) that can still detect at least 30% of the decays. Any detector with a better (smaller) resolution will also satisfy the condition.\n    *   Let's examine the given options:\n        A) 2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m\n        B) 2.08 × 10⁻¹ m\n        C) 2.08 × 10⁻³ m\n        D) 2.08 × 10⁻⁹ m\n    *   Our calculated value (2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m) is very close to option A (2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m). The other options are different by several orders of magnitude. The small discrepancy (about 9%) is likely due to a typo in the problem's given values. For instance, if the mass of X⁰ were 3.72 GeV instead of 3.41 GeV, the calculation would yield R ≈ 2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m precisely.\n    *   Given the choices, option A is the only physically plausible answer. A resolution of 2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m is sufficient to observe approximately 33% of the decays, which meets the \"at least 30%\" criterion.\n\nFinal Answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
