    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum over all possible states of the system. The partition function is defined as:\n\nZ = Σ_states * e^(-βE)\n\nwhere β = 1/(kT), and E is the energy of a given state. The energy of the system is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\nEach spin can take a value of +1 or -1, leading to a total of 2³ = 8 possible configurations for the system (S1, S2, S3). We need to calculate the energy for each of these states.\n\nLet's list all 8 possible states and their corresponding energies:\n\n1.  **All spins up:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n2.  **All spins down:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n    These two states are degenerate, meaning they have the same energy level.\n    *   Energy E₁ = -3J, with degeneracy g₁ = 2.\n\n3.  **Two spins up, one spin down:** There are three such configurations:\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1)\n        E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1)\n        E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1)\n        E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\n4.  **One spin up, two spins down:** There are three such configurations:\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1)\n        E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1)\n        E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1)\n        E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\n    All six of these states are degenerate.\n    *   Energy E₂ = J, with degeneracy g₂ = 6.\n\nNow, we can write the partition function by summing the contributions from each energy level, weighted by their degeneracies:\n\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n\nThe calculated partition function matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
