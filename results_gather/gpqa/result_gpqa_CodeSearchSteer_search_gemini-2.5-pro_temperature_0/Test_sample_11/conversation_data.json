    "The problem asks for the kinetic energies of the muon (μ+) and the neutrino (ν) resulting from the decay of a stationary positive pion (π+).\n\nThe decay process is: π+ → μ+ + ν\n\nGiven:\n*   Rest mass of π+ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of μ+ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   The neutrino (ν) is treated as massless (m_ν = 0).\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation based on the principles of conservation of energy and momentum:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the products must be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude (p).\n    *   p_μ = p_ν = p\n\n2.  **Conservation of Energy**: The initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion. This must equal the sum of the total energies of the decay products.\n    *   E_π = E_μ + E_ν\n    *   m_πc² = (KE_μ + m_μc²) + E_ν\n\n3.  **Energy and Momentum of Products**:\n    *   For the massless neutrino, its energy is entirely kinetic and is given by E_ν = KE_ν = pc.\n    *   The total energy of the muon is related to its momentum and rest mass by the relativistic formula: E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)². Its kinetic energy is KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc².\n\n4.  **Solving for Momentum**: We can express the total energy of the muon in terms of the pion's rest energy and the neutrino's energy: E_μ = m_πc² - E_ν = m_πc² - pc. Now, substitute this into the relativistic energy-momentum equation for the muon:\n    *   (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)(pc)\n    *   pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n\n5.  **Calculating the Values**:\n    *   pc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n    *   pc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n    *   pc = 8315.67 / 279.2\n    *   pc ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\n6.  **Finding the Kinetic Energies**:\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν)**: Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its momentum multiplied by c.\n        *   KE_ν = pc ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ)**: We can find this by subtracting the other energies from the initial energy.\n        *   KE_μ = m_πc² - m_μc² - KE_ν\n        *   KE_μ = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV - 29.8 MeV\n        *   KE_μ = 4.1 MeV.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches one of the provided options.\n\n<<<C>>>"
