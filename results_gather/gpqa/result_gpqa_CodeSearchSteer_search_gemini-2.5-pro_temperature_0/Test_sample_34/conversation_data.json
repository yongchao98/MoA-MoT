    "To determine the correct statement, we must first analyze the operator `Ay` for the muon's intrinsic angular momentum (spin).\n\n1.  **Define the Operator `Ay`**:\n    The operator is given by `Ay = c∙S`, where `c = h / (4π)` and the matrix `S` is `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    The constant `c` can be rewritten in terms of the reduced Planck constant, `ħ = h / (2π)`. Thus, `c = ħ / 2`.\n    The matrix `S` is the Pauli matrix for the y-component of spin, `σ_y`.\n    So, the operator is `Ay = (ħ/2) * σ_y = [[0, -iħ/2], [iħ/2, 0]]`. This is a standard representation for the y-component of a spin-1/2 particle's angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Eigenvalues of `Ay`**:\n    To find the eigenvalues `a`, we solve the characteristic equation `det(Ay - a*I) = 0`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n    `det([[ -a, -iħ/2], [iħ/2, -a]]) = 0`\n    `(-a)(-a) - (-iħ/2)(iħ/2) = 0`\n    `a² - (-i² * ħ²/4) = 0`\n    Since `i² = -1`, this becomes:\n    `a² - (ħ²/4) = 0`\n    `a² = ħ²/4`\n    The eigenvalues are `a = ± ħ/2`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Eigenvalues**:\n    The eigenvalues are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`. Since `ħ = h / (2π)`, the eigenvalues are `+h/(4π)` and `-h/(4π)`. These are purely real numbers.\n    *   This immediately shows that statements **C** and **D** are incorrect, as they claim the eigenvalues have non-zero imaginary parts.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Eigenfunctions (Eigenvectors)**:\n    *   **Statement B**: This statement claims the eigenfunctions of `Ay` are the basis functions of the matrix operator. The matrix `Ay` is written in the standard basis (also known as the `Az` or `Sz` eigenbasis), which is `[[1], [0]]` and `[[0], [1]]`. The eigenvectors of `Ay` are different. For `a = +ħ/2`, the eigenvector is proportional to `[[1], [i]]`, and for `a = -ħ/2`, it is proportional to `[[1], [-i]]`. Therefore, statement **B** is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Statement A**: This statement has two parts:\n        1.  *The eigenfunction of `Ay` can also be an eigenfunction of `A²`*: The operator `A²` (or `S²`) represents the square of the total spin angular momentum. For any spin-1/2 particle, `A²` is a multiple of the identity matrix (`A² = s(s+1)ħ² * I = (3/4)ħ² * I`). Any vector is an eigenvector of a matrix that is a multiple of the identity matrix. Thus, the eigenfunctions of `Ay` are also eigenfunctions of `A²`.\n        2.  *...but not of the Z-component, `Az`*: In quantum mechanics, operators that do not commute cannot share a complete set of eigenfunctions. The spin component operators have the commutation relation `[Ay, Az] = iħAx`. Since `Ay` and `Az` do not commute, they do not share eigenfunctions. An eigenfunction of `Ay` will not be an eigenfunction of `Az`.\n\n    Both parts of statement A are correct based on the fundamental principles of angular momentum in quantum mechanics.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe eigenvalues of `Ay` are real (`±ħ/2`), making C and D incorrect. The eigenfunctions of `Ay` are distinct from the standard basis vectors, making B incorrect. Statement A correctly describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of `Ay`, `A²`, and `Az` based on their commutation relations.\n\n<<<A>>>"
