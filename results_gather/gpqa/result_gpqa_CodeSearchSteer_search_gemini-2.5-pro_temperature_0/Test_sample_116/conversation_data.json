    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Optical isomerism in biphenyls can arise from a phenomenon called atropisomerism, which occurs when rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. This restriction is typically caused by bulky substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions are occupied by large nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups. These bulky groups prevent the two rings from becoming coplanar, leading to a stable, chiral conformation. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable, meaning they are enantiomers and the compound will exhibit optical activity.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is known as a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and will have two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), thus exhibiting optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. It does not have a carbon atom with four different substituents. The molecule itself is achiral; while it can crystallize in a chiral form, the individual molecule is not chiral in solution or gas phases. It possesses a plane of symmetry, making it superimposable on its mirror image and therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of a butenedioic acid ester. It has a double bond and is a planar molecule. It possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry. There are no chiral centers in the molecule. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
