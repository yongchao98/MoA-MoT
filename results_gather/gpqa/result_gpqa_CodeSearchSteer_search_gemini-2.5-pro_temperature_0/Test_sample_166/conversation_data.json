    "To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the given Schrödinger cat state, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the State and Parameters:**\n    The Schrödinger cat state is given by `|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`.\n    The specific parameters are `phi = -pi / 4` and `alpha = 0.5`.\n    For these parameters, `cos(-pi/4) = 1/sqrt(2)` and `sin(-pi/4) = -1/sqrt(2)`. The state becomes `|psi> = (1/(sqrt(2)N)) * (|alpha> - |-alpha>)`.\n    The normalization constant is `N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2))`. With `sin(2*(-pi/4)) = sin(-pi/2) = -1`, we get `N = sqrt(1 - exp(-2*alpha^2))`.\n\n2.  **Define the Non-Gaussianity Measure:**\n    The measure is the relative entropy `del_b = trace(rho * ln(rho)) - trace(rho * ln(tau))`.\n    This can be rewritten as `del_b = S(tau) - S(rho)`, where `S(rho) = -trace(rho * ln(rho))` is the von Neumann entropy.\n    The state `|psi>` is a pure state, so its density matrix is `rho = |psi><psi|`. The entropy of any pure state is `S(rho) = 0`.\n    Therefore, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state: `del_b = S(tau)`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reference Gaussian State `tau`:**\n    The reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments (mean displacement and covariance matrix) as the state `rho`.\n    *   **First Moment (Displacement):** The mean displacement `<a>_rho` is zero due to the symmetry of the state `|psi>`.\n    *   **Second Moments:** We need to calculate `<a^2>_rho` and `<a^\\dagger a>_rho`.\n        *   It can be shown that for this state, `<a^2>_rho = alpha^2`.\n        *   The mean photon number is `<a^\\dagger a>_rho = |alpha|^2 * (1 + exp(-2|alpha|^2)) / (1 - exp(-2|alpha|^2))`.\n\n4.  **Characterize the Reference State `tau`:**\n    Since the displacement is zero but the squeezing-like term `<a^2>_rho = alpha^2 = 0.25` is non-zero, the reference state `tau` is not a simple thermal state but a **squeezed thermal state**.\n    A squeezed thermal state `tau` is generated by applying a squeezing operator to a thermal state `nu(n_th)`. Crucially, the entropy of the squeezed thermal state is the same as the entropy of the underlying thermal state `nu(n_th)`. So, `S(tau) = S(nu(n_th))`.\n\n5.  **Find the Parameters of `tau`:**\n    We need to find the mean photon number `n_th` of the underlying thermal state `nu(n_th)` that, when squeezed, matches the moments of `rho`. By equating the moments of `rho` with the general expressions for the moments of a squeezed thermal state, we can solve for `n_th`.\n    The relevant equations are:\n    *   `<a^\\dagger a>_rho = n_th * cosh(2r) + sinh^2(r)`\n    *   `<a^2>_rho = (2n_th + 1) * sinh(r)cosh(r)`\n    Solving this system of equations for our specific `alpha = 0.5` yields `n_th` is almost exactly 1.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Entropy `S(tau)`:**\n    The entropy of the reference state `tau` is the entropy of the underlying thermal state `nu(n_th)` with `n_th = 1`.\n    The von Neumann entropy of a thermal state is given by the formula:\n    `S(nu(n_th)) = (n_th + 1) * ln(n_th + 1) - n_th * ln(n_th)`.\n    Substituting `n_th = 1`:\n    `S(tau) = (1 + 1) * ln(1 + 1) - 1 * ln(1)`\n    `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 0`\n    `S(tau) = 2 * 0.6931...`\n    `S(tau) ≈ 1.386`\n\n7.  **Final Result:**\n    The non-Gaussianity `del_b` is equal to `S(tau)`.\n    `del_b ≈ 1.386`.\n\nThis value corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
