    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by observing the \"wobble\" of their host star. A planet's gravitational pull causes its star to move in a small orbit around their common center of mass. This movement causes a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines due to the Doppler effect. When the star moves towards us, its light is blueshifted; when it moves away, it is redshifted. The maximum velocity of this wobble along our line of sight is called the radial velocity semi-amplitude, denoted as K.\n\n### 2. Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity\n\nThe observed periodic shift in the wavelength of a spectral line (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n\nGiven:\n*   Maximum wavelength shift for star 1 (Δλ₁): 5 milliangstroms\n*   Maximum wavelength shift for star 2 (Δλ₂): 7 milliangstroms\n\nSince K is proportional to Δλ_max, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:\nK₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n### 3. Use the Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0) is:\n\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   m_p is the planet's mass.\n*   M_star is the star's mass.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 4. Simplify the Formula Based on the Given Information\n\nThe problem provides the following key details:\n*   The stars have the same mass: M_star1 = M_star2.\n*   The planets have similar masses, like Neptune: m_p1 ≈ m_p2.\n*   The orbits are circular: e=0.\n\nThe term m_p * sin(i) represents the \"minimum mass\" that can be measured by the RV method, as the inclination 'i' is often unknown. The problem states the *planets'* masses are similar, which implies we can assume the term (m_p * sin(i)) is constant for both systems.\n\nWith these simplifications, most terms in the formula become constant for both planets. The relationship between K and P simplifies to:\n\nK ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n### 5. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nWe can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nNow, we can solve for the ratio of the periods (P₂ / P₁):\n\nP₁ / P₂ = (K₂ / K₁)^3\n\nWe want to find how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁.\n\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / (K₂ / K₁)^3 = (K₁ / K₂)^3\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3\n\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.36\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
