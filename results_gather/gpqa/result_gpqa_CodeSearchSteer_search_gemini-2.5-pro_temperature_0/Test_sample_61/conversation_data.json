    "The synthesis of 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane requires a multi-step process. The target molecule is the result of a self-aldol condensation of two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Therefore, the primary goal of the initial steps is to synthesize cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\nThe correct sequence of reactions is outlined in option C, which involves four main transformations:\n\n1.  **Alkylation of the alkyne:** Ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne, meaning it has an acidic proton on the triple-bonded carbon. Sodium amide (NaNH2), a very strong base, is used to deprotonate the alkyne, forming a sodium acetylide anion. This anion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking methyl chloride (CH3Cl) to form a new carbon-carbon bond, yielding 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n\n2.  **Partial reduction to an alkene:** The internal alkyne is then reduced to a *cis*-alkene, (Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene. This is achieved using hydrogen gas (H2) with a poisoned catalyst, specifically palladium on calcium carbonate (Pd-CaCO3), also known as Lindlar's catalyst. This catalyst is crucial because it is selective for the reduction of alkynes to alkenes and prevents over-reduction to an alkane. The syn-addition of hydrogen across the triple bond results in the formation of the *cis* (or Z) isomer.\n\n3.  **Ozonolysis:** The double bond of the alkene is cleaved using ozone (O3), followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide ((CH3)2S). This reaction breaks the C=C bond and forms two separate carbonyl compounds. In this case, the cleavage of (Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene yields cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and acetaldehyde. The reductive workup ensures that aldehydes are the final products, rather than carboxylic acids.\n\n4.  **Aldol Condensation:** The final step is an aldol condensation reaction using barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2) as a base. In the mixture of aldehydes produced in the previous step, the more volatile acetaldehyde (boiling point 20.2 Â°C) can be removed. The remaining cyclohexanecarbaldehyde then undergoes a self-condensation reaction, where one molecule acts as a nucleophile (forming an enolate) and the other as an electrophile, to yield the final product, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n*   **Option A:** The ozonolysis step uses a water (H2O) workup, which is oxidative and would produce carboxylic acids instead of the required aldehydes.\n*   **Option B:** The first step incorrectly lists methanol as a reagent instead of an alkyl halide. NaNH2 would react with methanol in an acid-base reaction, preventing the desired alkylation.\n*   **Option D:** The second step uses H2/Pd, which would fully reduce the alkyne to an alkane (propylcyclohexane), making the subsequent steps impossible.\n\n<<<C>>>"
