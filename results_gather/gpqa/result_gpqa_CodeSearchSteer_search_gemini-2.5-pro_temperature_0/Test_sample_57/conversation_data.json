    "To determine which physical theory does not require regularization at high energies, we must examine the behavior of each theory when dealing with calculations involving very high energies or, equivalently, very short distances. Regularization is a technique used to handle infinities, known as ultraviolet (UV) divergences, that arise in such calculations.\n\n*   **B) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** As the first successful quantum field theory, QED describes the interaction between light and matter. However, its calculations are plagued by infinities that require regularization and a subsequent process called renormalization to yield finite, physically meaningful results. Various regularization schemes are employed in QED to manage these divergences.\n\n*   **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** QCD is the theory of the strong force, which binds quarks together. Much like QED, QCD is a quantum field theory that suffers from ultraviolet divergences in its perturbative calculations. To make sense of the theory, these infinities must be tamed using regularization methods, such as lattice QCD, which discretizes spacetime to provide a natural cutoff.\n\n*   **C) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory predates quantum mechanics and describes macroscopic electromagnetic phenomena. While it is not a quantum field theory and thus lacks the loop-diagram divergences of QED and QCD, it has its own problem with infinities. Specifically, the self-energy of a classical point-like charged particle, such as an electron, is infinite. This short-distance divergence implies that the theory is incomplete and requires some form of regularization, like assuming the particle has a finite size, to avoid this unphysical infinity.\n\n*   **A) Superstring Theory:** A primary motivation for superstring theory is to resolve the conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics and to provide a quantum theory of gravity. A key feature of superstring theory is that it is believed to be free from ultraviolet (UV) divergences. Unlike point-particle theories, strings are extended objects, which has the effect of \"smearing out\" interactions at very short distances. This prevents the infinities that plague other quantum theories from appearing in the first place. Consequently, it is considered a UV-finite theory that does not require regularization.\n\nBased on this analysis, Superstring Theory is the only option listed that is formulated to be inherently free from high-energy divergences, thus not requiring regularization.\n\n<<<A>>>"
