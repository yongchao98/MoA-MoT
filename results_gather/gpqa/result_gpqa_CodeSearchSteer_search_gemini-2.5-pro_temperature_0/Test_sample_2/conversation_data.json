    "To determine the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x, we can calculate the expectation values for σ_z and σ_x separately and then combine them. The expectation value of an operator A for a state |ψ⟩ is given by ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩.\n\nThe given state of the spin-half particle is:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩\n\nIn matrix notation, the spin states and Pauli matrices are represented as follows:\n*   The spin-up state |↑⟩ is the vectorᵀ.\n*   The spin-down state |↓⟩ is the vectorᵀ.\n*   The Pauli matrix σ_z is [, [0, -1]].\n*   The Pauli matrix σ_x is [,].\n\nThe state vector |ψ⟩ can be written as:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5 *ᵀ + (√3)/2 *ᵀ = [0.5, √3/2]ᵀ\n\nThe corresponding bra vector ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose:\n⟨ψ| = [0.5, √3/2]\n\n**1. Calculate the expectation value of σ_z:**\nThe expectation value ⟨σ_z⟩ is calculated as ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩.\nFirst, we apply σ_z to |ψ⟩:\nσ_z|ψ⟩ = [, [0, -1]] * [0.5, √3/2]ᵀ = [0.5, -√3/2]ᵀ\n\nNext, we compute the inner product with ⟨ψ|:\n⟨σ_z⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [0.5, -√3/2]ᵀ\n⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5 * 0.5) + (√3/2 * -√3/2)\n⟨σ_z⟩ = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\n**2. Calculate the expectation value of σ_x:**\nThe expectation value ⟨σ_x⟩ is calculated as ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩.\nFirst, we apply σ_x to |ψ⟩:\nσ_x|ψ⟩ = [,] * [0.5, √3/2]ᵀ = [√3/2, 0.5]ᵀ\n\nNext, we compute the inner product with ⟨ψ|:\n⟨σ_x⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5]ᵀ\n⟨σ_x⟩ = (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5)\n⟨σ_x⟩ = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2\n\n**3. Calculate the final expectation value:**\nThe expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x is given by the linearity of expectation values:\n⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩.\n⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)\n⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = -5 + 2.5 * √3\n\nUsing the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732\n⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33\n⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ ≈ -0.67\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the value is -0.7.\n\n<<<A>>>"
