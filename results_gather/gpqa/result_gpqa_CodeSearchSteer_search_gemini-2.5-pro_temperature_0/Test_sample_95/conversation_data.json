    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole.\n\n**1. Given Information:**\n*   Distance to the galaxy (d) = 10¹⁰ parsecs\n*   Angular size of the event horizon (θ) = 10⁻¹⁷ degrees\n\n**2. Convert Units to SI:**\n*   First, convert the distance from parsecs to meters. One parsec is approximately 3.086 x 10¹⁶ meters.\n    *   d = 10¹⁰ pc * (3.086 x 10¹⁶ m/pc) = 3.086 x 10²⁶ m\n*   Next, convert the angular size from degrees to radians, which is necessary for the small-angle approximation.\n    *   θ = 10⁻¹⁷ degrees * (π / 180 radians/degree) ≈ 1.745 x 10⁻¹⁹ radians\n\n**3. Calculate the Size of the Event Horizon:**\n*   The diameter (D) of the event horizon can be found using the small-angle formula: D = d * θ.\n    *   D ≈ (3.086 x 10²⁶ m) * (1.745 x 10⁻¹⁹) ≈ 5.385 x 10⁷ m\n*   The radius of the event horizon (R_s) is half of the diameter.\n    *   R_s = D / 2 ≈ 2.69 x 10⁷ m\n\n**4. Calculate the Area of the Event Horizon:**\n*   The area (A) of the event horizon, which is a sphere, is given by the formula A = 4πR_s².\n    *   A = 4 * π * (2.69 x 10⁷ m)² ≈ 9.1 x 10¹⁵ m²\n\n**5. Calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy:**\n*   The entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula: S = (k_B * A) / (4 * l_P²), where k_B is the Boltzmann constant and l_P is the Planck length.\n*   The values of the physical constants are:\n    *   Boltzmann constant (k_B) ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n    *   Planck length (l_P) ≈ 1.616 x 10⁻³⁵ m.\n*   Now, calculate l_P²:\n    *   l_P² ≈ (1.616 x 10⁻³⁵ m)² ≈ 2.61 x 10⁻⁷⁰ m²\n*   Finally, substitute the values into the entropy formula:\n    *   S ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K * 9.1 x 10¹⁵ m²) / (4 * 2.61 x 10⁻⁷⁰ m²)\n    *   S ≈ (12.56 x 10⁻⁸ J/K·m²) / (10.44 x 10⁻⁷⁰ m²)\n    *   S ≈ 1.2 x 10⁶² J/K\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculated entropy is approximately 1.2 x 10⁶² J/K. The order of magnitude is 10⁶², which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
