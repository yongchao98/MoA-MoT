    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics for binary star systems. The total mass of a spectroscopic binary system is related to its orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K) of its component stars.\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the sum of the masses of the two stars (M_total) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nM_total = M₁ + M₂ = [P / (2πG)] * (K₁ + K₂)³ / sin³(i)\n\nWhere:\n*   **P** is the orbital period.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n*   **K₁** and **K₂** are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities for the two stars.\n*   **i** is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a crucial piece of information, as it implies that we are viewing the orbits nearly edge-on. For an eclipsing binary, the inclination angle *i* is very close to 90°, which means sin(i) is approximately 1, and therefore sin³(i) is also approximately 1. This simplifies the mass calculation significantly.\n\nLet's calculate the necessary values for each system:\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₁): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₂): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M_sys1) to the total mass of system_2 (M_sys2).\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = { [P₁ / (2πG)] * (K_total₁)³ } / { [P₂ / (2πG)] * (K_total₂)³ }\n\nThe constant term [1 / (2πG)] cancels out, leaving:\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = (P₁ / P₂) * (K_total₁ / K_total₂)³\n\nPlugging in the values for each system:\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = (2 years / 1 year) * (15 km/s / 25 km/s)³\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (3/5)³\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 54 / 125\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 0.432\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) ~ 0.7\nB) ~ 0.4\nC) ~ 1.2\nD) ~ 0.6\n\nThe result of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
