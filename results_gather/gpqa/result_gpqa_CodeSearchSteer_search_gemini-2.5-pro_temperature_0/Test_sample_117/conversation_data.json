    "The reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine is an example of alpha-halogenation of a ketone via its enol tautomer.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Keto-Enol Tautomerism**: The starting material, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, is an enol. Enols exist in equilibrium with their corresponding ketone (or aldehyde) forms. In this case, the enol is in equilibrium with 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Although the equilibrium typically favors the ketone, the enol form is highly reactive.\n\n2.  **Electrophilic Attack**: The double bond of the enol is electron-rich and acts as a nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic bromine molecule (Brâ‚‚).\n\n3.  **Formation of the Product**: This attack leads to the addition of a bromine atom to the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group, which was C2 in the enol). A subsequent deprotonation step regenerates the carbonyl group. The overall result is the substitution of an alpha-hydrogen with a bromine atom.\n\nThe alpha-carbons in 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone are at positions 2 and 5, which are equivalent. Therefore, the bromine atom will add to one of these positions. The carbon at position 4 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to two methyl groups and two other carbons) and has no hydrogen to be substituted.\n\nBased on this mechanism, the major product is **2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol and B) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol would be products of an electrophilic addition to a simple alkene, not the reaction of an enol.\n*   C) **2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone** is the correct alpha-halogenated ketone.\n*   D) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone is incorrect as bromination does not occur at the quaternary carbon C4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
