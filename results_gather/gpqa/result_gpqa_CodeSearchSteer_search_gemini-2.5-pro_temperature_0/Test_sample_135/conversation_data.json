    "This problem can be solved using the Divergence Theorem, also known as Gauss's Theorem. The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field **f** over a volume V is equal to the surface integral of the field over the closed surface S that encloses the volume.\n\nThe vector field is given as **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction. We need to evaluate ∫∇⋅**f** dV over a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem is expressed as:\n\n∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮∮_S (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n\n1.  **Identify the components for the surface integral:**\n    *   The vector field on the surface of the sphere (where r = R) is **f** = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n    *   The differential surface area element d**S** for a sphere in spherical coordinates is d**S** = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**. The direction is the outward normal, which is the radial direction **r̂**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the dot product **f** ⋅ d**S**:\n    *   **f** ⋅ d**S** = [(1/R²) **r̂**] ⋅ [R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**]\n    *   Since **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1, the R² terms cancel out, leaving: sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the surface integral:**\n    *   The integral becomes ∮∮_S sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n    *   The limits of integration for a full sphere are from 0 to 2π for the azimuthal angle φ, and from 0 to π for the polar angle θ.\n    *   ∫₀²π dφ ∫₀π sin(θ) dθ\n    *   The integral of dφ from 0 to 2π is 2π.\n    *   The integral of sin(θ) from 0 to π is [-cos(θ)] from 0 to π, which is (-(-1)) - (-1) = 2.\n    *   Multiplying these results gives 2π * 2 = 4π.\n\n**Method 2: Direct Calculation of the Divergence**\n\n1.  **Calculate the divergence of **f**:**\n    *   In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a purely radial field f_r **r̂** is given by ∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂(r² f_r)/∂r.\n    *   Here, f_r = 1/r².\n    *   ∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂(r² * (1/r²))/∂r = (1/r²) ∂(1)/∂r = 0.\n\n2.  **Address the singularity at the origin:**\n    *   The calculation above is valid for all r ≠ 0. At the origin (r = 0), the field is undefined, creating a singularity.\n    *   The divergence of the field **r̂**/r² is not zero everywhere; it is more accurately described by the Dirac delta function: ∇ ⋅ (**r̂**/r²) = 4πδ³(**r**), where δ³(**r**) is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function. This function is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it is infinite, and its integral over any volume containing the origin is 1.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the volume integral:**\n    *   ∫_V (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∫_V 4πδ³(**r**) dV\n    *   Since the sphere of radius R is centered at the origin, it contains the point where the delta function is non-zero.\n    *   The integral becomes 4π ∫_V δ³(**r**) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The volume integral of the divergence of the given field is 4π. This is a classic result in physics, particularly in electromagnetism, where it relates to Gauss's law for the electric field of a point charge.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 4 π\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 0\n\nThe most appropriate answer is 4π.\n\n<<<B>>>"
