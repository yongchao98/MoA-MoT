    "In a universe where magnetic monopoles (isolated north or south poles) exist, two of Maxwell's equations would need to be modified to account for them.\n\nThe two equations that would change are:\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** In our universe, this law is expressed as `∇ ⋅ B = 0`, which mathematically states that magnetic monopoles do not exist. Magnetic field lines always form closed loops. If magnetic monopoles were to exist, they would act as sources or sinks of the magnetic field, much like electric charges do for the electric field. The equation would then be modified to `∇ ⋅ B = μ₀ρm`, where ρm represents the magnetic charge density. This equation relates to the **divergence of the magnetic field**.\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction:** This law, `∇ × E = -∂B/∂t`, describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (a field with curl). If magnetic monopoles exist and can move, they would constitute a \"magnetic current\" (Jm). To maintain the symmetry of Maxwell's equations, this magnetic current would have to induce a circulating electric field, just as an electric current induces a circulating magnetic field (Ampère's Law). Therefore, Faraday's Law would be modified to include a magnetic current term: `∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀Jm`. This equation relates to the **circulation (or curl) of the electric field**.\n\nBased on this, the correct option is the one that identifies changes to the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation of the electric field.\n\n<<<D>>>"
