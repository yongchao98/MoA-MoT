    "To determine how the number of stars per unit distance changes with distance, we first need to understand the relationships between the given quantities.\n\n1.  **Parallax and Distance:** Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r). This is a fundamental concept in astronomy used for measuring stellar distances.\n    *   `plx ∝ 1/r` or `r ∝ 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Given Variation:** The problem states that the number of stars (N) varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵. This is best interpreted as the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, which can be written as a derivative:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵` or `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n3.  **Objective:** We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of distance (dN/dr) varies with distance (r).\n\n4.  **Connecting the Variables:** To find dN/dr from dN/d(plx), we can use the chain rule from calculus:\n    *   `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Finding d(plx)/dr:** Since `plx = 1/r`, we can differentiate parallax with respect to distance:\n    *   `d(plx)/dr = -1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitution and Calculation:** Now we substitute the known relationships into the chain rule equation:\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (-1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Expressing in terms of r:** To get the final relationship in terms of distance (r), we replace `plx` with `1/r`:\n    *   `plx⁻⁵ = (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n\n    Substituting this back into the proportionality for dN/dr:\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²)`\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ -r³`\n\nThe negative sign simply indicates that as distance (r) increases, the corresponding parallax interval decreases. The magnitude of the relationship shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance varies as the cube of the distance.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r) as r³.\n\n<<<A>>>"
