    "Here is a breakdown of each statement's validity based on the research:\n\n**A) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\nThis statement is **correct**. Group VIa (or Group 6) contains chromium (Cr), which is the basis for highly selective catalysts that oligomerize ethylene. Specifically, chromium-based catalysts are used to trimerize ethylene into 1-hexene. The Chevron Phillips Chemical company uses a proprietary chromium-based catalyst system on an industrial scale to produce 1-hexene from ethylene with high purity (around 99 wt%). These catalyst systems require an activator, often an aluminum-based compound like methylaluminoxane (MAO) or other alkylaluminum reagents, to initiate the catalytic process.\n\n**B) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\nThis statement is **incorrect**. While the *components* of such a system exist industrially, the specific process described—a single reactor with a dual-catalyst system for in-situ comonomer generation and incorporation—is not yet a widespread, standard industrial process in the US. Chevron Phillips Chemical operates world-scale plants in Texas that produce 1-hexene as a separate product using a chromium catalyst. This 1-hexene is then sold and used as a comonomer in separate polymerization reactors. While dual-catalyst and tandem catalysis systems are areas of intense research and development for producing polymers with tailored properties, their large-scale industrial implementation for in-situ comonomer generation is not established in the way the statement implies.\n\n**C) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\nThis statement is **incorrect**. While noble metals (like palladium, platinum, ruthenium) are indeed expensive, they are generally not the catalysts of choice for the selective oligomerization of ethylene to linear alpha-olefins like 1-hexene or 1-octene. Research shows some activity for ethylene oligomerization using palladium complexes, but these often produce hyperbranched structures rather than the specific linear alpha-olefins needed for regular branches in LLDPE. The most efficient and industrially relevant catalysts for this specific transformation are based on more abundant and less expensive metals like chromium, nickel, and iron. Therefore, the primary issue is not just cost, but that noble metals are not the most effective catalysts for this particular reaction.\n\n**D) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\nThis statement is **incorrect**. The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization of ethylene to form alpha-olefins. Aluminum-based activators, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO), modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), and various trialkylaluminum compounds (e.g., triethylaluminum), are not only compatible but are frequently essential co-catalysts for activating the chromium-based oligomerization catalysts. Numerous studies demonstrate that chromium complexes require an aluminum-based activator to become highly active and selective for ethylene trimerization or tetramerization. The activator plays a crucial role in the alkylation of the chromium center, which initiates the catalytic cycle.\n\nBased on the analysis, statement A is the only correct one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
