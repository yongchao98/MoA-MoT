    "To determine the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same signal as the spotted star, we first need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the starspots.\n\n### 1. Calculate the Flux Variation from Starspots\n\nThe variation in the star's brightness is due to its rotation, which alternately reveals a completely unspotted hemisphere and a hemisphere partially covered by cooler, dark spots. The amplitude of this variation is the relative difference between the maximum and minimum observed flux.\n\nThe flux (F) from a surface is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (T), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (F ∝ T⁴).\n\n*   **Star's effective temperature (T_star):** 6000 K\n*   **Spot's effective temperature (T_spot):** 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   **Spot filling factor (f):** 20% or 0.20\n\n**Maximum Flux (F_max):**\nThis occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The observed flux is proportional to the flux from the normal stellar surface.\nF_max ∝ T_star⁴\n\n**Minimum Flux (F_min):**\nThis occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. The visible disk is a composite of the unspotted photosphere (80% of the area) and cooler spots (20% of the area).\nF_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴\n\n**Amplitude of the Signal:**\nThe relative amplitude of the light curve is the fractional drop in flux:\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\nAmplitude = [T_star⁴ - ((1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴)] / T_star⁴\nAmplitude = [T_star⁴ - T_star⁴ + f * T_star⁴ - f * T_spot⁴] / T_star⁴\nAmplitude = [f * (T_star⁴ - T_spot⁴)] / T_star⁴\nAmplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\nAmplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]\nAmplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\nAmplitude = 0.20 * [1 - 0.48225]\nAmplitude = 0.20 * 0.51775\n**Amplitude ≈ 0.10355**\n\n### 2. Equate to Exoplanet Transit Depth\n\nThe dimming of a star's light caused by a transiting exoplanet is known as the transit depth. For a planet that is much smaller than the star, this depth is approximately the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\nTransit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)\nTransit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\n**Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²**\n\n### 3. Solve for the Planet's Relative Radius\n\nTo find the exoplanet size that produces the same signal amplitude, we set the transit depth equal to the amplitude calculated from the starspots.\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10355\n**R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218**\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<B>>>"
