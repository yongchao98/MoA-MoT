    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the moles of Fe(OH)₃\n\nFirst, we calculate the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Atomic mass of Iron (Fe) ≈ 55.85 g/mol\n*   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n*   Atomic mass of Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1.01 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 moles.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the required volume of strong acid\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid (represented by H⁺) follows this neutralization reaction:\n\n**Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)**\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ ions for complete dissolution.\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed = 3 * 0.0009356 mol ≈ 0.002807 moles.\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid needed to provide this amount of H⁺.\n*   Volume (L) = Moles / Molarity\n*   Volume (L) = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L.\n\nTo convert this volume to cubic centimeters (cm³), we multiply by 1000.\n*   Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L = 28.07 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume is very close to the value of 28.05 cm³ provided in option D.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution\n\nAfter the reaction, the 0.0009356 moles of Fe(OH)₃ are converted into 0.0009356 moles of Fe³⁺ ions. The total volume of the solution is 100 cm³, which is 0.1 L.\n\nFirst, calculate the concentration of the Fe³⁺ ions.\n*   [Fe³⁺] = Moles / Volume (L)\n*   [Fe³⁺] = 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M.\n\nThe iron(III) ion (Fe³⁺) is a weak acid that hydrolyzes in water, producing H⁺ ions and thus lowering the pH. The hydrolysis reaction is:\n\n**Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)**\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction (Ka) for the hydrated iron(III) ion is approximately 6.5 x 10⁻³.\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the H⁺ concentration at equilibrium.\n*   Initial: [Fe³⁺] = 0.009356 M, [H⁺] ≈ 0\n*   Change: [Fe³⁺] = -x, [H⁺] = +x\n*   Equilibrium: [Fe³⁺] = 0.009356 - x, [H⁺] = x\n\nThe Ka expression is:\nKa = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺] / [Fe³⁺] = (x)(x) / (0.009356 - x)\n6.5 x 10⁻³ = x² / (0.009356 - x)\n\nThis can be rearranged into a quadratic equation:\nx² + (6.5 x 10⁻³)x - (6.08 x 10⁻⁵) = 0\n\nSolving for x (which represents [H⁺]) using the quadratic formula:\nx = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a\nx = [-0.0065 + √((0.0065)² - 4(1)(-6.08 x 10⁻⁵))] / 2\nx = [-0.0065 + √(4.225 x 10⁻⁵ + 2.432 x 10⁻⁴)] / 2\nx = [-0.0065 + √(2.8545 x 10⁻⁴)] / 2\nx = [-0.0065 + 0.01689] / 2\nx = 0.01039 / 2 = 0.005195 M\n\nSo, the concentration of H⁺ is 0.005195 M. Now, we can calculate the pH.\n*   pH = -log₁₀[H⁺]\n*   pH = -log₁₀(0.005195) ≈ 2.28\n\nThis pH value (2.28) is closest to the pH of 2.04 in option D. The minor difference can be attributed to variations in the published Ka value for the Fe³⁺ ion or slight rounding during intermediate steps. Based on both the calculated volume and the pH, option D is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
