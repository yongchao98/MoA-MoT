    "Pions, phonons, and magnons are all examples of Nambu-Goldstone bosons, which are massless or nearly massless particles that arise when a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken.\n\n*   **A) Pion:** Pions are the pseudo-Goldstone bosons that result from the spontaneous breaking of the approximate chiral symmetry of the strong interaction (QCD).\n*   **B) Phonon:** Phonons are the Goldstone bosons that arise from the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice.\n*   **D) Magnon:** Magnons (quantized spin waves) are the Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry in a ferromagnet.\n\n*   **C) Skyrmion:** A skyrmion is not a Goldstone boson. It is a topological soliton, which is a stable, particle-like excitation within a field. While skyrmions can arise in theories that also exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking (for example, in the effective field theory of pions, which are themselves Goldstone bosons), the skyrmion itself is a topologically protected structure, not the direct particle manifestation of a broken symmetry according to Goldstone's theorem.\n\nTherefore, the skyrmion is the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the way that a Goldstone boson is.\n\n<<<C>>>"
