    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can follow a step-by-step calculation based on the principles of planetary science.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its host star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula for the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a))\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 (T_eq1) and Planet2 (T_eq2), we can set up the following equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a₂))]\n\nAccording to the problem description, both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are constant. It is also stated that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\nThe next step is to determine the semi-major axes. The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and its semi-major axis (a) by the formula:\n\nK ≈ M_p * √(G / (M_star * a))\n\nHere, G is the gravitational constant and M_star is the mass of the star. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis 'a':\n\na ≈ G * M_p² / (M_star * K²)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = [G * M_p2² / (M_star * K₂²)] / [G * M_p1² / (M_star * K₁²)]\n\nThe terms G and M_star cancel out, leaving:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ), as K = c * (Δλ / λ), where c is the speed of light and λ is the rest wavelength. Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Mass of Planet1 (M_p1) = 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet2 (M_p2) = 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1 (Δλ₁) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2 (Δλ₂) = 0.04 Å\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratios:\n*   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   K₁ / K₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNext, we substitute these ratios into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √(225 / 784) = 15 / 28\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>"
