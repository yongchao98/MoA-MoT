    "To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we must apply the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as E = π²ħ² / 2mL². Therefore, the single-particle energy levels are:\nE_n = n²E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nSince the particles are spin-1/2, they are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level (n) and the spin (up or down). Consequently, each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation for the total energy of the system in its lowest energy states:\n\n**1. Ground State Energy (Lowest Total Energy)**\nTo achieve the ground state, the particles must fill the lowest available energy levels.\n*   **Level n=1:** Can hold two particles. Their combined energy is 2 * E₁ = 2 * (1²E) = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2:** Can hold the remaining two particles. Their combined energy is 2 * E₂ = 2 * (2²E) = 2 * 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of these energies:\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n**2. First Excited State Energy**\nTo find the energy of the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n*   **Level n=1:** Still holds two particles. Energy = 2 * E₁ = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2:** Now holds one particle. Energy = 1 * E₂ = 1 * (2²E) = 4E.\n*   **Level n=3:** Now holds one particle. Energy = 1 * E₃ = 1 * (3²E) = 9E.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n**3. Second Excited State Energy**\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy above the first excited state. We must consider the different ways to excite the system from the ground state.\n*   **Option A:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3 (First excited state, Energy = 15E).\n*   **Option B:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration would be one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n*   **Option C:** Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration would be two particles in n=1 and two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₃) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E), the second lowest energy after the ground state is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energies are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
