    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we first need to calculate its mole fraction among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nThe formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes is governed by the following equilibria and their overall stability constants (β):\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺ ; β₁ = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ; β₂ = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ; β₃ = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nThe mole fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nThis can be expressed in terms of the stability constants and the ligand (thiocyanate) concentration, [SCN⁻]:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nGiven the concentrations c(Co) = 10⁻² M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, we can proceed with the calculation. Since the thiocyanate concentration is ten times higher than the total cobalt concentration, we can assume the free thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium is approximately 0.1 M.\n\nFirst, let's calculate each term in the denominator of the mole fraction equation:\n*   1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, we sum these values to find the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the dithiocyanato complex:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the mole fraction (α₂) of [Co(SCN)₂]:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex in the solution is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
