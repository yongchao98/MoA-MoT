    "Here is a detailed analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of the two reactions and the resulting HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer ((S)-configuration at C5), the hydride can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces. This non-selective attack results in the formation of two products with either an (R) or (S) configuration at the newly formed C3 alcohol center.\n*   **Products:** The two products are (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers because they have one stereocenter that is the same (C5) and one that is different (C3).\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a reducing agent that converts ketones to alcohols. Since it is in excess, it will reduce both ketone groups.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. This leads to the formation of three possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:**\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other and are therefore a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore an achiral meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### **HPLC Analysis**\n\n**1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Diastereomers:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral chromatography.\n*   **Enantiomers:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n\nApplying this to the product mixture:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute as **one peak**.\n*   The meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated as a distinct **one peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇ alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅ diols) and will have different retention times.\n\nTherefore, the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will show a total of **4 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers.\n*   Chiral HPLC can separate both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n\nApplying this to the product mixture:\n*   All five unique stereoisomers in the mixture will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n*   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2)\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n*   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5)\n\nTherefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will resolve all five compounds, resulting in **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC and 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>"
