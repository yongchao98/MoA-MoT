    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n### 1. Position-Momentum Uncertainty\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a particle's position (Δx) and the uncertainty in its momentum (Δp) must be greater than or equal to a constant value. For minimum uncertainty, the relation is:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   **Δx** is the uncertainty in position = 0.1 nm = 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   **Δp** is the uncertainty in momentum\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nFirst, we calculate the minimum uncertainty in the electron's momentum (Δp):\n\nΔp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\nΔp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n### 2. Energy-Momentum Relation\n\nThe uncertainty in energy (ΔE) can be related to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) through the particle's velocity (v). The relationship is given by:\n\nΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\nThis relationship holds for both non-relativistic and relativistic cases.\n\n### 3. Calculation of Uncertainty in Energy\n\nNow, we can calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy using the given velocity and the calculated uncertainty in momentum:\n\n*   **v** = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   **Δp** ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\nΔE ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\nΔE ≈ 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\nΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThis value is approximately 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<D>>>"
