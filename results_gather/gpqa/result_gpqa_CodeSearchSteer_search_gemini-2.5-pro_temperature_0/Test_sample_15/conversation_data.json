    "A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral and not a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This often occurs when a carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, creating a chiral center. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This planarity makes the molecule superimposable on its mirror image, so it is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors *(3aR,7aS)*, which indicate specific configurations at chiral centers. A compound that is a single, specific enantiomer is by definition chiral and optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at carbon 2 and carbon 3). However, the substituents on both chiral centers are identical (H, CH₃, COOH). The *(2R,3S)* configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. Such compounds are called meso compounds, which are achiral despite having chiral centers and are therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound. The *(2R,3R)* configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its non-superimposable mirror image is the *(2S,3S)* isomer. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a `-CH₂-CH=CH-` path around the ring, and a `-CH=CH-CH₂-` path. This makes C1 a chiral center. The name specifies the *(R)* enantiomer, which is a single, chiral molecule and thus optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound has a highly symmetrical structure. The *cis*-isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring, possesses a plane of symmetry. The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure of this ketone is Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
