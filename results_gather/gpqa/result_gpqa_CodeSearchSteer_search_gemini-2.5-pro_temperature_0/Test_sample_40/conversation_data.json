    "This problem requires the application of Einstein's relativistic velocity-addition formula. Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference.**\n    *   The laboratory is the stationary frame of reference (let's call it S).\n    *   The moving glass block is the moving frame of reference (let's call it S').\n\n2.  **Determine the velocities.**\n    *   The velocity of the moving frame (the glass block) relative to the stationary frame (the lab) is `v`.\n    *   We need to find the speed of light inside the glass, as measured from within the glass's own frame of reference (S'). The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). So, `n = c / u'`. The problem states to take `c = 1`. Therefore, the speed of light in the rest frame of the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity-addition formula.**\n    The formula for adding velocities in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c^2)`\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the stationary frame (the lab).\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object in the moving frame (the glass).\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame relative to the stationary frame.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula.**\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression.**\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n\n    `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\nThis result corresponds to the famous Fizeau experiment, which measured the speed of light in moving water and provided early evidence supporting the theory of special relativity.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\nC) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\nD) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\nThe calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
