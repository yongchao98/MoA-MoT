    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to compare the transit probabilities of Planet_1 and Planet_2 to determine which is more likely to be observed transiting its host star and by what factor.\n\n2.  **Recall the Transit Probability Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the geometric probability of it transiting its host star is the ratio of the star's radius (R_s) to the planet's semi-major axis (a).\n    *   `P_transit = R_s / a`\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio for the Two Planets:** We need to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 (P_transit1) to that of Planet_2 (P_transit2).\n    *   `P_transit1 = R_s1 / a1`\n    *   `P_transit2 = R_s2 / a2`\n    *   Ratio = `P_transit1 / P_transit2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2)`\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Given Information:**\n    *   The host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`.\n    *   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P1 = P2 / 3`.\n    *   The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2's host star: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n\n5.  **Simplify the Ratio:** Since the stellar radii are equal (`R_s1 = R_s2`), they cancel out in the ratio, which simplifies to:\n    *   Ratio = `a2 / a1`\n\n6.  **Relate the Semi-Major Axis to Known Quantities:** To find the ratio of the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion. The law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) and inversely proportional to the mass of the host star (M_s).\n    *   `P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_s`\n\n7.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** Rearranging Kepler's Third Law to solve for 'a' gives:\n    *   `a^3 ∝ P^2 * M_s`\n    *   `a ∝ (P^2 * M_s)^(1/3)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):** Now, we can substitute the expressions for `a1` and `a2` into our simplified probability ratio.\n    *   `a2 / a1 = [ (P2^2 * M_s2) / (P1^2 * M_s1) ]^(1/3)`\n\n9.  **Substitute the Given Relationships:** Replace `P1` and `M_s1` with their equivalents in terms of `P2` and `M_s2`.\n    *   `a2 / a1 = [ (P2^2 * M_s2) / ( (P2 / 3)^2 * (2 * M_s2) ) ]^(1/3)`\n\n10. **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *   `a2 / a1 = [ (P2^2 * M_s2) / ( (P2^2 / 9) * 2 * M_s2 ) ]^(1/3)`\n    *   The `P2^2` and `M_s2` terms cancel out.\n    *   `a2 / a1 = [ 1 / (2 / 9) ]^(1/3)`\n    *   `a2 / a1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n    *   `a2 / a1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n11. **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   `a2 / a1 ≈ 1.65096`\n\n12. **Conclusion:** The ratio of the transit probabilities `P_transit1 / P_transit2` is equal to `a2 / a1`, which is approximately 1.65. This means Planet_1 has a transit probability that is about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
