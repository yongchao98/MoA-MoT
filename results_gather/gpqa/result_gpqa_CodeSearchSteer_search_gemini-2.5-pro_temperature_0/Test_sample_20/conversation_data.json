    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is a type of isomerism where a molecule exists in two or more interconvertible forms that differ in the position of a proton and a double bond. Keto-enol tautomerism is a common type, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** The structure of 1,4-benzoquinone consists of a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone (C=O) groups at opposite ends. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Since benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbon atoms between the carbonyl groups are CH₂ groups, meaning they have alpha-hydrogens. These alpha-hydrogens can move, allowing the compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is particularly stable due to the formation of an aromatic ring.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center – a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since this carbon is a chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and will exhibit optical isomerism (it has D and L enantiomers).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of an alkene with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C=C double bond. Due to this symmetry, it is achiral and does not have a non-superimposable mirror image. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
