    "Here's a breakdown of the options to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This describes Earth itself, which has a density of approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as about 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** Due to its greater mass, this planet would experience stronger gravitational compression. Gravity acting on an object's mass compresses it, leading to a reduction in size and an increase in density. Therefore, a rocky planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times the mass would be significantly denser than Earth.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** With less mass, this planet would undergo less gravitational compression compared to Earth. As a result, its density would be lower than Earth's. This is consistent with observations in our own solar system, where Earth is denser than Mars, which is less massive.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, the planet in option (c) would have the highest density. The immense gravitational force of a planet five times the mass of Earth would compress its materials far more than the other planets described, resulting in a higher overall density. Studies on the mass-radius relationship of rocky exoplanets confirm that for planets with similar compositions, density tends to increase with mass due to this gravitational compression.\n\n<<<B>>>"
