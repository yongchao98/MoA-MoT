    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the correct transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Transitions and Selection Rules\n\nThe problem describes a cascade decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through an intermediate state via two electric dipole transitions. The selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial state:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $l=0$ and $m=0$.\n*   **Selection rule for $l$:** Since the initial $l=0$, we must have $\\Delta l = +1$, which means the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Selection rule for $m$:** Since the initial $m=0$, we can have $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$. This means the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   **Intermediate state:** The problem implies the intermediate state has a principal quantum number $n'=2$. Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\nLet's check if the transitions from the possible intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ are allowed.\n*   **Initial state:** $|n',l',m'\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$. Here, $l'=1$.\n*   **Final state:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Here, the final angular momentum quantum number is $l_{final}=0$.\n*   **Selection rule for $l$:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n*   **Selection rule for $m$:** The change $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$ must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate states ($m' = 0, \\pm 1$).\n\nAll three routes, via $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, are permitted by the selection rules.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe overall probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n**Probability of the First Step: $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$**\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (the 3s orbital) is spherically symmetric. This means there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the first photon. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate sub-levels of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state. The total probability of transitioning from the 3s state to the 2p manifold is 1 (as it's the only significant decay channel). Therefore, the probability of populating each specific intermediate state is:\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n**Probability of the Second Step: $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$**\n\nOnce the atom is in one of the intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (the 2p orbital), it will decay to a lower energy level. According to the dipole selection rules, a transition from $l=1$ can only go to $l=0$ or $l=2$. Since the only available lower energy level is $n=1$, which has $l=0$, the only possible decay channel is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s orbital). Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1, regardless of the value of $m'$.\n$P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$ for $m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n**Total Probability of the Cascade Route**\n\nThe total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n$P(\\text{route via } m') = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n\n*   For the route via $|2,1,1\\rangle$: Probability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n*   For the route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$: Probability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n*   For the route via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: Probability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### 3. Compare with the Options\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on our findings:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The transition route is valid, and the calculated probability is correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
