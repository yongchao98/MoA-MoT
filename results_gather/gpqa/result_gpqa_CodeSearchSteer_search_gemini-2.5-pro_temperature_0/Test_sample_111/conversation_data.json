    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Normalize the State Vector |alpha>\n\nThe given state is proportional to `(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. Let's call the unnormalized state `|alpha'>`.\n\n`|alpha'> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`\n\nTo normalize this state, we need to find its norm and divide the state by it. The squared norm is given by `<alpha'|alpha'>`.\n\n`<alpha'|alpha'> = |(1+i)|^2 + |(2-i)|^2`\n`<alpha'|alpha'> = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = (1+1) + (4+1) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant is the reciprocal of the square root of this value, which is `1/sqrt(7)`.\n\nThe normalized state `|alpha>` is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nIn matrix notation, using the basis `|up> = [1, 0]` and `|down> = [0, 1]`, the state vector is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n\n### 2. Find the Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of the Operator A\n\nThe operator A is given by the matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` for `i != j` and `0` otherwise. In the `{|up>, |down>}` basis, this corresponds to the matrix:\n\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`.\n\n`det([[ -λ, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -λ ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = λ^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\n\nThis gives two eigenvalues:\n*   `λ_1 = +hbar/2`\n*   `λ_2 = -hbar/2`\n\nNow, we find the corresponding eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.\n\n**For λ_1 = +hbar/2:**\n`(A - λ_1*I)v_1 = 0`\n`[[ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]] * [[x], [y]] = 0`\nThis leads to the equation `- (hbar/2)x + (hbar/2)y = 0`, which simplifies to `x = y`.\nThe unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 1]`. Normalizing it gives the eigenvector `|+>`:\n`|+> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [[1], [1]] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`\n\n**For λ_2 = -hbar/2:**\n`(A - λ_2*I)v_2 = 0`\n`[[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]] * [[x], [y]] = 0`\nThis leads to the equation `(hbar/2)x + (hbar/2)y = 0`, which simplifies to `x = -y`.\nThe unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, -1]`. Normalizing it gives the eigenvector `|->`:\n`|-> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [[1], [-1]] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Measurement Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the corresponding eigenstate with the state `|alpha>`.\n\n**Probability of measuring λ_1 = +hbar/2 (P_+)**:\n`P_+ = |<+|alpha>|^2`\n`<+|alpha> = ( (1/sqrt(2)) * [<up| + <down|] ) * ( (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>] )`\n`<+|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1)*(1+i) + (1)*(2-i) ]`\n`<+|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/sqrt(14)`\n`P_+ = |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n**Probability of measuring λ_2 = -hbar/2 (P_-)**:\n`P_- = |<-|alpha>|^2`\n`<-|alpha> = ( (1/sqrt(2)) * [<up| - <down|] ) * ( (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>] )`\n`<-|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1)*(1+i) - (1)*(2-i) ]`\n`<-|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)`\n`P_- = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)^2 + 2^2) / 14 = (1 + 4) / 14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Average (Expectation) Value of the Operator A\n\nThe expectation value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways.\n\n**Method 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities**\n`<A> = P_+ * λ_1 + P_- * λ_2`\n`<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n`<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7`\n\n**Method 2: Using the formula `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`**\nFirst, calculate `A|alpha>`:\n`A|alpha> = ( (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] ) * ( (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]] )`\n`A|alpha> = (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n\nNow, calculate `<alpha|A|alpha>`:\n`<alpha|A|alpha> = ( (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] ) * ( (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [[2-i], [1+i]] )`\n`<alpha|A|alpha> = (hbar/14) * [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]`\n`<alpha|A|alpha> = (hbar/14) * [ (2 - 2i - i + i^2) + (2 + 2i + i + i^2) ]`\n`<alpha|A|alpha> = (hbar/14) * [ (2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1) ]`\n`<alpha|A|alpha> = (hbar/14) * [ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) ]`\n`<alpha|A|alpha> = (hbar/14) * 2 = hbar/7`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator A is `hbar/7`. This matches the values provided in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
