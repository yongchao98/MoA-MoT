    "An N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circle of radius 'a' as the number of sides N becomes infinitely large. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. The intensity distribution in this pattern is described by a Bessel function. The angular positions of the intensity minima (the dark rings) are given by the condition:\n\nsin(θ) = m * λ / d\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the minimum, λ is the wavelength of the light, d is the diameter of the aperture, and m is a coefficient determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function J₁(x). The diameter d is twice the radius a, so d = 2a.\n\nThe condition for the minima is more precisely given by:\nk * a * sin(θ) = xₙ\n\nwhere:\n*   k is the wave number, k = 2π / λ.\n*   a is the radius of the aperture.\n*   xₙ are the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nUsing the small angle approximation, sin(θ) ≈ θ, the equation becomes:\n(2π / λ) * a * θₙ = xₙ\nθₙ = (xₙ * λ) / (2π * a)\n\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the first two zeros of J₁(x).\n*   The first zero, x₁, is approximately 3.8317.\n*   The second zero, x₂, is approximately 7.0156.\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first two minima:\n*   **First minimum (θ₁):**\n    θ₁ = (x₁ * λ) / (2π * a) = (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 λ / a.\n\n*   **Second minimum (θ₂):**\n    θ₂ = (x₂ * λ) / (2π * a) = (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 λ / a.\n\nThe angular distance between these two minima is Δθ:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ = (1.1166 λ / a) - (0.6098 λ / a)\nΔθ = 0.5068 λ / a\n\nThis value is very close to the option B.\n\nΔθ = [(x₂ - x₁) * λ] / (2π * a) = [(7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ] / (2π * a) = (3.1839 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.5067 λ / a.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 0.506 λ / a\nC) 1.220 λ / a\nD) 0.610 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value of 0.5067 λ / a matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
