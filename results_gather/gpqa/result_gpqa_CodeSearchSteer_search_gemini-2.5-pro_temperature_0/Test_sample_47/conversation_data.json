    "The synthesis described proceeds through the following steps:\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂) forms 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1).** This is a standard alpha-halogenation of a ketone.\n2.  **2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), forming a ring-contracted product (Product 2).** This reaction is a Favorskii rearrangement. In cyclic α-halo ketones, this rearrangement leads to a contraction of the ring. Thus, the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n3.  **Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine, forming cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3).** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride.\n4.  **Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H), forming cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde (Product 4).** This reagent is a mild reducing agent known for the selective reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes.\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nCyclopentanecarboxaldehyde has a plane of symmetry that includes the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the rest of the five-membered ring. Due to this symmetry:\n\n*   The **aldehyde proton** is unique. (1)\n*   The **proton on C1** (the carbon attached to the aldehyde) is unique. (1)\n*   The two protons on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other. However, the two protons on C2 itself are diastereotopic (not equivalent). This gives **two distinct signals** for the C2/C5 positions.\n*   Similarly, the two protons on the next set of carbons (C3 and C4) are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. This results in another **two distinct signals** for the C3/C4 positions.\n\nCounting these up: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2/C5-H's) + 2 (C3/C4-H's) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
