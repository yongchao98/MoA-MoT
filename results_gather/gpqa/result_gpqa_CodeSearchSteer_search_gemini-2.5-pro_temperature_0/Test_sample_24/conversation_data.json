    "Based on the analysis of the two reactions, the correct reactants can be identified.\n\n**Reaction 1: A + H2SO4 ---> 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one**\n\nThis reaction is an acid-catalyzed rearrangement of a 1,2-diol, known as a Pinacol rearrangement, which produces a ketone. The starting material must be a vicinal diol (1,2-diol). The product is a spiro ketone, which is often formed from the rearrangement of a fused cyclic diol, such as a decalindiol.\n*   **Reactant A = 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol:** This is a vicinal diol on a decalin (octahydronaphthalene) framework. Treatment with a strong acid like H2SO4 would cause protonation of one hydroxyl group, loss of water to form a carbocation, and a subsequent 1,2-alkyl shift to form the stable spiro ketone product. This is a classic Pinacol rearrangement pathway.\n*   **Reactant A = 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol:** This is a secondary alcohol. Treating it with H2SO4 would primarily lead to dehydration to form an alkene, not oxidation to a ketone.\n\nTherefore, reactant A is **2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol**.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BuLi + H+ ---> 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol**\n\nThis reaction involves the treatment of a substrate with a strong base (butyllithium, BuLi), followed by protonation, to yield a rearranged alcohol. This is characteristic of a Wittig rearrangement. The starting material for a Wittig rearrangement is an ether.\n*   **Reactant B = (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene:** This is benzyl prenyl ether. Treatment with BuLi deprotonates the acidic benzylic carbon. The resulting carbanion can then undergo a rearrangement. The product, 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol, is formed via a-Wittig rearrangement, where the prenyl group migrates from the oxygen to the adjacent benzylic carbon. This type of rearrangement from an ether to an alcohol is well-documented.\n*   **Reactant B = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one:** This is a ketone. Reaction with BuLi, a strong nucleophile, would result in the addition of a butyl group to the carbonyl carbon, yielding a tertiary alcohol after protonation. This would not produce the specified product.\n\nTherefore, reactant B is **(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene**.\n\nCombining these findings, reactant A is 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol and reactant B is (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
