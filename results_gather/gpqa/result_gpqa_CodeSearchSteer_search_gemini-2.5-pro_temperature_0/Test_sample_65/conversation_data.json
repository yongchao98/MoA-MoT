    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian, which are composed of Standard Model fields. The construction of these operators must adhere to certain fundamental symmetries.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry and (2) Poincare Symmetry:** SMEFT is a quantum field theory designed to be consistent with the principles of special relativity. Therefore, all operators must be invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and, more generally, Poincare transformations (which also include spacetime translations). A consistent, unitary quantum field theory that is manifestly Lorentz invariant is a foundational assumption of SMEFT.\n\n2.  **CP Symmetry:** CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model itself. SMEFT, as an extension of the SM, not only incorporates this violation but also introduces new potential sources of CP violation through higher-dimensional operators. There is extensive research dedicated to classifying and studying these CP-violating operators in SMEFT. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all SMEFT operators.\n\n3.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory which states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P), and time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nBased on this, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
