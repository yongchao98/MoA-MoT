    "The reaction of a ketone with sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a known method for synthesizing α-diketones (also called 1,2-diketones). The process involves the nitrosation of the ketone at the α-carbon (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group), followed by hydrolysis.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the two reactions:\n\n**Reaction A: Synthesis of 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione**\n\nThe starting material A is converted to 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. For this transformation to occur, the starting material must be a ketone with the same carbon skeleton. The appropriate precursor is 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one. The reaction introduces a second carbonyl group at the α-position (C2 or C6) of the cyclohexanone ring. The other option for A, 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, is an ether-alcohol and would not yield the desired diketone under these conditions.\n\n**Reaction B: Synthesis of 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione**\n\nThe starting material B yields 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. This product is an α-diketone with carbonyl groups at positions 2 and 3. The logical starting material is a ketone that can be oxidized at the adjacent carbon. 5-methylhexan-2-one is a suitable precursor. In the presence of NaNO2 and HCl, the methylene group at the C3 position (the α-carbon) is converted into a carbonyl group. For unsymmetrical ketones, the nitrosation reaction typically occurs at the more-substituted α-carbon. In the case of 5-methylhexan-2-one, the C3 position is more substituted than the C1 position, leading to the formation of the 2,3-dione. The other option for B, 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol, is a diol, and its oxidation to a diketone would require different reagents.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct starting materials are 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one for A and 5-methylhexan-2-one for B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
