    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the energy of the Lithium nucleus.\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleus (X)**\n    *   The problem specifies the nucleus X as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n    *   Lithium has an atomic number (Z) of 3, which means it has 3 protons.\n    *   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\n2.  **Determine the Rest Mass and Rest Energy (E₀)**\n    *   To find the total energy, we first need the rest energy of the ⁶Li nucleus. The rest energy is given by Einstein's equation, E₀ = m₀c², where m₀ is the rest mass of the nucleus.\n    *   The atomic mass of a ⁶Li atom is 6.015122887 atomic mass units (u). This includes the mass of 3 electrons.\n    *   The mass of an electron is approximately 0.00054858 u. The total mass of the 3 electrons is 3 * 0.00054858 u = 0.00164574 u.\n    *   To get the nuclear mass (m₀), we subtract the electron mass from the atomic mass:\n        m₀ = 6.015122887 u - 0.00164574 u = 6.013477147 u.\n    *   Next, we convert the nuclear mass from atomic mass units (u) to Giga-electron-volts (GeV). The conversion factor is 1 u ≈ 0.9314941 GeV/c².\n    *   Rest Energy (E₀) = 6.013477147 u * 0.9314941 GeV/u = 5.6015 GeV.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n    *   The nucleus is traveling at a speed (v) of 0.96c, where c is the speed of light.\n    *   The Lorentz factor (γ) is calculated using the formula: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n    *   γ = 1 / √0.0784 = 1 / 0.28\n    *   γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Energy (E)**\n    *   The total energy (E) of the moving nucleus is the product of its Lorentz factor and its rest energy: E = γ * E₀.\n    *   E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.6015 GeV\n    *   E ≈ 20.005 GeV\n\nAn alternative common approximation in nuclear physics is to estimate the rest energy by multiplying the mass number (A) by the rest energy of a proton.\n*   Rest energy of a proton ≈ 0.938272 GeV.\n*   Approximate Rest Energy (E₀) ≈ 6 * 0.938272 GeV = 5.6296 GeV.\n*   Total Energy (E) ≈ 3.5714 * 5.6296 GeV ≈ 20.099 GeV.\n\nBoth calculations yield a result very close to 20.1 GeV. Comparing this with the given options, 20.132 GeV is the most plausible answer. The minor difference can be attributed to the specific values of physical constants used or the approximation method intended for the problem.\n\nA) 18.475 GeV\nB) 21.419 GeV\nC) 23.069 GeV\nD) 20.132 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 20.1 GeV is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
