    "To clearly distinguish between two energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the uncertainty in the energy of each level. This is a direct consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the lifetime of the state (Δt) is approximately equal to the reduced Planck constant (ħ). The formula is:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≈ ħ\n\nA quantum state with a finite lifetime has an inherent uncertainty in its energy, often referred to as the natural linewidth. To resolve two such states, the energy separation between them must be larger than this linewidth.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each state using their given lifetimes. The value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n**State 1:**\n*   Lifetime (Δt₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) ≈ ħ / Δt₁\n*   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n*   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**State 2:**\n*   Lifetime (Δt₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂) ≈ ħ / Δt₂\n*   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n*   ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has a larger energy uncertainty (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV). For the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, their energy difference must be significantly larger than the broader of the two energy uncertainties. Therefore, the energy difference must be greater than approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nThe only option that provides a sufficient energy difference to clearly distinguish the two levels is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
