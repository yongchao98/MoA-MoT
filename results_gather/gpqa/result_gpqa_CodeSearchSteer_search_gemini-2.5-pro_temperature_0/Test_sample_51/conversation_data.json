    "The search results confirm the formulas and constants used in the preliminary analysis.\n\n*   **Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the population of two energy levels, N₂ and N₁, is given by (N₂/N₁) = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁)/(k * T)). The search results use slightly different notations (e.g., ϖ for statistical weight), but the core formula is identical.\n*   **Energy from Wavelength:** The energy (E) of a photon is related to its wavelength (λ) by the formula E = hc/λ.\n*   **Constants:**\n    *   Boltzmann constant (k) is approximately 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K.\n    *   The product hc (Planck's constant times the speed of light) is conveniently expressed as approximately 1.24 x 10⁻⁶ eV·m or 1240 eV·nm.\n\nThe initial reasoning holds. The problem requires a two-step calculation:\n1.  Determine the energy difference (ΔE) between the two levels using the provided wavelength.\n2.  Use the Boltzmann equation to find the ratio of the population ratios at the two different temperatures.\n\nThe information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of its surface covered by spots is extraneous, as the effective temperatures for both scenarios (with and without spots) are given directly.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the energy difference (ΔE)**\n\nThe transition wavelength is λ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm = 1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m.\nUsing the formula ΔE = hc/λ:\nΔE = (1.24 x 10⁻⁶ eV·m) / (1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m) ≈ 8.56 eV\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the factor of change in the population ratio**\n\nThe ratio of populations is R = N₂/N₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T)).\nThe question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes, which is the ratio of the ratios: Factor = R_nospots / R_spots.\n\nFactor = [exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))] / [exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))]\nFactor = exp[(-ΔE/k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots)]\n\nGiven:\n*   T_nospots = 6000 K\n*   T_spots = 5500 K\n*   ΔE ≈ 8.56 eV\n*   k ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n\nFirst, calculate the exponent term (-ΔE/k):\n-ΔE/k ≈ -8.56 / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ -99338 K\n\nNext, calculate the temperature term (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots):\n1/6000 - 1/5500 = (5500 - 6000) / (6000 * 5500) = -500 / 33,000,000 ≈ -1.515 x 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹\n\nNow, calculate the full exponent:\nExponent ≈ (-99338 K) * (-1.515 x 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹) ≈ 1.505\n\nFinally, calculate the factor:\nFactor = exp(1.505) ≈ 4.50\n\nThis value is very close to 4.5.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n- When spots are present, the temperature is lower (5500 K vs 6000 K).\n- According to the Boltzmann distribution, at a lower temperature, a smaller fraction of atoms will be in the higher energy state.\n- Therefore, the ratio N₂/N₁ should be smaller for the spotted star.\n- The question asks for the factor R_nospots / R_spots. Since R_nospots will be larger than R_spots, the factor must be greater than 1. The calculation yields ~4.5, which is consistent with this logic.\n\nThe calculation is robust.\n\nFinal Answer is C.\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the relative populations of atomic energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (N₂) to the number of atoms in a lower energy level (N₁) is given by:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   g₁ and g₂ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   E₂ - E₁ (or ΔE) is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe problem asks for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots. Let's denote the ratio without spots as R_nospots and with spots as R_spots.\n\nFactor = R_nospots / R_spots\n\nR_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))\nR_spots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n\nThe factor is the ratio of these two expressions:\n\nFactor = [exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))] / [exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))]\nFactor = exp[(-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots)]\n\nFirst, we must calculate the energy difference (ΔE) from the given wavelength (λ = 1448 Å). The relationship between energy and wavelength is E = hc/λ.\n\n*   λ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm\n*   hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm (a useful constant for such calculations)\n\nΔE = 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.5635 eV\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the factor equation:\n\n*   ΔE ≈ 8.5635 eV\n*   k ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n*   T_nospots = 6000 K\n*   T_spots = 5500 K\n\nLet's calculate the exponent:\n\nExponent = (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots)\nExponent ≈ [-8.5635 / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵)] * (1/6000 - 1/5500)\nExponent ≈ [-99379] * [(5500 - 6000) / (6000 * 5500)]\nExponent ≈ [-99379] * [-500 / 33,000,000]\nExponent ≈ [-99379] * [-1.51515 x 10⁻⁵]\nExponent ≈ 1.5057\n\nFinally, we calculate the factor:\n\nFactor = exp(1.5057) ≈ 4.507\n\nThis value is approximately 4.5.\n\n<<<C>>>"
