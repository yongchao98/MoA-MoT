    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 3 and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with an excess of potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is a known transformation of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes. The strong base and high temperature promote a rearrangement reaction. While the provided spectroscopic data for Product 1 (¹H NMR: 4.79(2H), IR: 1720 cm⁻¹) is inconsistent with the expected initial product, the established chemical pathway under these conditions leads to the formation of **protoadamantan-4-one**. The IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a ketone, which supports the formation of a ketone like protoadamantan-4-one. We will proceed assuming Product 1 is protoadamantan-4-one, as this is the chemically sound product, and the provided NMR data may be erroneous or intended to mislead.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces a ketone to an alcohol. Thus, protoadamantan-4-one is reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol. However, the problem states the mixture is \"heated,\" and the subsequent reaction is an ozonolysis, which requires a carbon-carbon double bond. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, and heating an alcohol in the presence of a Lewis acid can cause dehydration. The dehydration of protoadamantan-4-ol is known to yield **protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). Therefore, Product 2 is protoadamantene, which contains the necessary C=C bond for the next step.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamantene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. Ozonolysis cleaves the C=C double bond and replaces it with carbonyl groups. The ozonolysis of protoadamantene is a known reaction that cleaves the double bond in the six-membered ring, leading to a ring-opening. The product formed is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**.\n\n**Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione. This molecule is highly symmetrical (C₂ᵥ symmetry) and exists predominantly in a dual chair conformation.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** We need to identify the most deshielded hydrogen atom. The possible protons are those on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C5), those on the carbons alpha to the ketones (C2, C4, C6, C8), and the methylene bridge proton (C9). Due to the electronic effects of the two carbonyl groups, the bridgehead protons (H1 and H5) are the most deshielded.\n*   **Coupling Pattern:** Let's analyze the coupling of the bridgehead proton, H1.\n    *   H1 is adjacent to three carbons: C2, C8, and C9.\n    *   It will couple to the protons on these carbons.\n    *   Due to the C₂ᵥ symmetry of the molecule, the environment around C2 is identical to that around C8.\n    *   H1 couples to the two axial protons on C2 and C8 (H2ax, H8ax). These two protons are equivalent by symmetry, and will split the H1 signal into a **triplet** (with coupling constant Jₐₓ).\n    *   H1 also couples to the two equatorial protons on C2 and C8 (H2eq, H8eq). These two protons are also equivalent to each other and will split the H1 signal into another **triplet** (with coupling constant Jₑᑫ).\n    *   The coupling constants for axial-axial (Jₐₓ) and axial-equatorial (Jₑᑫ) interactions are typically different.\n    *   Coupling to the protons on C9 is often weaker or can be ignored as a simplification in such problems.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for the most deshielded proton (H1) is split into a triplet by the two equivalent axial protons, and each of these lines is further split into a triplet by the two equivalent equatorial protons.\n\nThe resulting coupling pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
