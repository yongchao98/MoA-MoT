    "When 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, it undergoes a-sigmatropic rearrangement known as the Cope rearrangement. This type of reaction is common for 1,5-dienes and involves a concerted, cyclic transition state.\n\nThe starting material is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Its structure is:\n`CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-CH(C₄H₉)-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃`\n\nThe Cope rearrangement involves the six-carbon chain that includes the two double bonds (the 1,5-diene system), which are carbons 2 through 7. In this process, the sigma bond between carbons 4 and 5 breaks, a new sigma bond forms between carbons 2 and 7, and the double bonds shift.\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\n1.  The 1,5-diene system `C(2)=C(3)-C(4)-C(5)-C(6)=C(7)` enters a chair-like transition state.\n2.  The C4-C5 single bond breaks.\n3.  A new C2-C7 single bond forms.\n4.  The π-bonds migrate to form new double bonds between C3-C4 and C5-C6.\n\nThe resulting molecule has a new carbon skeleton. To determine its IUPAC name, we must identify the longest carbon chain that contains both new double bonds. The structure of the product is:\n`CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH=C(C₄H₉)`\n\nThe longest carbon chain in this molecule contains ten carbon atoms (a deca- chain), starting from the `CH₂=` group and extending into the butyl group. Numbering this chain to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants (1 and 5), we can identify the substituents:\n*   A methyl group on carbon 3.\n*   An ethyl group on carbon 4.\n\nAlphabetizing the substituents, the correct IUPAC name for the product is 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene.\n\nTherefore, heating 5-butylnona-2,6-diene results in the formation of 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
