    "### The observed absorption line corresponds to the Cold Atomic Interstellar Medium.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the observation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Absorption Line:** The first step is to determine the rest-frame energy of the observed absorption line. The light from an object at a distance of 2.1 gigaparsecs (Gpc) is significantly redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. A distance of 2.1 Gpc corresponds to a redshift (z) of approximately 0.5. The rest-frame energy (E_rest) can be calculated by correcting the observed energy (E_obs) for this redshift using the formula E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z).\n\n    *   E_obs = 3.9 µeV (3.9 x 10⁻⁶ eV)\n    *   z ≈ 0.5\n    *   E_rest ≈ 3.9 µeV * (1 + 0.5) = 5.85 µeV\n\n2.  **Match the Transition:** This rest-frame energy of ~5.85 µeV is characteristic of the well-known 21-cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI). This spectral line arises from the hyperfine \"spin-flip\" transition in the ground state of hydrogen atoms. The precise energy of this transition is about 5.874 µeV, which corresponds to a frequency of 1420.4 MHz. The calculated rest-frame energy is an excellent match for this transition.\n\n3.  **Determine the Interstellar Medium Phase:** The interstellar medium (ISM) is composed of different phases with varying temperatures and densities. The 21-cm line can be seen in emission from all neutral hydrogen, but it is most readily and strongly observed in absorption when there is cold gas in front of a brighter, background radio source. This is because the strength of the absorption depends on the \"spin temperature\" of the hydrogen gas, and colder gas produces a stronger absorption signal.\n\n    *   **Cold Neutral Medium (CNM):** This phase consists of cold (around 50-100 K) and relatively dense atomic hydrogen. The 21-cm absorption line is a primary tracer of the CNM.\n    *   **Warm Neutral Medium (WNM):** This phase is much hotter (around 6000-10,000 K) and less dense. While it contributes significantly to the overall 21-cm *emission*, its absorption signature is very weak.\n    *   **Molecular Medium:** This medium is dominated by molecular hydrogen (H₂), not atomic hydrogen, and is traced by other spectral lines (like those from carbon monoxide, CO).\n\nTherefore, an absorption line corresponding to the 21-cm transition of atomic hydrogen is most likely to be observed in the cold atomic phase of the interstellar medium.\n\n<<<D>>>"
