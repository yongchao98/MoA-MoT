    "To identify the unknown compound, a detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data is necessary.\n\n### Analysis of FTIR Data\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\nBoth pieces of FTIR data confirm that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. Since all four options are carboxylic acids, the FTIR data does not help distinguish between them but confirms the functional group present.\n\n### Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described. The n+1 rule states that a proton's signal is split into n+1 peaks by 'n' equivalent neighboring protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons, more complex patterns emerge.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four proposed structures are saturated alkanoic acids and are consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex multiplet indicates that a single proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A **doublet (d)** arises from coupling to one adjacent proton (n=1, so 1+1=2 peaks).\n    *   A **triplet (t)** arises from coupling to two adjacent protons (n=2, so 2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   A **quartet (q)** arises from coupling to three adjacent protons (n=3, so 3+1=4 peaks).\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This indicates a different proton is being split by:\n    *   A **doublet (d)** from one adjacent proton.\n    *   A **triplet (t)** from two adjacent protons.\n    *   Another **triplet (t)** from a different set of two adjacent protons.\n\n### Evaluating the Candidate Structures\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the methine (CH) protons in each candidate molecule.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the proton on C2 (doublet), the CH₂ of its ethyl group (triplet), and the CH₂ at C4 (triplet). This would produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, which matches one of the observed signals.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule would give a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq). For instance, the proton on C2 is coupled to the proton on C3 (doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (triplet), resulting in a doublet of triplets (dt). Therefore, this structure is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the proton on C2 (doublet), the CH₃ on C3 (quartet), and the CH₂ at C4 (triplet). This gives a doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt). This does not match the observed patterns.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the CH₂ at C2 (triplet), the proton on C4 (doublet), and the CH₃ on C3 (quartet). This gives a triplet of doublets of quartets (tdq). This does not match the observed patterns.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   Let's label the key protons: HOOC-CH₂(a)-CH(b)(Et)-CH(c)(Et)-CH₃\n    *   **Proton H(c) at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The single proton H(b) at C3, giving a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   The two protons of the CH₂ group in its ethyl substituent, giving a **triplet (t)**.\n        *   The three protons of the terminal CH₃ group at C5, giving a **quartet (q)**.\n        *   This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, exactly matching the first signal described.\n    *   **Proton H(b) at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The single proton H(c) at C4, giving a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   The two protons of the CH₂(a) group at C2, giving a **triplet (t)**.\n        *   The two protons of the CH₂ group in its own ethyl substituent, giving another **triplet (t)**.\n        *   This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, exactly matching the second signal described.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe splitting patterns observed in the ¹H NMR spectrum are uniquely consistent with the structure of 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
