    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z\n\nThe problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its general formula.\n\n*   The mass percentage of hydrogen is approximately 14.28%, which is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   If Z were an alkane with the formula CₙH₂ₙ₊₂, the mass fraction of hydrogen would be (2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n + 2) / (14n + 2). Setting this to 1/7 gives 14n + 14 = 14n + 2, which is impossible.\n*   If Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CₙH₂ₙ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7. This matches the given value of 14.28%.\n\nTherefore, Z is a cycloalkane. The problem also mentions that Z is widely used as a solvent. A very common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Composition of Mixture Y\n\nMixture Y is formed from the disproportionation of mixture X. Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. We also know that:\n*   Substance Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane).\n\nLet the two components of Y be C and D. We can set C = Z = cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). For the hydrogenation of Y to yield only cyclohexane, the other component, D, must also be converted into cyclohexane.\n\nThe reaction X → Y is a disproportionation, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One species is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen). Since one product is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), the fully reduced C₆ ring, the other product (D) is likely the fully dehydrogenated C₆ ring, which is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\nLet's check if this composition for Y fits the description:\n*   **Mixture Y = {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), benzene (C₆H₆)}**\n*   **Does not decolorize bromine water**: Correct. Cyclohexane is saturated, and benzene, due to its aromatic stability, does not react with bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   **Hydrogenation gives only Z**: Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane (C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂). This is consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction and Mixture X\n\nThe transformation of mixture X into mixture Y is a disproportionation reaction catalyzed by platinum. Since Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene, the reaction can be written as:\n\n**Component A + Component B (from Mixture X) → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ (Mixture Y)**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation. Both components of X must have a C₆ carbon skeleton because their hydrogenation leads to a C₆ product (cyclohexane). Let the formulas of the two components of X be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ.\n\nThe hydrogen balance is:\na + b = 12 + 6\na + b = 18\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is precisely the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component, which is 18.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Properties of Mixture X\n\nWe can further validate this by identifying plausible structures for the components of X.\n*   They must be unsaturated C₆ compounds to decolorize bromine water.\n*   They must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   The reaction C₆Hₐ + C₆Hₑ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ must be a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n\nA plausible scenario is the transfer of two hydrogen atoms:\n*   C₆H₁₀ + 2H → C₆H₁₂ (Reduction)\n*   C₆H₈ - 2H → C₆H₆ (Oxidation/Dehydrogenation)\n\nThis implies that mixture X is composed of a C₆H₁₀ isomer and a C₆H₈ isomer.\n*   **C₆H₁₀**: **Cyclohexene**. It has one double bond, decolorizes bromine water, and its hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. It does not have conjugated bonds.\n*   **C₆H₈**: A cyclohexadiene. To meet the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" condition, this must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**, not the conjugated 1,3-cyclohexadiene. 1,4-cyclohexadiene decolorizes bromine water and its hydrogenation also yields cyclohexane.\n\nThe disproportionation of cyclohexene and a cyclohexadiene over a platinum catalyst to yield cyclohexane and benzene is a known type of reaction, often referred to as Zelinsky irreversible catalysis.\n\nThus, a mixture X composed of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) fits all the conditions described in the problem. The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of these two liquids is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
