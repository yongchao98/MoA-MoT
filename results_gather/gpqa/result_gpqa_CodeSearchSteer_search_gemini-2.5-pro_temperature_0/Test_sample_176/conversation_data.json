    "To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which describes the power radiated from a black body. The luminosity (L) of a star is given by the formula:\n\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\n\nWhere:\n*   **R** is the radius of the star.\n*   **σ** (sigma) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **T** is the effective surface temperature of the star.\n\nWe can set up a ratio of the luminosities of the two stars:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nThe constants (4, π, and σ) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following information:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂), so R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n*   The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same.\n*   The radial velocity of Star_1 is 0 km/s, and for Star_2 it is 700 km/s.\n\nThe fact that the stars \"appeared\" brightest at the same wavelength implies that their *observed* peak wavelengths are identical. This observation is affected by the Doppler effect due to the stars' radial velocities. The light from Star_2, which is moving away from us, is redshifted, meaning its observed wavelength is longer than its intrinsic (source) wavelength.\n\nThe relationship between the observed peak wavelength (λ_obs) and the source peak wavelength (λ_source) is given by the Doppler shift formula. For non-relativistic speeds (as 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light), this is:\n\nλ_obs = λ_source * (1 + v/c)\n\nWhere **v** is the radial velocity and **c** is the speed of light.\n\nFor our stars:\n*   Star_1: v₁ = 0, so λ_obs,₁ = λ_source,₁\n*   Star_2: v₂ = 700 km/s, so λ_obs,₂ = λ_source,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nSince λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we have:\nλ_source,₁ = λ_source,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nNext, we use Wien's Displacement Law, which relates a star's surface temperature to its intrinsic peak emission wavelength: λ_source = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant. This means that the temperature is inversely proportional to the source wavelength (T = b/λ_source).\n\nThe ratio of the temperatures of the two stars is therefore:\nT₁ / T₂ = (b/λ_source,₁) / (b/λ_source,₂) = λ_source,₂ / λ_source,₁\n\nFrom our Doppler-derived relation, we can find this wavelength ratio:\nλ_source,₂ / λ_source,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\nSo, the temperature ratio is:\nT₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\nNow we can substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into our luminosity ratio equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value:\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s\n*   c ≈ 300,000 km/s\n*   v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.009365\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
