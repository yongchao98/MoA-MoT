    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\nToluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as nitration. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho, para-directing group, meaning it directs the incoming nitro group (-NO₂) to the positions ortho and para to itself. While both ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene are formed, the para isomer is typically the major product due to less steric hindrance. Therefore, Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is an oxidation reaction. While strong oxidizing agents like potassium permanganate can oxidize the methyl group to a carboxylic acid, MnO₂ is a milder reagent often used to oxidize benzylic alcohols to aldehydes. In the case of an activated methyl group like in p-nitrotoluene, MnO₂ with H₂SO₄ can facilitate oxidation to the aldehyde. Some sources indicate that under certain conditions, the reaction can proceed to the carboxylic acid, but oxidation to the aldehyde is a common outcome. Therefore, Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (which has no α-hydrogens and cannot self-condense). The initial aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated system. The final product, Product 3, is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n**Step 4: Molecular Symmetry of Product 3**\n\nThe structure of Product 3 is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. To determine its molecular symmetry group (point group), we must identify its symmetry elements.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a p-nitrophenyl group connected to a trans-butenone group (NO₂-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃).\n*   **Planarity:** Due to the extensive system of sp² hybridized atoms (the benzene ring, the C=C double bond, the C=O carbonyl group), the main framework of the molecule is approximately planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules possess this element.\n    *   **Rotation Axes (Cₙ):** There are no rotation axes (other than the trivial C₁). A C₂ axis cannot pass through the molecule because the two ends (the nitro group and the acetyl group) are different.\n    *   **Inversion Center (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** If we consider the plane that contains the benzene ring, the nitro group, the C=C double bond, and the carbonyl group, this plane acts as a mirror plane. One hydrogen of the methyl group can lie within this plane, while the other two hydrogens are positioned symmetrically above and below it, being reflections of each other.\n\nSince the molecule possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ), its molecular symmetry group is **Cₛ**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
