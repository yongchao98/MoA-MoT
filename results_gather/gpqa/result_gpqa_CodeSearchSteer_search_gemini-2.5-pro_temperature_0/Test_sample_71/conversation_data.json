    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Diene**\n\nThe first step involves the reaction of 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide (NaI) at an elevated temperature. The key transformation here is the reaction of the dibromo compound with NaI. While NaI is often used in Finkelstein reactions, in this context, a plausible, albeit non-standard, reaction is the reduction of the two dibromomethyl (-CHBr₂) groups to methyl (-CH₃) groups. This would require a hydrogen source, which could be the solvent (DMSO) or trace water. Assuming this reduction occurs, the diene formed is **5,6-dimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\nThe newly formed diene, 5,6-dimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene, reacts with the dienophile, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs, with one molecule of the diene adding to each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative. This forms product **1**, a complex polycyclic molecule.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection of the Ether**\n\nProduct **1** is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). The strong acid protonates the tert-butoxy group, which then leaves as a stable tert-butyl cation. The resulting oxygen is protonated by water, converting the ether into a secondary alcohol (-OH). This forms product **2**.\n\n**Step 4: Oxidation of the Alcohol**\n\nProduct **2** is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This combination of reagents is known as the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing secondary alcohols to ketones. The hydroxyl group at the C7 position is oxidized to a carbonyl group (C=O). This forms product **3**.\n\n**Step 5: Thermal Decomposition (Retro-Diels-Alder)**\n\nProduct **3** is heated to 150°C. Product 3 is a double Diels-Alder adduct. Such adducts, when heated, often undergo a reverse reaction called a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. This reaction breaks the molecule down into its original diene and dienophile components.\nThe fragmentation of product **3** yields two molecules of the diene (5,6-dimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene) and one molecule of the original dienophile core, which is now **7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene**.\n\n**Step 6: Formation of the Final Products**\n\nAt 150°C, 7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination (a type of pericyclic reaction) to release carbon monoxide (CO) and form the highly stable aromatic molecule, **benzene**.\n\nSo, the final mixture of products resulting from heating product **3** consists of benzene, carbon monoxide, and two molecules of 5,6-dimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product **4**. Since benzene (which has 1 type of hydrogen) is not an option, it is logical to conclude that product **4** refers to the other major organic product, 5,6-dimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: 5,6-dimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene**\n\nTo determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must look at the symmetry of the molecule. Due to rapid conformational changes, the time-averaged structure of 5,6-dimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene possesses a plane of symmetry (Cₛ) that bisects the C5-C6 bond.\n\nThis symmetry makes the following pairs of protons chemically equivalent:\n1.  The protons of the two methyl groups (-CH₃) are equivalent to each other.\n2.  The two allylic protons on C5 and C6 are equivalent.\n3.  The two vinylic protons on C1 and C4 are equivalent.\n4.  The two vinylic protons on C2 and C3 are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>"
