    "Here is a breakdown of the observations and an analysis of the potential explanations:\n\n### Analysis of the Observations\n\n*   **Compound:** A small, chemically synthesized peptidic compound. This is significant because chemical peptide synthesis is known to be susceptible to certain side reactions, including racemization.\n*   **Â¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   Two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n    *   The peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals that sum to one proton.\n    *   This indicates the presence of two different chemical environments for that specific proton, in a nearly 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Spin-spin coupling has been ruled out as the cause.\n*   **LC-MS Analysis:**\n    *   Two clearly defined peaks of equal intensity are observed. This shows that the crude product is a mixture of two components that can be separated by liquid chromatography. The equal intensities correlate with the equal integrals seen in the NMR.\n    *   Both LC peaks yield the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecular weight of the target peptide. This is a crucial piece of information, as it confirms both components are isomers of each other, not impurities with different chemical formulas (like a precursor or a common byproduct).\n    *   The analysis was performed at an elevated temperature. This suggests that the two species are stable and do not easily interconvert. If they were rapidly interconverting isomers (like some rotamers), the higher temperature would likely cause the two peaks to merge into a single, broader peak.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\n*   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** This is incorrect. A precursor would have a different molecular weight and thus a different mass spectrum. The data shows both components have the same mass as the final product.\n\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** This is the most likely explanation.\n    *   **Formation:** During peptide synthesis, the chiral center of an amino acid (the alpha-carbon) can undergo racemization (or epimerization), converting some of the L-amino acid to its D-form, or vice-versa. If this happens to one amino acid in a peptide that contains other chiral centers, the result is a mixture of diastereomers (e.g., an L-L peptide and a D-L peptide).\n    *   **NMR Properties:** Diastereomers are distinct chemical compounds with different physical properties. Therefore, they will have different NMR spectra. It is common for the signals of protons near the altered stereocenter, like the alpha-proton, to show distinct peaks for each diastereomer.\n    *   **LC-MS Properties:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can typically be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography, which would result in two separate peaks. As isomers, they have the same molecular formula and mass, so they would produce identical mass spectra. This aligns perfectly with all the provided data.\n\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** This is incorrect. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images that have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment. A standard NMR spectrometer is an achiral environment, so a mixture of enantiomers would produce a single set of peaks, not duplicate peaks for one proton. Likewise, enantiomers cannot be separated on a standard (achiral) LC column.\n\n*   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This term is ambiguous. If it refers to a side reaction like the formation of an N-acylurea, this would create an impurity with a different mass, which is inconsistent with the MS data. If it is meant to describe the process of racemization during the coupling step, then this is the *cause* of the diastereomer formation. However, option B is the most accurate *description* of the resulting mixture that explains all the analytical data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe observation of two alpha-proton peaks in the NMR and two separable peaks of identical mass in the LC-MS is the classic signature of a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers, likely formed by the racemization of one amino acid's alpha-carbon during the chemical synthesis.\n\n<<<B>>>"
