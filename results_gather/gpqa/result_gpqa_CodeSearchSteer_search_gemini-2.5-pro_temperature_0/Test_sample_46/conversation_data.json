    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) plus one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the formula and other data, this is likely an ester.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-). This is the first part of an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests this methylene group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a classic signal for the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to nitrogen's quadrupole moment and chemical exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two distinct signals. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH2), while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl).\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\n\nBased on the combined analysis:\n*   We have a **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)**.\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, which is also known as benzocaine. This structure is fully consistent with all the provided data: the molecular formula, the degree of unsaturation, and the IR and ¹H NMR spectra.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data provided corresponds to the following compound:\n\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**\n\n<<<C>>>"
