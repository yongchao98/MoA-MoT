    "The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for such a system are given by the formula:\n\n$E_n = (n + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega$\n\nwhere $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number, with $n_x, n_y, n_z$ being non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nThe energy states are as follows:\n*   **Ground state:** This corresponds to n = 0. The energy is $E_0 = (0 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (3/2) \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   **First excited state:** This corresponds to n = 1. The energy is $E_1 = (1 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (5/2) \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   **Second excited state:** This corresponds to n = 2. The energy is $E_2 = (2 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (7/2) \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   **Third excited state:** This corresponds to n = 3. The energy is $E_3 = (3 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (9/2) \\hbar \\omega$.\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level is known as the degeneracy of that level. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy, $g_n$, for a state with principal quantum number $n$ is given by the formula:\n\n$g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$\n\nFor the third excited state, n = 3. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n\n$g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10$\n\nThis degeneracy can also be found by counting the number of ways the non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ can be chosen to sum to 3:\n*   (3, 0, 0) and its 2 permutations: 3 states\n*   (2, 1, 0) and its 5 permutations: 6 states\n*   (1, 1, 1): 1 state\n\nThe total number of states is 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, and it has a degeneracy of 10.\n\n<<<A>>>"
