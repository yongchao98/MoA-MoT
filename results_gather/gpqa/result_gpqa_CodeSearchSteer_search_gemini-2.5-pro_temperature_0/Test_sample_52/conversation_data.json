    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Functional Groups and Core Structure:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₆) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The core formula of this part is C₆H₄. The ring itself accounts for four degrees of unsaturation (one for the ring and three for the double bonds).\n    *   **Ester group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms an ester group (-COO-). This group contains one carbon, two oxygen atoms, and a carbon-oxygen double bond, which adds one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **No –CH₂ groups:** The absence of signals for –CH₂ groups is a crucial constraint, eliminating many possible structures, such as those containing ethyl or propyl chains.\n\n2.  **Interpret the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons (C₆H₄). The presence of only two signals for these four protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a 1,4- (para) substitution, which would result in two distinct proton environments.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) attached to the aromatic ring.\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton, appearing as a doublet.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a quartet). The combined splitting results in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   This propenyl group (-C₃H₅) adds one more degree of unsaturation from its carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:**\n        *   One methyl signal corresponds to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-C**H₃**).\n        *   The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group. Since there are no –CH₂ groups, it cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOC**H₂**CH₃). Therefore, it must be either a methyl ester (-COOC**H₃**) or an acetate group (-OCOC**H₃**).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n\nLet's assemble the identified fragments to build the complete molecule and calculate its formula.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Group:** -CH=CH-CH₃ (which has a formula of C₃H₅)\n*   **Ester and second Methyl Group:** This must be either a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃, formula C₂H₃O₂) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃, formula C₂H₃O₂). Both possibilities have the same atomic count.\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms from these fragments:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** **2** (from C₂H₃O₂)\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation:**\nThe formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ has a degree of unsaturation of 6.\n(DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6).\nThe proposed structure contains:\n*   1 aromatic ring (4 degrees)\n*   1 vinyl C=C double bond (1 degree)\n*   1 ester C=O double bond (1 degree)\nThe total degrees of unsaturation for the structure is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6, which matches the calculated value from the formula.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\nThe spectroscopic data unambiguously points to a molecular structure with the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This corresponds to option B. Examples of such a compound would be methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate or 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
