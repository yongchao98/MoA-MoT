The fraction of particles that survive after a certain time is determined by their proper lifetime and the time dilation effect due to their high velocity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Survival Probability:** The probability `P` that a particle survives for a time `t` in the laboratory frame is given by the exponential decay law. This law depends on the particle's mean proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) and the Lorentz factor `γ`. The formula is:\n    `P(t) = exp(-t / (γ * τ))`\n    The time `t` it takes for the particles to reach the detector wall is the radius of the detector `R` divided by the particle's velocity `v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t ≈ R / c`.\n    Substituting this into the survival equation, we get the fraction of particles `N/N₀` reaching the wall:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n2.  **Applying the Initial Conditions:** We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁` is 20, one-third of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   `N/N₀ = 1/3`\n    *   `R = 30 m`\n\n    Plugging these values into the equation:\n    `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * c * τ))`\n\n    To solve for the unknown `c * τ` term, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ)`\n    `-ln(3) = -1.5 / (c * τ)`\n    `ln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ)`\n\n3.  **Applying the Target Conditions:** We want to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which two-thirds of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   `N/N₀ = 2/3`\n    *   `γ₂ = ?`\n\n    Using the same survival equation:\n    `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * c * τ))`\n\n    Taking the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n    `ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n\n4.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):** We now have a system of two equations:\n    1) `ln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ)`\n    2) `ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n\n    We can establish a ratio between these two equations to eliminate the `c * τ` term. Dividing the second equation by the first:\n    `ln(1.5) / ln(3) = (30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)) / (1.5 / (c * τ))`\n    `ln(1.5) / ln(3) = (30 / γ₂) / 1.5`\n    `ln(1.5) / ln(3) = 20 / γ₂`\n\n    Now, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`\n\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    *   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n    *   `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis calculated value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay. The fraction of particles that survive after a certain time is governed by the exponential decay law, which is modified by the Lorentz factor for particles moving at relativistic speeds.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Survival Fraction Formula**: The fraction of particles, *f*, that survive to reach the detector is given by the exponential decay law:\n    *f* = e<sup>(-t / τ_lab)</sup>\n    where *t* is the time of flight in the lab frame and τ_lab is the particle's lifetime as measured in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Time of Flight (t)**: The particles travel from the center to the inner wall of the detector, a distance equal to the radius *R* (30 m). Since they are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed *v* is approximately the speed of light *c*.\n    *t* ≈ *R* / *c*\n\n3.  **Lab-frame Lifetime (τ_lab)**: Due to time dilation, the lifetime of the moving particles is extended in the lab frame. It is related to the particle's proper lifetime (τ_proper, its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor, γ.\n    τ_lab = γ * τ_proper\n\n4.  **Combined Equation**: Substituting these into the survival fraction formula, we get:\n    *f* = e<sup>-(*R*/ *c*) / (γ * τ_proper)</sup>\n\n5.  **Setting up a Ratio**: We have two scenarios, and we can set up a ratio to solve for the unknown Lorentz factor without needing to know the proper lifetime of the particle. The term *R* / (*c* * τ_proper) is a constant for both scenarios. Let's call this constant *K*.\n    The formula can be rewritten as: -ln(*f*) = *K* / γ\n\n    *   **Scenario 1**: *f₁* = 1/3, γ₁ = 20\n    *   **Scenario 2**: *f₂* = 2/3, γ₂ = ?\n\n    From this, we can write:\n    γ₁ * [-ln(*f₁*)] = *K*\n    γ₂ * [-ln(*f₂*)] = *K*\n\n    Therefore:\n    γ₂ * [-ln(*f₂*)] = γ₁ * [-ln(*f₁*)]\n\n6.  **Solving for γ₂**: Now, we can plug in the known values and solve for γ₂.\n    γ₂ * [-ln(2/3)] = 20 * [-ln(1/3)]\n    γ₂ * [ln(3/2)] = 20 * [ln(3)]\n    γ₂ = 20 * [ln(3) / ln(1.5)]\n\n7.  **Calculation**:\n    *   ln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n    *   ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055\n    *   γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\n    *   γ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem deals with the exponential decay of relativistic particles. The fraction of particles that survive after traveling a certain distance depends on their lifetime, which is affected by time dilation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **The Survival Equation:**\n    The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial sample `N₀` after a time `t` in the lab frame is given by the decay law:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T_lab)`\n    where `T_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:**\n    Due to special relativity, the lifetime of a moving particle is dilated. The lab-frame lifetime `T_lab` is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `T_lab = γ * τ`\n\n3.  **Travel Time:**\n    The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time `t` it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` is:\n    `t ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combined Formula:**\n    Substituting the expressions for `T_lab` and `t` into the decay law, we get the fraction of particles `N/N₀` that reach the detector wall:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ)) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n    The term `cτ` is a constant property of the particle, representing its proper decay length.\n\n5.  **Using the Initial Condition:**\n    We are given that for a Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one-third of the particles reach the detector (`N₁/N₀ = 1/3`). The radius `R` is 30 m.\n    `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * cτ))`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)`\n    `-ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)`\n    `ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)`  (Equation 1)\n\n6.  **Setting up the Second Condition:**\n    We want to find the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` for which two-thirds of the particles reach the detector (`N₂/N₀ = 2/3`).\n    `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n    `ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`  (Equation 2)\n\n7.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n    We can solve for `γ₂` by dividing Equation 1 by Equation 2. This cancels out the unknown `cτ` term.\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = (1.5 / cτ) / (30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = (1.5 / cτ) * (γ₂ * cτ / 30)`\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = 1.5 * γ₂ / 30`\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = γ₂ / 20`\n\n    Now, we can isolate `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n8.  **Calculation:**\n    Using the values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the required Lorentz factor.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Particle Decay:**\n    The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by an exponential decay law. The number of particles, N, remaining at a time 't' from an initial population N₀ is given by:\n    N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t/τ)\n    Here, 't' is the time measured in the particle's own rest frame (this is called the proper time), and 'τ' is the mean proper lifetime of the particle, a constant for a given particle type.\n\n2.  **Relate Lab Frame and Particle's Rest Frame (Time Dilation):**\n    The problem is described from the perspective of the laboratory (the detector). The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the wall of the detector in the lab frame is `t_lab`.\n    However, due to time dilation from special relativity, the time experienced by the fast-moving particle (its proper time, `t_proper`) is shorter. The relationship is:\n    `t_lab = γ * t_proper`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle is `t_proper = t_lab / γ`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time of Flight in the Lab Frame:**\n    The particles travel a distance equal to the detector's radius, R = 30 m. They are ultra-relativistic, meaning their speed `v` is extremely close to the speed of light, `c`. We can approximate `v ≈ c`.\n    So, the time of flight in the lab frame is:\n    `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combine the Concepts for the First Scenario:**\n    *   Initial Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n    *   Fraction of particles reaching the wall is 1/3. This means N/N₀ = 1/3.\n    *   The proper time for this scenario is `t_proper₁ = t_lab / γ₁ ≈ (R/c) / γ₁`.\n    *   Plugging this into the decay equation:\n        `1/3 = e^(-t_proper₁ / τ) = e^(-(R / (c * γ₁ * τ)))`\n\n5.  **Analyze the First Scenario Equation:**\n    To solve this, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = - (R / (c * γ₁ * τ))`\n    Using the property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `-ln(3) = - (R / (c * γ₁ * τ))`\n    `ln(3) = R / (c * γ₁ * τ)`\n    This equation relates the known `γ₁` to the unknown constants `R`, `c`, and `τ`. We can rearrange it to find an expression for the constant group `R / (c * τ)`:\n    `R / (c * τ) = γ₁ * ln(3)`\n\n6.  **Formulate the Equation for the Second Scenario:**\n    *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    *   The fraction of particles reaching the wall is 2/3. So, N/N₀ = 2/3.\n    *   The proper time for this scenario is `t_proper₂ = t_lab / γ₂ ≈ (R/c) / γ₂`.\n    *   Plugging this into the decay equation:\n        `2/3 = e^(-t_proper₂ / τ) = e^(-(R / (c * γ₂ * τ)))`\n\n7.  **Analyze the Second Scenario Equation and Solve for γ₂:**\n    Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = - (R / (c * γ₂ * τ))`\n    Using the property `ln(x/y) = -ln(y/x)`:\n    `-ln(3/2) = - (R / (c * γ₂ * τ))`\n    `ln(3/2) = R / (c * γ₂ * τ)`\n    Rearranging for the constant group `R / (c * τ)`:\n    `R / (c * τ) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n8.  **Equate the Expressions and Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    We now have two different expressions for the same constant group `R / (c * τ)`. We can set them equal to each other:\n    `γ₁ * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n    We can now solve for the unknown `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = γ₁ * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n    Now, substitute the known value `γ₁ = 20`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(1.5))`\n    Using the approximate values for the logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Proper Time:** The most critical point is to use the proper time (`t_proper`) in the exponential decay formula, not the lab time (`t_lab`).\n*   **Time Dilation:** Correctly applying the time dilation formula `t_proper = t_lab / γ` is essential. A higher Lorentz factor `γ` means the particle experiences less time, and therefore less decay.\n*   **Constant Grouping:** Realizing that `R`, `c`, and `τ` are all constants allows you to solve the problem without needing their specific values. The ratio of the two scenarios cancels them out.\n*   **Logical Check:** To have more particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must decay less. For a fixed travel distance, this means they must experience less proper time. This requires a *higher* Lorentz factor. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is higher than `γ₁ = 20`, which makes physical sense.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.18, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem describes the decay of relativistic particles. The fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that survive after traveling a distance `R` is given by the exponential decay law:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n\nwhere `t_lab` is the time of flight in the lab frame and `τ_lab` is the particle's lifetime in the lab frame.\n\n1.  **Time of Flight (`t_lab`):** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The detector has a radius `R`. The time to reach the wall is:\n    `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n2.  **Lifetime in Lab Frame (`τ_lab`):** Due to time dilation, the lifetime of a particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` is longer in the lab frame than its proper lifetime `τ_proper` (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`\n\n3.  **Combined Equation:** Substituting these into the decay equation gives the fraction of particles reaching the detector:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n    We can group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ_proper` into a single constant `K = R / (c * τ_proper)`, as these values do not change between the two scenarios.\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n4.  **Using the First Condition:** We are given that for a Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one-third (`1/3`) of the particles reach the detector.\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n5.  **Solving for the Second Condition:** We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which two-thirds (`2/3`) of the particles reach the detector.\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    Again, take the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    Now, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`\n    Substitute the value of `K` we found in the previous step:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we can simplify this to:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n    `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n    `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055 ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19, which is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe problem relates the fraction of surviving particles to their Lorentz factor. The fraction of particles `N/N₀` that survive a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n\nwhere `τ_lab` is the particle's mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n\nDue to time dilation from special relativity, the lifetime in the lab frame is related to the proper lifetime `τ₀` (the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n\n`τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n\nThe time `t` it takes for the particles to reach the detector wall of radius `R` is `t = R/v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`, so `t ≈ R/c`.\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, we get:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\nLet's analyze the two given scenarios.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction of survivors, `(N/N₀)₁ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (20 * τ₀))`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ₀)`\n`-ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ₀)`\n`ln(3) = (R/c) / (20 * τ₀)`  (Equation 1)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n*   The desired fraction of survivors is `(N/N₀)₂ = 2/3`.\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`2/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀))`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)`\n`-ln(3/2) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)`\n`ln(3/2) = (R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)`  (Equation 2)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations. The term `(R/c) / τ₀` is a constant for this particle and detector setup. We can find a relationship between the two scenarios by dividing Equation 1 by Equation 2:\n\n`(ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = [ (R/c) / (20 * τ₀) ] / [ (R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀) ]`\n\nThe term `(R/c) / τ₀` cancels out:\n`ln(3) / ln(3/2) = γ₂ / 20`\n\nNow, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\nUsing the provided calculation:\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe problem asks for the new Lorentz factor (`γ₂`) required for two-thirds of particles to reach a detector, given that at a Lorentz factor of `γ₁ = 20`, one-third of them reach it.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Particle Decay:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t` in a specific reference frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ)`\n    where `τ` is the mean lifetime of the particles in that same reference frame.\n\n2.  **Lab Frame vs. Particle Frame:** We are observing the decay from the lab's frame of reference.\n    *   The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the wall of the detector (radius `R = 30 m`) in the lab frame is `t_lab`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n        `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n    *   The mean lifetime of the particles in the lab frame, `τ_lab`, is dilated relative to their proper lifetime `τ₀` (their lifetime in their own rest frame). This is described by the time dilation formula:\n        `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n        where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Fraction of Surviving Particles:** Substituting `t_lab` and `τ_lab` into the decay equation, we get the fraction of particles that reach the detector wall:\n    `f = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab) = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n    We can group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ₀` into a single constant `k = R / (c * τ₀)`. The equation becomes:\n    `f = exp(-k / γ)`\n\n4.  **Applying the Given Scenarios:**\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n        *   Fraction surviving, `f₁ = 1/3`\n        *   Plugging these values in: `1/3 = exp(-k / 20)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   Fraction surviving, `f₂ = 2/3`\n        *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n        *   Plugging these values in: `2/3 = exp(-k / γ₂)`\n\n5.  **Solving for `γ₂`:**\n    From Scenario 1, we can solve for the constant `k`. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -k / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -k / 20`\n    `k = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    Now, substitute this expression for `k` into the equation for Scenario 2:\n    `2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)`\n\n    Take the natural logarithm of both sides again:\n    `ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    `ln(2) - ln(3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\n    Multiply by -1:\n    `ln(3) - ln(2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\n    Finally, rearrange to solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    Using the properties of logarithms, `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, the denominator can be simplified:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)`\n\n    Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n    *   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n    *   `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055 ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.

Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R/c`.\n\nThe lifetime of the particles in the lab frame is dilated by the Lorentz factor: `t_dilated = γ * τ`.\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive is given by `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / t_dilated)`.\nSubstituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `t_dilated`, we get:\n`f = exp(- (R/c) / (γ * τ) ) = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ))`\n\nLet's define a constant `K = R / (c * τ)`, which depends on the detector setup and the particle's intrinsic properties, but not on the Lorentz factor.

Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime appears longer in the lab frame. The dilated lifetime, `τ'`, is given by:\n    `τ' = γτ`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    The decay law in the lab frame, for a time `t_lab`, becomes:\n    `N/N₀ = e^(-t_lab / τ') = e^(-t_lab / (γτ))`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time of Flight in the Lab Frame:**\n    The particles are created at the center and travel to the inner wall of the spherical detector.\n    *   Radius of the detector, `R = 30 m`.\n    *   The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`.\n    *   The time it takes to reach the wall in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the First Scenario:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n    *   Fraction of particles reaching the wall (surviving) = `1/3`.\n    *   Using the decay formula from Step 2:\n        `1/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (γ₁τ))`\n    *   Substitute `γ₁ = 20`:\n        `1/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (20τ))`\n    *   To solve for the unknown term `(R/c)/τ`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -(R/c) / (20τ)`\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n        `-ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20τ)`\n    *   This gives us a value for the constant term that depends on the particle and detector properties:\n        `(R/c) / τ = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n5.  **Analyze the Second Scenario:**\n    *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    *   The desired fraction of particles reaching the wall is `2/3`.\n    *   Set up the decay equation for this scenario:\n        `2/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (γ₂τ))`\n    *   Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = -(R/c) / (γ₂τ)`\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`:\n        `-ln(3/2) = -(R/c) / (γ₂τ)`\n    *   This gives us another expression:\n        `(R/c) / τ = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n    We now have two expressions for the same constant `(R/c) / τ`. We can set them equal to each other:\n    `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    Now, isolate `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2)))`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Use the standard values for natural logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(2) ≈ 0.6931`.\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / (1.0986 - 0.6931))`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.

This effect is well-documented and experimentally verified, for example, with muons traveling through the atmosphere.\n\nMy derivation combined these two principles.\n\nLet's re-state the relationship I derived:\nγ₂ = γ₁ * ln(1/P₁) / ln(1/P₂)\n\nWhere:\n- γ₁ = 20 (initial Lorentz factor)\n- P₁ = 1/3 (initial survival probability)\n- P₂ = 2/3 (target survival probability)\n- γ₂ = target Lorentz factor\n\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(1 / (1/3)) / ln(1 / (2/3))\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n\nThe calculation was:\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / (ln(3) - ln(2))\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / (1.0986 - 0.6931)\nγ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThe calculation is robust and based on well-established physics principles confirmed by the search results. The closest answer is 54.\n\nThe steps are logical and the calculation is correct. I am confident in the result.\n\nFinal check of the question and options.\n- Initial state: γ=20, 1/3 reach the detector.\n- Target state: γ=?, 2/3 reach the detector.\n- Detector radius R = 30m.\n- Options: A) 68, B) 40, C) 54, D) 28.\n\nMy calculated value of ~54.2 is extremely close to option C.\n\nThe survival probability P is given by P = exp(-t_flight / t_lab).\nThe time of flight t_flight is R/v. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, v ≈ c, so t_flight ≈ R/c.\nThe lifetime in the lab frame t_lab is γτ, where τ is the proper lifetime.\nSo, P = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ)).\n\nTaking the natural logarithm:\nln(P) = -(R/c) / (γτ)\n-ln(P) * γ = (R/c) / τ\n\nSince R, c, and τ are constants for this particle and setup, the product -ln(P) * γ must be constant.\n-ln(P₁) * γ₁ = -ln(P₂) * γ₂\n-ln(1/3) * 20 = -ln(2/3) * γ₂\nln(3) * 20 = ln(3/2) * γ₂\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\nγ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThe logic holds up perfectly. The answer is C.The problem requires finding the new Lorentz factor (γ₂) that allows two-thirds of particles to reach a detector, given that at a Lorentz factor (γ₁) of ~20, only one-third reach it. This involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and the law of radioactive decay.\n\n### 1. Understanding Particle Decay and Time Dilation\nUnstable particles decay over time, following an exponential decay law. The number of particles N remaining at time t from an initial sample N₀ is given by:\nN(t) = N₀ * e^(-t / τ_lab)\n\nHere, τ_lab is the mean lifetime of the particles as measured in the laboratory frame.\n\nAccording to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time is relative. For a particle moving at a relativistic speed, its internal clock runs slower as observed from a stationary frame (the lab). This phenomenon is called time dilation. The lifetime of the particle in the lab frame (τ_lab) is related to its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, τ_proper) by the Lorentz factor, γ:\nτ_lab = γ * τ_proper\n\nThe Lorentz factor is defined as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²), where v is the particle's velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Equations\nThe fraction of particles that reach the detector is the survival probability, P = N(t) / N₀. The time t it takes for the particles to travel from the center to the detector wall (radius R = 30 m) is t = R / v. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity v is approximately the speed of light c.\nSo, t ≈ R / c.\n\nThe survival probability can be written as:\nP = e^(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))\n\n### 3. Using the Given Information\nWe are given two scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, P₁ = 1/3\n\nSubstituting these into our equation:\n1/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (20 * τ_proper))\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ_proper)\n-ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ_proper)\n20 * ln(3) = (R/c) / τ_proper\n\nThe term (R/c) / τ_proper is a constant that depends on the detector size and the type of particle.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, P₂ = 2/3\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂.\n\nThe equation for this scenario is:\n2/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ_proper))\n\nTaking the natural logarithm:\nln(2/3) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ_proper)\n-ln(3/2) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ_proper)\nγ₂ * ln(3/2) = (R/c) / τ_proper\n\n### 4. Solving for the New Lorentz Factor\nNow we have two expressions for the constant (R/c) / τ_proper. We can set them equal to each other:\nγ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)\n\nNow, we solve for γ₂:\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(2) ≈ 0.6931):\nln(3/2) = ln(3) - ln(2) ≈ 1.0986 - 0.6931 = 0.4055\n\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nProposer: The problem requires us to find the necessary Lorentz factor (γ) for a specific fraction of particles to survive and reach a detector wall. This can be solved by using the relativistic particle decay formula.\n\nMy proposed solution is as follows:\n1.  Define the survival fraction of particles using the exponential decay law, incorporating time dilation. The number of particles N at a time t in the lab frame is given by N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / (γ * τ)), where N₀ is the initial number, τ is the proper lifetime, and γ is the Lorentz factor.\n2.  The time `t` for a particle to travel the detector radius `R` is `t = R/v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, we can approximate their velocity `v` as the speed of light `c`, so `t ≈ R/c`.\n3.  Set up two equations based on the two scenarios given:\n    *   Scenario 1: γ₁ = 20, and the survival fraction N/N₀ = 1/3. This gives: 1/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (20 * τ)).\n    *   Scenario 2: γ₂ is unknown, and the survival fraction N/N₀ = 2/3. This gives: 2/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ)).\n4.  Solve these two equations to find γ₂. By taking the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation and then taking their ratio, the unknown terms `R/c` and `τ` will cancel out, allowing for a direct calculation of γ₂.\n\nMy proposed action is to perform a search to get the precise values of the natural logarithms needed for the calculation.\n\nSkeptic: The proposed path is logical. The use of the relativistic decay formula is appropriate, and the method of solving the two simultaneous equations by taking their ratio is efficient as it eliminates the unknown proper lifetime (τ) and the `R/c` term. The search results provide the necessary high-precision values for the natural logarithms.\n\nLet's verify the calculation with the retrieved values.\n*   From the search results, ln(3) ≈ 1.09861228867.\n*   From the search results, ln(2) ≈ 0.693147.\n*   We need to calculate ln(3/2), which is ln(3) - ln(2).\n    *   ln(3/2) ≈ 1.09861228867 - 0.69314718056 = 0.40546510811\n*   The formula for the new Lorentz factor is γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2)).\n    *   γ₂ = 20 * (1.09861228867 / 0.40546510811)\n    *   γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.70951129\n    *   γ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThe calculation is correct. The result, approximately 54.2, is extremely close to the answer choice D) 54. The minor difference can be attributed to the initial condition stating the Lorentz factor is \"~20\".\n\nThe debate converges.

The fraction of particles that survive after a certain time is determined by their proper lifetime and the time dilation effect due to their high velocity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Survival Probability:** The probability `P` that a particle survives for a time `t` in the laboratory frame is given by the exponential decay law. This law depends on the particle's mean proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) and the Lorentz factor `γ`. The formula is:\n    `P(t) = exp(-t / (γ * τ))`\n    The time `t` it takes for the particles to reach the detector wall is the radius of the detector `R` divided by the particle's velocity `v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t ≈ R / c`.\n    Substituting this into the survival equation, we get the fraction of particles `N/N₀` reaching the wall:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n2.  **Applying the Initial Conditions:** We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁` is 20, one-third of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   `N/N₀ = 1/3`\n    *   `R = 30 m`\n\n    Plugging these values into the equation:\n    `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * c * τ))`\n\n    To solve for the unknown `c * τ` term, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ)`\n    `-ln(3) = -1.5 / (c * τ)`\n    `ln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ)`\n\n3.  **Applying the Target Conditions:** We want to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which two-thirds of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   `N/N₀ = 2/3`\n    *   `γ₂ = ?`\n\n    Using the same survival equation:\n    `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * c * τ))`\n\n    Taking the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n    `ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n\n4.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):** We now have a system of two equations:\n    1) `ln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ)`\n    2) `ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n\n    We can establish a ratio between these two equations to eliminate the `c * τ` term. Dividing the second equation by the first:\n    `ln(1.5) / ln(3) = (30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)) / (1.5 / (c * τ))`\n    `ln(1.5) / ln(3) = (30 / γ₂) / 1.5`\n    `ln(1.5) / ln(3) = 20 / γ₂`\n\n    Now, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`\n\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    *   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n    *   `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis calculated value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay. The fraction of particles that survive after a certain time is governed by the exponential decay law, which is modified by the Lorentz factor for particles moving at relativistic speeds.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Survival Fraction Formula**: The fraction of particles, *f*, that survive to reach the detector is given by the exponential decay law:\n    *f* = e<sup>(-t / τ_lab)</sup>\n    where *t* is the time of flight in the lab frame and τ_lab is the particle's lifetime as measured in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Time of Flight (t)**: The particles travel from the center to the inner wall of the detector, a distance equal to the radius *R* (30 m). Since they are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed *v* is approximately the speed of light *c*.\n    *t* ≈ *R* / *c*\n\n3.  **Lab-frame Lifetime (τ_lab)**: Due to time dilation, the lifetime of the moving particles is extended in the lab frame. It is related to the particle's proper lifetime (τ_proper, its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor, γ.\n    τ_lab = γ * τ_proper\n\n4.  **Combined Equation**: Substituting these into the survival fraction formula, we get:\n    *f* = e<sup>-(*R*/ *c*) / (γ * τ_proper)</sup>\n\n5.  **Setting up a Ratio**: We have two scenarios, and we can set up a ratio to solve for the unknown Lorentz factor without needing to know the proper lifetime of the particle. The term *R* / (*c* * τ_proper) is a constant for both scenarios. Let's call this constant *K*.\n    The formula can be rewritten as: -ln(*f*) = *K* / γ\n\n    *   **Scenario 1**: *f₁* = 1/3, γ₁ = 20\n    *   **Scenario 2**: *f₂* = 2/3, γ₂ = ?\n\n    From this, we can write:\n    γ₁ * [-ln(*f₁*)] = *K*\n    γ₂ * [-ln(*f₂*)] = *K*\n\n    Therefore:\n    γ₂ * [-ln(*f₂*)] = γ₁ * [-ln(*f₁*)]\n\n6.  **Solving for γ₂**: Now, we can plug in the known values and solve for γ₂.\n    γ₂ * [-ln(2/3)] = 20 * [-ln(1/3)]\n    γ₂ * [ln(3/2)] = 20 * [ln(3)]\n    γ₂ = 20 * [ln(3) / ln(1.5)]\n\n7.  **Calculation**:\n    *   ln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n    *   ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055\n    *   γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\n    *   γ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem deals with the exponential decay of relativistic particles. The fraction of particles that survive after traveling a certain distance depends on their lifetime, which is affected by time dilation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **The Survival Equation:**\n    The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial sample `N₀` after a time `t` in the lab frame is given by the decay law:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T_lab)`\n    where `T_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:**\n    Due to special relativity, the lifetime of a moving particle is dilated. The lab-frame lifetime `T_lab` is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `T_lab = γ * τ`\n\n3.  **Travel Time:**\n    The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time `t` it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` is:\n    `t ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combined Formula:**\n    Substituting the expressions for `T_lab` and `t` into the decay law, we get the fraction of particles `N/N₀` that reach the detector wall:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ)) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n    The term `cτ` is a constant property of the particle, representing its proper decay length.\n\n5.  **Using the Initial Condition:**\n    We are given that for a Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one-third of the particles reach the detector (`N₁/N₀ = 1/3`). The radius `R` is 30 m.\n    `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * cτ))`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)`\n    `-ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)`\n    `ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)`  (Equation 1)\n\n6.  **Setting up the Second Condition:**\n    We want to find the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` for which two-thirds of the particles reach the detector (`N₂/N₀ = 2/3`).\n    `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n    `ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`  (Equation 2)\n\n7.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n    We can solve for `γ₂` by dividing Equation 1 by Equation 2. This cancels out the unknown `cτ` term.\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = (1.5 / cτ) / (30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = (1.5 / cτ) * (γ₂ * cτ / 30)`\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = 1.5 * γ₂ / 30`\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = γ₂ / 20`\n\n    Now, we can isolate `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n8.  **Calculation:**\n    Using the values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the required Lorentz factor.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Particle Decay:**\n    The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by an exponential decay law. The number of particles, N, remaining at a time 't' from an initial population N₀ is given by:\n    N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t/τ)\n    Here, 't' is the time measured in the particle's own rest frame (this is called the proper time), and 'τ' is the mean proper lifetime of the particle, a constant for a given particle type.\n\n2.  **Relate Lab Frame and Particle's Rest Frame (Time Dilation):**\n    The problem is described from the perspective of the laboratory (the detector). The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the wall of the detector in the lab frame is `t_lab`.\n    However, due to time dilation from special relativity, the time experienced by the fast-moving particle (its proper time, `t_proper`) is shorter. The relationship is:\n    `t_lab = γ * t_proper`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle is `t_proper = t_lab / γ`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time of Flight in the Lab Frame:**\n    The particles travel a distance equal to the detector's radius, R = 30 m. They are ultra-relativistic, meaning their speed `v` is extremely close to the speed of light, `c`. We can approximate `v ≈ c`.\n    So, the time of flight in the lab frame is:\n    `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combine the Concepts for the First Scenario:**\n    *   Initial Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n    *   Fraction of particles reaching the wall is 1/3. This means N/N₀ = 1/3.\n    *   The proper time for this scenario is `t_proper₁ = t_lab / γ₁ ≈ (R/c) / γ₁`.\n    *   Plugging this into the decay equation:\n        `1/3 = e^(-t_proper₁ / τ) = e^(-(R / (c * γ₁ * τ)))`\n\n5.  **Analyze the First Scenario Equation:**\n    To solve this, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = - (R / (c * γ₁ * τ))`\n    Using the property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `-ln(3) = - (R / (c * γ₁ * τ))`\n    `ln(3) = R / (c * γ₁ * τ)`\n    This equation relates the known `γ₁` to the unknown constants `R`, `c`, and `τ`. We can rearrange it to find an expression for the constant group `R / (c * τ)`:\n    `R / (c * τ) = γ₁ * ln(3)`\n\n6.  **Formulate the Equation for the Second Scenario:**\n    *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    *   The fraction of particles reaching the wall is 2/3.

We can set them equal to each other:\n    `γ₁ * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n    We can now solve for the unknown `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = γ₁ * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n    Now, substitute the known value `γ₁ = 20`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(1.5))`\n    Using the approximate values for the logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Proper Time:** The most critical point is to use the proper time (`t_proper`) in the exponential decay formula, not the lab time (`t_lab`).\n*   **Time Dilation:** Correctly applying the time dilation formula `t_proper = t_lab / γ` is essential. A higher Lorentz factor `γ` means the particle experiences less time, and therefore less decay.\n*   **Constant Grouping:** Realizing that `R`, `c`, and `τ` are all constants allows you to solve the problem without needing their specific values. The ratio of the two scenarios cancels them out.\n*   **Logical Check:** To have more particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must decay less. For a fixed travel distance, this means they must experience less proper time. This requires a *higher* Lorentz factor. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is higher than `γ₁ = 20`, which makes physical sense.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.18, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem describes the decay of relativistic particles. The fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that survive after traveling a distance `R` is given by the exponential decay law:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n\nwhere `t_lab` is the time of flight in the lab frame and `τ_lab` is the particle's lifetime in the lab frame.\n\n1.  **Time of Flight (`t_lab`):** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The detector has a radius `R`. The time to reach the wall is:\n    `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n2.  **Lifetime in Lab Frame (`τ_lab`):** Due to time dilation, the lifetime of a particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` is longer in the lab frame than its proper lifetime `τ_proper` (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`\n\n3.  **Combined Equation:** Substituting these into the decay equation gives the fraction of particles reaching the detector:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n    We can group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ_proper` into a single constant `K = R / (c * τ_proper)`, as these values do not change between the two scenarios.\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n4.  **Using the First Condition:** We are given that for a Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one-third (`1/3`) of the particles reach the detector.\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n5.  **Solving for the Second Condition:** We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which two-thirds (`2/3`) of the particles reach the detector.\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    Again, take the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    Now, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`\n    Substitute the value of `K` we found in the previous step:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we can simplify this to:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n    `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n    `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055 ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19, which is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe problem relates the fraction of surviving particles to their Lorentz factor. The fraction of particles `N/N₀` that survive a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n\nwhere `τ_lab` is the particle's mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n\nDue to time dilation from special relativity, the lifetime in the lab frame is related to the proper lifetime `τ₀` (the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n\n`τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n\nThe time `t` it takes for the particles to reach the detector wall of radius `R` is `t = R/v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`, so `t ≈ R/c`.\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, we get:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\nLet's analyze the two given scenarios.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction of survivors, `(N/N₀)₁ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (20 * τ₀))`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ₀)`\n`-ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ₀)`\n`ln(3) = (R/c) / (20 * τ₀)`  (Equation 1)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n*   The desired fraction of survivors is `(N/N₀)₂ = 2/3`.\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`2/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀))`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)`\n`-ln(3/2) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)`\n`ln(3/2) = (R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)`  (Equation 2)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations. The term `(R/c) / τ₀` is a constant for this particle and detector setup. We can find a relationship between the two scenarios by dividing Equation 1 by Equation 2:\n\n`(ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = [ (R/c) / (20 * τ₀) ] / [ (R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀) ]`\n\nThe term `(R/c) / τ₀` cancels out:\n`ln(3) / ln(3/2) = γ₂ / 20`\n\nNow, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\nUsing the provided calculation:\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe problem asks for the new Lorentz factor (`γ₂`) required for two-thirds of particles to reach a detector, given that at a Lorentz factor of `γ₁ = 20`, one-third of them reach it.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Particle Decay:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t` in a specific reference frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ)`\n    where `τ` is the mean lifetime of the particles in that same reference frame.\n\n2.  **Lab Frame vs. Particle Frame:** We are observing the decay from the lab's frame of reference.\n    *   The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the wall of the detector (radius `R = 30 m`) in the lab frame is `t_lab`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n        `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n    *   The mean lifetime of the particles in the lab frame, `τ_lab`, is dilated relative to their proper lifetime `τ₀` (their lifetime in their own rest frame). This is described by the time dilation formula:\n        `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n        where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Fraction of Surviving Particles:** Substituting `t_lab` and `τ_lab` into the decay equation, we get the fraction of particles that reach the detector wall:\n    `f = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab) = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n    We can group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ₀` into a single constant `k = R / (c * τ₀)`. The equation becomes:\n    `f = exp(-k / γ)`\n\n4.  **Applying the Given Scenarios:**\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n        *   Fraction surviving, `f₁ = 1/3`\n        *   Plugging these values in: `1/3 = exp(-k / 20)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   Fraction surviving, `f₂ = 2/3`\n        *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n        *   Plugging these values in: `2/3 = exp(-k / γ₂)`\n\n5.  **Solving for `γ₂`:**\n    From Scenario 1, we can solve for the constant `k`. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -k / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -k / 20`\n    `k = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    Now, substitute this expression for `k` into the equation for Scenario 2:\n    `2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)`\n\n    Take the natural logarithm of both sides again:\n    `ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    `ln(2) - ln(3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\n    Multiply by -1:\n    `ln(3) - ln(2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\n    Finally, rearrange to solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    Using the properties of logarithms, `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, the denominator can be simplified:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)`\n\n    Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n    *   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n    *   `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055 ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.

Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R/c`.\n\nThe lifetime of the particles in the lab frame is dilated by the Lorentz factor: `t_dilated = γ * τ`.\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive is given by `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / t_dilated)`.\nSubstituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `t_dilated`, we get:\n`f = exp(- (R/c) / (γ * τ) ) = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ))`\n\nLet's define a constant `K = R / (c * τ)`, which depends on the detector setup and the particle's intrinsic properties, but not on the Lorentz factor. The equation becomes:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for `K`:\n`ln(f) = -K / γ`\n`K = -γ * ln(f) = γ * ln(1/f)`\n\nSince `K` is the same for both scenarios, we can write:\n`γ₁ * ln(1/f₁) = γ₂ * ln(1/f₂)`\n\nNow, we plug in the values from the problem:\n*   Scenario 1: `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n*   Scenario 2: `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n`20 * ln(1 / (1/3)) = γ₂ * ln(1 / (2/3))`\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, we solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\nUsing the values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.

The fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that survive after a time `t` in their own rest frame is given by:\n    `N/N₀ = e^(-t/τ)`\n    where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle (a constant for a given particle type).\n\n2.  **Incorporate Special Relativity (Time Dilation):**\n    The particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds relative to the detector (the lab frame). Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime appears longer in the lab frame. The dilated lifetime, `τ'`, is given by:\n    `τ' = γτ`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    The decay law in the lab frame, for a time `t_lab`, becomes:\n    `N/N₀ = e^(-t_lab / τ') = e^(-t_lab / (γτ))`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time of Flight in the Lab Frame:**\n    The particles are created at the center and travel to the inner wall of the spherical detector.\n    *   Radius of the detector, `R = 30 m`.\n    *   The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`.\n    *   The time it takes to reach the wall in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the First Scenario:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n    *   Fraction of particles reaching the wall (surviving) = `1/3`.\n    *   Using the decay formula from Step 2:\n        `1/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (γ₁τ))`\n    *   Substitute `γ₁ = 20`:\n        `1/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (20τ))`\n    *   To solve for the unknown term `(R/c)/τ`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -(R/c) / (20τ)`\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n        `-ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20τ)`\n    *   This gives us a value for the constant term that depends on the particle and detector properties:\n        `(R/c) / τ = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n5.  **Analyze the Second Scenario:**\n    *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    *   The desired fraction of particles reaching the wall is `2/3`.\n    *   Set up the decay equation for this scenario:\n        `2/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (γ₂τ))`\n    *   Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = -(R/c) / (γ₂τ)`\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`:\n        `-ln(3/2) = -(R/c) / (γ₂τ)`\n    *   This gives us another expression:\n        `(R/c) / τ = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n    We now have two expressions for the same constant `(R/c) / τ`. We can set them equal to each other:\n    `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    Now, isolate `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2)))`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Use the standard values for natural logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(2) ≈ 0.6931`.\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / (1.0986 - 0.6931))`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.

The relationship is exponential, which requires the use of natural logarithms to solve.\n*   **Constant Term:** The term `(R/c)/τ` combines all the fixed parameters of the system (detector size and particle's proper lifetime). Solving for this term in the first scenario is the key to solving the second.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe fraction of particles, `f`, that survive to travel a distance `R` is given by the exponential decay law, where the time is considered in the particle's own reference frame (proper time, `t_p`).\n\n`f = N/N₀ = exp(-t_p / τ)`\n\nwhere `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n\nThe time it takes for the particle to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n\nDue to time dilation, the proper time `t_p` experienced by the particle is related to the lab time `t_lab` by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n\n`t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ`\n\nSubstituting this into the decay equation:\n\n`f = exp(-(R / (c * γ)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\nLet's define a constant `K = R / (c * τ)`. This value is constant for this experiment since the detector radius `R` and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` do not change. The equation simplifies to:\n\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\nWe are given two cases:\n\n**Case 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction surviving, `f₁ = 1/3`\n\n`1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Case 2:**\n*   Fraction surviving, `f₂ = 2/3`\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\n`2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n`γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`\n\nNow, substitute the value of `K` we found from Case 1:\n`γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n`γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\nUsing the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(2) ≈ 0.6931`:\n`γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / (1.0986 - 0.6931)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is closest to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and the formula for exponential decay.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physics\n\n1.  **Particle Decay:** The number of particles, N, that survive after a time, t, in the laboratory's frame of reference is given by the exponential decay law:\n    N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_lab)\n    where N₀ is the initial number of particles and τ_lab is the average lifetime of the particles in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a particle as measured in the lab frame (τ_lab) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, τ₀) due to time dilation. This relationship is defined by the Lorentz factor (γ):\n    τ_lab = γ * τ₀\n    This phenomenon is a key prediction of special relativity and has been experimentally verified numerous times.\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are produced at the center of the detector and travel to the inner wall. The time it takes for them to travel the radius (R) of the detector is:\n    t = R / v\n    Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed (v) is approximately the speed of light (c). So, we can write:\n    t ≈ R / c\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Equation for Particle Survival\n\nBy combining the equations from Step 1, we can find the fraction of particles (N/N₀) that reach the detector wall:\n\nFraction surviving = N(t) / N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)\n\nSubstitute the expressions for t and τ_lab:\n\nFraction surviving = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ₀)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ₀))\n\n### Step 3: Use the Initial Conditions\n\nWe are given the following initial conditions:\n*   Detector radius, R = 30 m\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n*   Fraction of surviving particles = 1/3\n\nPlugging these values into our equation:\n\n1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * c * τ₀))\n\nTo solve for the unknown constant part (c * τ₀), we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ₀)\n-ln(3) = -1.5 / (c * τ₀)\nln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ₀)\n\nThis allows us to find the value of the term `1 / (c * τ₀)`:\n\n1 / (c * τ₀) = ln(3) / 1.5\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Required Lorentz Factor\n\nNow, we need to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂) that allows two-thirds (2/3) of the particles to reach the detector.\n\nThe new condition is:\n*   Fraction of surviving particles = 2/3\n*   Lorentz factor = γ₂\n\nUsing the same survival equation:\n\n2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀))\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n2/3 = exp((-30) * (1 / (c * τ₀)) / γ₂)\n\nNow, substitute the expression for `1 / (c * τ₀)` that we found in Step 3:\n\n2/3 = exp((-30) * (ln(3) / 1.5) / γ₂)\n2/3 = exp(-20 * ln(3) / γ₂)\n\nAgain, take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for γ₂:\n\nln(2/3) = -20 * ln(3) / γ₂\n-ln(3/2) = -20 * ln(3) / γ₂\nln(1.5) = 20 * ln(3) / γ₂\n\nFinally, rearrange the equation to solve for γ₂:\n\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055):\n\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709\nγ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully executed the plan to determine the new Lorentz factor.\n\nFirst, it established the relationship between the fraction of surviving particles (`f`) and the Lorentz factor (`γ`) as `f = exp(-K / γ)`, where `K` is a constant.

This is a standard model for particle decay.\n2.  **Time Dilation**: The lifetime of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is dilated in the laboratory frame. The lab-frame lifetime (τ_lab) is related to the proper lifetime (τ_proper) by the Lorentz factor γ, such that τ_lab = γ * τ_proper. This effect is well-documented and experimentally verified, for example, with muons traveling through the atmosphere.\n\nMy derivation combined these two principles.\n\nLet's re-state the relationship I derived:\nγ₂ = γ₁ * ln(1/P₁) / ln(1/P₂)\n\nWhere:\n- γ₁ = 20 (initial Lorentz factor)\n- P₁ = 1/3 (initial survival probability)\n- P₂ = 2/3 (target survival probability)\n- γ₂ = target Lorentz factor\n\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(1 / (1/3)) / ln(1 / (2/3))\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n\nThe calculation was:\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / (ln(3) - ln(2))\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / (1.0986 - 0.6931)\nγ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThe calculation is robust and based on well-established physics principles confirmed by the search results.

Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, v ≈ c, so t_flight ≈ R/c.\nThe lifetime in the lab frame t_lab is γτ, where τ is the proper lifetime.\nSo, P = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ)).\n\nTaking the natural logarithm:\nln(P) = -(R/c) / (γτ)\n-ln(P) * γ = (R/c) / τ\n\nSince R, c, and τ are constants for this particle and setup, the product -ln(P) * γ must be constant.\n-ln(P₁) * γ₁ = -ln(P₂) * γ₂\n-ln(1/3) * 20 = -ln(2/3) * γ₂\nln(3) * 20 = ln(3/2) * γ₂\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\nγ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThe logic holds up perfectly. The answer is C.The problem requires finding the new Lorentz factor (γ₂) that allows two-thirds of particles to reach a detector, given that at a Lorentz factor (γ₁) of ~20, only one-third reach it. This involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and the law of radioactive decay.\n\n### 1. Understanding Particle Decay and Time Dilation\nUnstable particles decay over time, following an exponential decay law. The number of particles N remaining at time t from an initial sample N₀ is given by:\nN(t) = N₀ * e^(-t / τ_lab)\n\nHere, τ_lab is the mean lifetime of the particles as measured in the laboratory frame.\n\nAccording to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time is relative. For a particle moving at a relativistic speed, its internal clock runs slower as observed from a stationary frame (the lab). This phenomenon is called time dilation. The lifetime of the particle in the lab frame (τ_lab) is related to its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, τ_proper) by the Lorentz factor, γ:\nτ_lab = γ * τ_proper\n\nThe Lorentz factor is defined as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²), where v is the particle's velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Equations\nThe fraction of particles that reach the detector is the survival probability, P = N(t) / N₀. The time t it takes for the particles to travel from the center to the detector wall (radius R = 30 m) is t = R / v. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity v is approximately the speed of light c.\nSo, t ≈ R / c.\n\nThe survival probability can be written as:\nP = e^(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))\n\n### 3. Using the Given Information\nWe are given two scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, P₁ = 1/3\n\nSubstituting these into our equation:\n1/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (20 * τ_proper))\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ_proper)\n-ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ_proper)\n20 * ln(3) = (R/c) / τ_proper\n\nThe term (R/c) / τ_proper is a constant that depends on the detector size and the type of particle.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, P₂ = 2/3\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂.\n\nThe equation for this scenario is:\n2/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ_proper))\n\nTaking the natural logarithm:\nln(2/3) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ_proper)\n-ln(3/2) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ_proper)\nγ₂ * ln(3/2) = (R/c) / τ_proper\n\n### 4. Solving for the New Lorentz Factor\nNow we have two expressions for the constant (R/c) / τ_proper. We can set them equal to each other:\nγ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)\n\nNow, we solve for γ₂:\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(2) ≈ 0.6931):\nln(3/2) = ln(3) - ln(2) ≈ 1.0986 - 0.6931 = 0.4055\n\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nProposer: The problem requires us to find the necessary Lorentz factor (γ) for a specific fraction of particles to survive and reach a detector wall. This can be solved by using the relativistic particle decay formula.\n\nMy proposed solution is as follows:\n1.  Define the survival fraction of particles using the exponential decay law, incorporating time dilation. The number of particles N at a time t in the lab frame is given by N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / (γ * τ)), where N₀ is the initial number, τ is the proper lifetime, and γ is the Lorentz factor.\n2.  The time `t` for a particle to travel the detector radius `R` is `t = R/v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, we can approximate their velocity `v` as the speed of light `c`, so `t ≈ R/c`.\n3.  Set up two equations based on the two scenarios given:\n    *   Scenario 1: γ₁ = 20, and the survival fraction N/N₀ = 1/3. This gives: 1/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (20 * τ)).\n    *   Scenario 2: γ₂ is unknown, and the survival fraction N/N₀ = 2/3. This gives: 2/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ)).\n4.  Solve these two equations to find γ₂. By taking the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation and then taking their ratio, the unknown terms `R/c` and `τ` will cancel out, allowing for a direct calculation of γ₂.\n\nMy proposed action is to perform a search to get the precise values of the natural logarithms needed for the calculation.\n\nSkeptic: The proposed path is logical. The use of the relativistic decay formula is appropriate, and the method of solving the two simultaneous equations by taking their ratio is efficient as it eliminates the unknown proper lifetime (τ) and the `R/c` term. The search results provide the necessary high-precision values for the natural logarithms.\n\nLet's verify the calculation with the retrieved values.\n*   From the search results, ln(3) ≈ 1.09861228867.\n*   From the search results, ln(2) ≈ 0.693147.\n*   We need to calculate ln(3/2), which is ln(3) - ln(2).\n    *   ln(3/2) ≈ 1.09861228867 - 0.69314718056 = 0.40546510811\n*   The formula for the new Lorentz factor is γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2)).\n    *   γ₂ = 20 * (1.09861228867 / 0.40546510811)\n    *   γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.70951129\n    *   γ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThe calculation is correct.
