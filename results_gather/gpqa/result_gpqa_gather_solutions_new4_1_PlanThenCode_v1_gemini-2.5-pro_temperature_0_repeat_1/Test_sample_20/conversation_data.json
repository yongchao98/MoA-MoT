  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nCompounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).\n\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a phenomenon where a single chemical compound tends to exist in two or more interconvertible structures that are different in terms of the relative position of one atomic nucleus, which is generally hydrogen. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it typically must have an α-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** The structure of p-benzoquinone consists of a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. There are no α-hydrogens on saturated carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups. While there are hydrogens on the double-bonded carbons (vinylic hydrogens), their removal to form a tautomer is energetically unfavorable. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbon atoms between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) each have α-hydrogens. This allows it to undergo keto-enol tautomerism to form its enol tautomer, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This enol form is particularly stable because it is aromatic.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The IUPAC name for this compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). This makes the second carbon a chiral center, and thus, the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The IUPAC name for this compound is dimethyl (E)-but-2-enedioate. It is the trans-isomer of a butenedioate ester. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, which means it is achiral. Since it is not chiral, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining the findings from both parts, the correct option is:\nA = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two isomers that can be interconverted, most commonly by the migration of a proton. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n1.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   Its structure consists of a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   These CH₂ groups are alpha to the carbonyl groups. For example, the carbon at position 2 is alpha to the carbonyls at positions 1 and 3.\n    *   Since there are hydrogen atoms on these alpha-carbons, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   In fact, it tautomerizes to form phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic and highly stable compound. The equilibrium strongly favors this aromatic enol form.\n    *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups opposite each other.\n    *   The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds (they are sp² hybridized).\n    *   For standard keto-enol tautomerism, an alpha-hydrogen on an sp³ hybridized carbon is typically required. Benzoquinone lacks such a carbon.\n    *   While it can be converted to hydroquinone, this is a reduction reaction (gain of two electrons and two protons), not a simple intramolecular proton shift (tautomerization).\n    *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.\n\n**Optical isomerism** is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2, the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral.\n    *   Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This is the *trans* isomer of an alkene with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond.\n    *   It possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   Any molecule with a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this with the options provided:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Part 1: Identifying Compound (A) - Tautomerism**\n\n**Concept:** Tautomerism is a type of constitutional isomerism where two isomers, called tautomers, are in equilibrium and can be readily interconverted. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must satisfy two key conditions:\n1.  It must have a carbonyl group (keto form).\n2.  It must have at least one hydrogen atom on the adjacent carbon (the α-carbon). This α-hydrogen must be on an sp³ hybridized carbon for typical tautomerism to occur.\n3.  The keto and enol forms must have the same molecular formula.\n\n**Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n*   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two ketone (C=O) groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4) and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). Its molecular formula is C₆H₄O₂.\n*   **α-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n*   **α-Hydrogens:** Each of these α-carbons is part of a C=C double bond (sp² hybridized) and is bonded to one hydrogen atom.\n*   **Tautomerization Check:** If benzoquinone were to tautomerize, it would form hydroquinone (benzene-1,4-diol). The molecular formula of hydroquinone is C₆H₆O₂. Since the molecular formulas of benzoquinone (C₆H₄O₂) and hydroquinone (C₆H₆O₂) are different, they are not isomers. The conversion between them is a reduction/oxidation reaction, not tautomerism. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.**\n\n**Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n*   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups. Its molecular formula is C₆H₆O₃.\n*   **α-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all α-carbons to two different carbonyl groups.\n*   **α-Hydrogens:** These α-carbons are sp³ hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Tautomerization Check:** Since there are α-hydrogens on sp³ carbons, it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. It can tautomerize to form its enol form, phloroglucinol (benzene-1,3,5-triol). The molecular formula of phloroglucinol is C₆H₆O₃, which is the same as the keto form. This enol form is highly stable because it is an aromatic compound. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.**\n\n**Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Part 2: Identifying Compound (B) - Optical Isomerism**\n\n**Concept:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reason for chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n**Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Chiral Center Check:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will show optical isomerism.**\n\n**Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**\n*   **Structure:** This is the trans-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Chiral Center Check:** There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The two central carbons are sp² hybridized.\n*   **Symmetry Check:** The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) as well as a center of inversion. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule, it **will not show optical isomerism.** (Note: It does show geometric isomerism).\n\n**Conclusion for (B):** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer Determination**\n\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this with the given options:\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\n**Concept:** Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two isomers that can be interconverted, most commonly by the migration of a proton. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one **alpha-hydrogen**. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom adjacent (in the alpha position) to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**Analysis of the compounds:**\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds inside the ring and two carbonyl groups (C=O) at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4).\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are the carbons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These alpha-carbons are part of the ring's double bonds (C=C). To satisfy the valency of four, these carbons are bonded to another carbon in the ring (via a single bond), another carbon in the ring (via a double bond), and the carbonyl carbon. They do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered saturated ring with three carbonyl groups (C=O) at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups. For example, the carbon at position 2 is alpha to the carbonyls at C1 and C3.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these alpha-carbons (C2, C4, C6) is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerism. It tautomerizes to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and highly stable compound.\n\n**Result for Part 1:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. Therefore, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism (B)**\n\n**Concept:** Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is **chiral**, meaning its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a **chiral center** (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n**Analysis of the compounds:**\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n    *   **Analysis of Chiral Center:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group.\n        *   Group 1: A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        *   Group 2: A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        *   Group 3: A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        *   Group 4: A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since this carbon atom is bonded to four distinctly different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is chiral and will exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis of Chiral Center:** The molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond. The carbons of the double bond are each bonded to only three groups (not four), so they cannot be chiral centers. The carbons in the methyl groups are bonded to three identical hydrogen atoms. The carbonyl carbons are double-bonded to oxygen. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule has no chiral center. It is also a planar molecule with a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Result for Part 2:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. Therefore, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structural isomers, called tautomers, are in dynamic equilibrium and can be easily interconverted. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom that is adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring containing two carbon-carbon double bonds and two carbonyl groups opposite each other.\n    *   Let's identify the alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the C=O groups). The carbons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 4.\n    *   However, these alpha-carbons are part of the C=C double bonds within the ring. They are sp² hybridized and are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   These methylene groups are located between two carbonyl groups, making their hydrogen atoms (alpha-hydrogens) particularly acidic.\n    *   The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its enol form.\n    *   The enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound. Due to the high stability of the aromatic ring, the equilibrium heavily favors the enol form.\n    *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, A = benzoquinone.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group). This carbon is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center.\n    *   The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, meaning it will have a non-superimposable mirror image (an enantiomer).\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   The structure is the trans-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond, which restricts rotation.\n    *   Let's check for elements of symmetry. The molecule has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   Alternatively, the molecule is essentially planar and possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the entire molecule.\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, it is superimposable on its mirror image and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n**Final Combination:**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n*   **Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible constitutional isomers, known as tautomers. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl (C=O) groups at opposite positions (1 and 4). The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has three carbonyl groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons to these carbonyl groups, and each of these carbons has two hydrogen atoms. These alpha-hydrogens are acidic and can participate in tautomerization. In fact, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exists almost entirely in its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), because this form is aromatic and thus exceptionally stable. Therefore, it exhibits tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Its chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group. The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n        Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral. It will exist as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms) and thus exhibits optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups in a *trans* configuration across the double bond. The molecule is planar around the C=C double bond and possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry). Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is benzoquinone.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n    *   This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n*   **Part A (Tautomerism):** Analyze benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione for their ability to undergo tautomerism. Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, requires an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n*   **Part B (Optical Isomerism):** Analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate for optical isomerism. This requires identifying the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n*   **Conclusion:** Combine the findings from Part A and Part B to select the correct option.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Tautomerism**\n\nI will start by examining the structures of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione to determine which one cannot undergo tautomerism.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at opposite positions (1 and 4) and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Without alpha-hydrogens, keto-enol tautomerism cannot occur.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This is a saturated six-membered ring with three C=O groups. The carbons between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups. These carbons are alpha to the carbonyls and possess alpha-hydrogens. These hydrogens can be removed to form an enol. In fact, this compound exists in equilibrium with its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n\nTherefore, the compound that does **not** show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Optical Isomerism**\n\nNow I will examine the structures of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate to determine which one exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's analyze the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a chiral center are optically active (unless they are a meso compound, which is not the case here). Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is an alkene with a trans configuration around the double bond. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there is no chiral center. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\nTherefore, the compound that **will** show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nCombining the results:\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTo determine which compound does not exhibit tautomerism, we must look for the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** In the structure of p-benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of a double bond within the ring and do not have any alpha-hydrogens available for tautomerization. Attempting to form a tautomer would result in a highly unstable structure with cumulated double bonds within the ring. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has methylene groups (-CH2-) located between the carbonyl groups. These are alpha-carbons, and they possess alpha-hydrogens. This allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is aromatic and particularly stable.\n\nThus, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The central carbon atom (C2) in this molecule is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). Because it has a chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exhibits optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of an alkene. It has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral. It does not contain any chiral centers. While it is a stereoisomer of dimethyl maleate (a geometric isomer), it does not have a non-superimposable mirror image and thus does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining these findings, A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n### Analysis of the Compounds\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two isomers that can readily interconvert. A common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which typically requires a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** In p-benzoquinone, the carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) groups are part of a double bond system within the ring. These carbons are sp² hybridized and do not have the necessary alpha-hydrogens on a saturated carbon that readily participate in tautomerism. While they have hydrogens, their removal to form a tautomer is energetically highly unfavorable as it would disrupt the conjugated system and create an unstable structure. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has methylene groups (-CH₂-) located between the carbonyl groups. The hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens and are particularly acidic because they are adjacent to two carbonyl groups. This allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerization to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is exceptionally stable because it is aromatic, meaning the equilibrium heavily favors the enol form. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of a chiral molecule is a chiral center, typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure of this molecule is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Because this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (R and S forms).\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* configuration across the carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule does not contain any chiral centers. It possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, which makes it an achiral molecule. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on the analysis of the compounds:\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it generally requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom on a saturated (sp³ hybridized) carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. In benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of a double bond (sp² hybridized). While these carbons have hydrogen atoms, their removal is energetically unfavorable as it would lead to a highly unstable ring structure. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has methylene groups (-CH₂-) located between the carbonyl groups. These are saturated carbons containing alpha-hydrogens. This allows it to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n\nThus, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center, and the molecule exhibits optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* configuration. The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nThus, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining these findings, A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the correct option, we must analyze the tautomerism of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, and the optical isomerism of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two isomers that readily interconvert. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone**: The structure of p-benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups within a six-membered ring containing two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of these double bonds (sp² hybridized) and do not have the required alpha-hydrogens on a saturated carbon. While hydrogens are present on the ring, their migration would lead to a highly unstable structure. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups and alpha-hydrogens on the carbon atoms situated between them. It can undergo keto-enol tautomerism to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is particularly stable because it is aromatic, which strongly favors the tautomerization process.\n\nThus, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center, typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (at position 2) that is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This carbon is a chiral center, meaning the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (L and D forms).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate**: This is the methyl ester of fumaric acid, with the chemical name dimethyl (E)-but-2-enedioate. It is a planar molecule with a carbon-carbon double bond in the *trans* configuration. It does not contain any chiral centers and possesses a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is not a chiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nThus, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe code successfully analyzed the properties of the four compounds.\n\nFor the first part (A), it determined that tautomerism requires alpha-hydrogens. Benzoquinone lacks these hydrogens, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione possesses them. Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is benzoquinone.\n\nFor the second part (B), it determined that optical isomerism requires a chiral center. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a carbon atom bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, -CH3, and -COOCH3), making it chiral. Dimethyl fumarate is achiral. Therefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nThe final result is A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\n**Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione vs. Benzoquinone**\n\nTautomerism is a type of isomerism where isomers can interconvert by a chemical reaction. In keto-enol tautomerism, a molecule containing a carbonyl group (a ketone) is in equilibrium with its enol form (an alcohol adjacent to a double bond). A key requirement for this to occur is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups. The carbon atoms between these groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons, and they each have hydrogen atoms. These alpha-hydrogens allow the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily shows tautomerism.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the ketone groups are part of these double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Without alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\n**Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate vs. Dimethyl fumarate**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. The most common feature leading to chirality is a chiral center, typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  an ester group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the arrangement around the central carbon-carbon double bond is trans. The molecule does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups, so it has no chiral center. The molecule possesses a center of symmetry and is therefore achiral, meaning it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\n**Proposer:** My initial approach is to solve this problem in two parts, as presented in the question. First, I will determine which of the two compounds, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does not exhibit tautomerism. Second, I will identify which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism. To do this, I need to examine the molecular structures of these compounds. I will start by searching for information on the tautomerism of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n\n**Skeptic:** This is a reasonable starting point. However, the key to tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom relative to a carbonyl group. A simple structural analysis might be sufficient, but a search is a good way to confirm our understanding and check for any exceptions or special cases. For instance, the stability of the resulting enol form can be a deciding factor. Let's ensure the search is targeted to find out if these specific compounds can or cannot tautomerize.\n\n**Decided Action:** I will execute a search to determine the tautomeric properties of both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.**Proposer:** The initial search has provided information on all four compounds. I will now analyze the results for each part of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Skeptic:** The search results seem comprehensive. Let's proceed with the analysis. For Part A, we need to be certain about which compound lacks the ability to tautomerize. For Part B, we must confirm the presence of a chiral center in one compound and its absence in the other.\n\n**Proposer:**\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** The search results indicate that benzoquinone does not show tautomerism. This is because its structure lacks alpha-hydrogens, which are necessary for the most common form of keto-enol tautomerism. Any theoretical tautomer would be highly unstable.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound does exhibit tautomerism. Its enol form, known as phloroglucinol, is an aromatic compound (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This aromaticity provides significant stabilization, making the enol form more stable than the keto form.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Proposer:**\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure of this compound is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This makes it a chiral center. Compounds with a chiral center are optically active. Several sources confirm its chirality by referring to its specific enantiomers, (R) and (S) forms. In fact, it is described as the simplest chiral ester.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This compound has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, and is the trans-isomer. It does not contain any chiral centers. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and not optically active.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Skeptic:** The analysis is sound. Compound A is benzoquinone, and Compound B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. This combination matches one of the provided options. The debate is converged.\n\n**Proposer:** Based on the analysis:\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it typically must have an α-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** The structure of p-benzoquinone consists of a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. There are no α-hydrogens on saturated carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups. While there are hydrogens on the double-bonded carbons (vinylic hydrogens), their removal to form a tautomer is energetically unfavorable. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbon atoms between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) each have α-hydrogens. This allows it to undergo keto-enol tautomerism to form its enol tautomer, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This enol form is particularly stable because it is aromatic.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The IUPAC name for this compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). This makes the second carbon a chiral center, and thus, the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The IUPAC name for this compound is dimethyl (E)-but-2-enedioate. It is the trans-isomer of a butenedioate ester. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, which means it is achiral. Since it is not chiral, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining the findings from both parts, the correct option is:\nA = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two isomers that can be interconverted, most commonly by the migration of a proton. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n1.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   Its structure consists of a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   These CH₂ groups are alpha to the carbonyl groups. For example, the carbon at position 2 is alpha to the carbonyls at positions 1 and 3.\n    *   Since there are hydrogen atoms on these alpha-carbons, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   In fact, it tautomerizes to form phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic and highly stable compound. The equilibrium strongly favors this aromatic enol form.\n    *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups opposite each other.\n    *   The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds (they are sp² hybridized).\n    *   For standard keto-enol tautomerism, an alpha-hydrogen on an sp³ hybridized carbon is typically required. Benzoquinone lacks such a carbon.\n    *   While it can be converted to hydroquinone, this is a reduction reaction (gain of two electrons and two protons), not a simple intramolecular proton shift (tautomerization).\n    *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.\n\n**Optical isomerism** is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2, the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral.\n    *   Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This is the *trans* isomer of an alkene with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond.\n    *   It possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   Any molecule with a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this with the options provided:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Part 1: Identifying Compound (A) - Tautomerism**\n\n**Concept:** Tautomerism is a type of constitutional isomerism where two isomers, called tautomers, are in equilibrium and can be readily interconverted. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must satisfy two key conditions:\n1.  It must have a carbonyl group (keto form).\n2.  It must have at least one hydrogen atom on the adjacent carbon (the α-carbon). This α-hydrogen must be on an sp³ hybridized carbon for typical tautomerism to occur.\n3.  The keto and enol forms must have the same molecular formula.\n\n**Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n*   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two ketone (C=O) groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4) and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). Its molecular formula is C₆H₄O₂.\n*   **α-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n*   **α-Hydrogens:** Each of these α-carbons is part of a C=C double bond (sp² hybridized) and is bonded to one hydrogen atom.\n*   **Tautomerization Check:** If benzoquinone were to tautomerize, it would form hydroquinone (benzene-1,4-diol). The molecular formula of hydroquinone is C₆H₆O₂. Since the molecular formulas of benzoquinone (C₆H₄O₂) and hydroquinone (C₆H₆O₂) are different, they are not isomers. The conversion between them is a reduction/oxidation reaction, not tautomerism. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.**\n\n**Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n*   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups. Its molecular formula is C₆H₆O₃.\n*   **α-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all α-carbons to two different carbonyl groups.\n*   **α-Hydrogens:** These α-carbons are sp³ hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Tautomerization Check:** Since there are α-hydrogens on sp³ carbons, it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. It can tautomerize to form its enol form, phloroglucinol (benzene-1,3,5-triol). The molecular formula of phloroglucinol is C₆H₆O₃, which is the same as the keto form. This enol form is highly stable because it is an aromatic compound. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.**\n\n**Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Part 2: Identifying Compound (B) - Optical Isomerism**\n\n**Concept:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reason for chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n**Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Chiral Center Check:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will show optical isomerism.**\n\n**Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**\n*   **Structure:** This is the trans-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Chiral Center Check:** There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The two central carbons are sp² hybridized.\n*   **Symmetry Check:** The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) as well as a center of inversion. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule, it **will not show optical isomerism.** (Note: It does show geometric isomerism).\n\n**Conclusion for (B):** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer Determination**\n\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this with the given options:\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\n**Concept:** Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two isomers that can be interconverted, most commonly by the migration of a proton. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one **alpha-hydrogen**. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom adjacent (in the alpha position) to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**Analysis of the compounds:**\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds inside the ring and two carbonyl groups (C=O) at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4).\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are the carbons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These alpha-carbons are part of the ring's double bonds (C=C). To satisfy the valency of four, these carbons are bonded to another carbon in the ring (via a single bond), another carbon in the ring (via a double bond), and the carbonyl carbon. They do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered saturated ring with three carbonyl groups (C=O) at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups. For example, the carbon at position 2 is alpha to the carbonyls at C1 and C3.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these alpha-carbons (C2, C4, C6) is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerism. It tautomerizes to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and highly stable compound.\n\n**Result for Part 1:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. Therefore, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism (B)**\n\n**Concept:** Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is **chiral**, meaning its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a **chiral center** (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n**Analysis of the compounds:**\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n    *   **Analysis of Chiral Center:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group.\n        *   Group 1: A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        *   Group 2: A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        *   Group 3: A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        *   Group 4: A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since this carbon atom is bonded to four distinctly different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is chiral and will exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis of Chiral Center:** The molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond. The carbons of the double bond are each bonded to only three groups (not four), so they cannot be chiral centers. The carbons in the methyl groups are bonded to three identical hydrogen atoms. The carbonyl carbons are double-bonded to oxygen. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule has no chiral center. It is also a planar molecule with a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Result for Part 2:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. Therefore, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structural isomers, called tautomers, are in dynamic equilibrium and can be easily interconverted. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom that is adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring containing two carbon-carbon double bonds and two carbonyl groups opposite each other.\n    *   Let's identify the alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the C=O groups). The carbons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 4.\n    *   However, these alpha-carbons are part of the C=C double bonds within the ring. They are sp² hybridized and are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   These methylene groups are located between two carbonyl groups, making their hydrogen atoms (alpha-hydrogens) particularly acidic.\n    *   The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its enol form.\n    *   The enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound. Due to the high stability of the aromatic ring, the equilibrium heavily favors the enol form.\n    *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, A = benzoquinone.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group). This carbon is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center.\n    *   The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, meaning it will have a non-superimposable mirror image (an enantiomer).\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   The structure is the trans-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond, which restricts rotation.\n    *   Let's check for elements of symmetry. The molecule has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   Alternatively, the molecule is essentially planar and possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the entire molecule.\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, it is superimposable on its mirror image and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n**Final Combination:**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n*   **Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible constitutional isomers, known as tautomers. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl (C=O) groups at opposite positions (1 and 4). The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has three carbonyl groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons to these carbonyl groups, and each of these carbons has two hydrogen atoms. These alpha-hydrogens are acidic and can participate in tautomerization. In fact, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exists almost entirely in its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), because this form is aromatic and thus exceptionally stable. Therefore, it exhibits tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Its chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group. The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n        Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral. It will exist as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms) and thus exhibits optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups in a *trans* configuration across the double bond. The molecule is planar around the C=C double bond and possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry). Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is benzoquinone.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n    *   This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n*   **Part A (Tautomerism):** Analyze benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione for their ability to undergo tautomerism. Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, requires an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n*   **Part B (Optical Isomerism):** Analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate for optical isomerism. This requires identifying the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n*   **Conclusion:** Combine the findings from Part A and Part B to select the correct option.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Tautomerism**\n\nI will start by examining the structures of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione to determine which one cannot undergo tautomerism.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at opposite positions (1 and 4) and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Without alpha-hydrogens, keto-enol tautomerism cannot occur.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This is a saturated six-membered ring with three C=O groups. The carbons between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups. These carbons are alpha to the carbonyls and possess alpha-hydrogens. These hydrogens can be removed to form an enol. In fact, this compound exists in equilibrium with its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n\nTherefore, the compound that does **not** show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Optical Isomerism**\n\nNow I will examine the structures of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate to determine which one exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's analyze the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a chiral center are optically active (unless they are a meso compound, which is not the case here). Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is an alkene with a trans configuration around the double bond. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there is no chiral center. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\nTherefore, the compound that **will** show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nCombining the results:\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTo determine which compound does not exhibit tautomerism, we must look for the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** In the structure of p-benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of a double bond within the ring and do not have any alpha-hydrogens available for tautomerization. Attempting to form a tautomer would result in a highly unstable structure with cumulated double bonds within the ring. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has methylene groups (-CH2-) located between the carbonyl groups. These are alpha-carbons, and they possess alpha-hydrogens. This allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is aromatic and particularly stable.\n\nThus, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The central carbon atom (C2) in this molecule is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). Because it has a chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exhibits optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of an alkene. It has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral. It does not contain any chiral centers. While it is a stereoisomer of dimethyl maleate (a geometric isomer), it does not have a non-superimposable mirror image and thus does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining these findings, A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n### Analysis of the Compounds\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two isomers that can readily interconvert. A common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which typically requires a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** In p-benzoquinone, the carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) groups are part of a double bond system within the ring. These carbons are sp² hybridized and do not have the necessary alpha-hydrogens on a saturated carbon that readily participate in tautomerism. While they have hydrogens, their removal to form a tautomer is energetically highly unfavorable as it would disrupt the conjugated system and create an unstable structure. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has methylene groups (-CH₂-) located between the carbonyl groups. The hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens and are particularly acidic because they are adjacent to two carbonyl groups. This allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerization to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is exceptionally stable because it is aromatic, meaning the equilibrium heavily favors the enol form. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of a chiral molecule is a chiral center, typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure of this molecule is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Because this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (R and S forms).\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* configuration across the carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule does not contain any chiral centers. It possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, which makes it an achiral molecule. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on the analysis of the compounds:\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it generally requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom on a saturated (sp³ hybridized) carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. In benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of a double bond (sp² hybridized). While these carbons have hydrogen atoms, their removal is energetically unfavorable as it would lead to a highly unstable ring structure. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has methylene groups (-CH₂-) located between the carbonyl groups. These are saturated carbons containing alpha-hydrogens. This allows it to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n\nThus, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center, and the molecule exhibits optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* configuration. The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nThus, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining these findings, A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the correct option, we must analyze the tautomerism of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, and the optical isomerism of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two isomers that readily interconvert. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone**: The structure of p-benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups within a six-membered ring containing two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of these double bonds (sp² hybridized) and do not have the required alpha-hydrogens on a saturated carbon. While hydrogens are present on the ring, their migration would lead to a highly unstable structure. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups and alpha-hydrogens on the carbon atoms situated between them. It can undergo keto-enol tautomerism to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is particularly stable because it is aromatic, which strongly favors the tautomerization process.\n\nThus, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center, typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (at position 2) that is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This carbon is a chiral center, meaning the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (L and D forms).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate**: This is the methyl ester of fumaric acid, with the chemical name dimethyl (E)-but-2-enedioate. It is a planar molecule with a carbon-carbon double bond in the *trans* configuration. It does not contain any chiral centers and possesses a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is not a chiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nThus, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe code successfully analyzed the properties of the four compounds.\n\nFor the first part (A), it determined that tautomerism requires alpha-hydrogens. Benzoquinone lacks these hydrogens, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione possesses them. Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is benzoquinone.\n\nFor the second part (B), it determined that optical isomerism requires a chiral center. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a carbon atom bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, -CH3, and -COOCH3), making it chiral. Dimethyl fumarate is achiral. Therefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nThe final result is A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\n**Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione vs. Benzoquinone**\n\nTautomerism is a type of isomerism where isomers can interconvert by a chemical reaction. In keto-enol tautomerism, a molecule containing a carbonyl group (a ketone) is in equilibrium with its enol form (an alcohol adjacent to a double bond). A key requirement for this to occur is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups. The carbon atoms between these groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons, and they each have hydrogen atoms. These alpha-hydrogens allow the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily shows tautomerism.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the ketone groups are part of these double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Without alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\n**Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate vs. Dimethyl fumarate**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. The most common feature leading to chirality is a chiral center, typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  an ester group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the arrangement around the central carbon-carbon double bond is trans. The molecule does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups, so it has no chiral center. The molecule possesses a center of symmetry and is therefore achiral, meaning it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\n**Proposer:** My initial approach is to solve this problem in two parts, as presented in the question. First, I will determine which of the two compounds, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does not exhibit tautomerism. Second, I will identify which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism. To do this, I need to examine the molecular structures of these compounds. I will start by searching for information on the tautomerism of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n\n**Skeptic:** This is a reasonable starting point. However, the key to tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom relative to a carbonyl group. A simple structural analysis might be sufficient, but a search is a good way to confirm our understanding and check for any exceptions or special cases. For instance, the stability of the resulting enol form can be a deciding factor. Let's ensure the search is targeted to find out if these specific compounds can or cannot tautomerize.\n\n**Decided Action:** I will execute a search to determine the tautomeric properties of both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.**Proposer:** The initial search has provided information on all four compounds. I will now analyze the results for each part of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Skeptic:** The search results seem comprehensive. Let's proceed with the analysis. For Part A, we need to be certain about which compound lacks the ability to tautomerize. For Part B, we must confirm the presence of a chiral center in one compound and its absence in the other.\n\n**Proposer:**\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** The search results indicate that benzoquinone does not show tautomerism. This is because its structure lacks alpha-hydrogens, which are necessary for the most common form of keto-enol tautomerism. Any theoretical tautomer would be highly unstable.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound does exhibit tautomerism. Its enol form, known as phloroglucinol, is an aromatic compound (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This aromaticity provides significant stabilization, making the enol form more stable than the keto form.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Proposer:**\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure of this compound is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This makes it a chiral center. Compounds with a chiral center are optically active. Several sources confirm its chirality by referring to its specific enantiomers, (R) and (S) forms. In fact, it is described as the simplest chiral ester.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This compound has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, and is the trans-isomer. It does not contain any chiral centers. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and not optically active.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Skeptic:** The analysis is sound. Compound A is benzoquinone, and Compound B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. This combination matches one of the provided options. The debate is converged.\n\n**Proposer:** Based on the analysis:\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",
