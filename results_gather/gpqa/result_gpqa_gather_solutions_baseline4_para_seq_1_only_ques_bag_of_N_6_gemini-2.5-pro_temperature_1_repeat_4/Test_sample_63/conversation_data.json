Deconstruction of the Experimental Setup**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gas mixture is analyzed by passing it through a series of reactive tubes. Let's analyze the function of each tube to identify the products of the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent. Its mass increase is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O absorbed = 3.60 g.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change. This is a crucial piece of information: it tells us that **no acidic gases were formed** during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper, Cu):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, which means the gas contained oxygen atoms. The mass increase of the tube corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of oxygen atoms (O) gained = 0.80 g.\n    *   The molar mass of an oxygen atom is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen most likely came from O₂ gas (in which case moles of O₂ = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol) or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** The gas that did not react in any of the tubes.\n    *   Volume of gas C = 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since this gas is inert to a strong dehydrating agent, a base, and hot copper, it is almost certainly nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Determining the Composition of the Salts**\n\nFrom the products (H₂O, N₂, and an oxygen source), we can deduce that the original salts A and B must be composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). Let's calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the 0.10 mol of N₂. Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and in the gas that reacted with copper. Moles of O = (moles in H₂O) + (moles reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet's check if the mass of these elements adds up to the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 + 2.80 + 4.00 = 7.20 g.\nThe calculated mass matches the given mass, confirming our analysis.\n\n**3. Identifying Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. Common salts with these elements are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids, such as ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains an equal number of moles ('n') of salt A and salt B.\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the salts are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃.\n*   Salt A: NH₄NO₂ (contains 2 N, 4 H, 2 O)\n*   Salt B: NH₄NO₃ (contains 2 N, 4 H, 3 O)\n\nLet's check if the total elemental moles match our findings for an equimolar mixture of these two salts.\n*   Total moles of H = n × (4) + n × (4) = 8n. We found 0.40 mol of H. So, 8n = 0.40  => n = 0.05 mol.\n*   Total moles of N = n × (2) + n × (2) = 4n. We found 0.20 mol of N. So, 4n = 0.20  => n = 0.05 mol.\n*   Total moles of O = n × (2) + n × (3) = 5n. We found 0.25 mol of O. So, 5n = 0.25  => n = 0.05 mol.\n\nAll calculations consistently give n = 0.05 mol. This confirms that the equimolar mixture consists of 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrite and 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrate.\n\nThe decomposition reactions that produce the observed products are:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n**4. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two identified salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental data from the gas treatment.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, etc. The fact that its weight did not change means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition of the salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is equal to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen must have come from an oxygen-containing gas that is not H₂O (removed in tube 1) and not acidic (did not react in tube 2). Plausible candidates are O₂ or a neutral oxide of nitrogen like N₂O.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, an alkaline solution, or hot copper. This strongly suggests it is a non-reactive gas, most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B decomposed entirely into the gas mixture. By the law of conservation of mass, the mass and elemental composition of the salts must equal the mass and elemental composition of the gaseous products.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.2 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.4 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O reacted with Cu) = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen, as the products (H₂O, N₂, and an oxygen source like N₂O or O₂) are composed only of H, O, and N.\n    *   Mass of N = Total mass - Mass of H - Mass of O = 7.20 g - 0.4 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n**3. Identify the chemical formulas of salts A and B.**\n\nWe have the total elemental molar content of the equimolar mixture of A and B: N(0.2 mol), H(0.4 mol), O(0.25 mol).\nLet's find the ratio of atoms in the combined formula (A + B):\nN : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\nSo, the combined empirical formula for an equimolar amount of A and B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe problem states A and B are salts. The presence of N, H, and O, and the decomposition into gases suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen acids.\n*   The ammonium ion is NH₄⁺.\n*   Common nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n\nWe need to partition the total formula N₄H₈O₅ into two salt formulas, A and B, which are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\nSince we need a total of 8 hydrogen atoms, and the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺) has 4, it is logical to assume each salt contains one ammonium ion.\n*   Salt A = NH₄⁺X⁻\n*   Salt B = NH₄⁺Y⁻\n\nThis accounts for N₂H₈ in total. The remaining atoms to be distributed between the anions X⁻ and Y⁻ are:\nN₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅\nSo, the combined formula of the two anions is X⁻ + Y⁻ = N₂O₅.\nThe most logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable anions is:\n*   Anion X⁻ = NO₃⁻\n*   Anion Y⁻ = NO₂⁻\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃** (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂** (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\nLet's check if the sum of their formulas matches our derived total: N₂H₄O₃ + N₂H₄O₂ = N₄H₈O₅. It matches perfectly.\n\n*(Self-consistency check: The decomposition of 1 mole of NH₄NO₂ gives N₂ + 2H₂O. The decomposition of 1 mole of NH₄NO₃ at ~200°C gives N₂O + 2H₂O. An equimolar mixture would produce N₂, N₂O, and H₂O. N₂O would be the gas that oxidizes the hot copper, and N₂ would be the final inert gas C. This is fully consistent with our analysis.)*\n\n**4. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This is interpreted as the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe total number of atoms is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the reaction and identify the products.**\n\n*   An equimolar mixture of salts A and B (total mass = 7.20 g) is heated and decomposes completely into a gas mixture. This means no solid residue is left.\n*   The gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes:\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong desiccant that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The mass of the tube did not change, which means **no CO₂ was produced**. This implies the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot Copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of O₂ that reacted.\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all these steps, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n\n**2. Calculate the moles of each product.**\n\n*   **Moles of H₂O:**\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol H₂O\n\n*   **Moles of O₂:**\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol O₂\n\n*   **Moles and identity of Gas C:**\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol Gas C.\n    *   We can find the mass of Gas C by the law of conservation of mass:\n        *   Mass of Gas C = Total initial mass - Mass of H₂O - Mass of O₂\n        *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g\n    *   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n        *   Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A diatomic gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂). This makes sense, as many nitrogen-containing salts decompose to produce N₂ gas.\n\nSo, the decomposition products are: **0.20 mol H₂O**, **0.025 mol O₂**, and **0.10 mol N₂**.\n\n**3. Determine the composition of the original salts.**\n\nThe salts A and B must contain the elements found in the products: Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N).\n\nLet's find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of H:** 0.20 mol H₂O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) = 0.40 mol H\n*   **Moles of N:** 0.10 mol N₂ × (2 mol N / 1 mol N₂) = 0.20 mol N\n*   **Moles of O:** (0.20 mol H₂O × 1) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nWe are looking for two salts (A and B) containing H, N, and O that decompose on heating to give H₂O, O₂, and N₂. Ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids are likely candidates. Let's consider:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂): Decomposes as NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃): At higher temperatures (~250-300°C), it can decompose as 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the mixture consists of **NH₄NO₂ (Salt A)** and **NH₄NO₃ (Salt B)**. Since the mixture is equimolar, let's say it contains 'n' moles of each salt.\n\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: `n` mol N₂ and `2n` mol H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: `n` mol N₂ + `0.5n` mol O₂ + `2n` mol H₂O.\n\nTotal moles of products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n*   Total O₂ = 0.5n\n\nNow, let's compare this with our experimental results:\n*   Total O₂ = 0.5n = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Total N₂ = 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches the experiment)\n*   Total H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol (Matches the experiment)\n\nThe hypothesis is correct. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**5. Verify the total mass.**\n\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.2 g + 4.0 g = 7.20 g (Matches the initial mass)\n\n**6. Calculate the final answer.**\n\nThe question asks for the **total number of all atoms in salts A and B** (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Absorption Data**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze what each tube tells us:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect and absorb acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   Mass increase = 0 g.\n    *   This is a crucial piece of information: no acidic gases were produced. This rules out salts containing carbonate (CO₃²⁻) or organic anions that would decompose to CO₂.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂).\n    *   The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in the tube's weight is due to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass increase = mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all these steps, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify the Gaseous Products and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nThe decomposition of the salt mixture produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol of Gas C\n\nThe original salts are heated \"without air\". The products must come from the elements within the salts. The gases H₂O and O₂ are composed of H and O. What could Gas C be? Given that it passed through all the tubes without reacting, it must be a relatively inert gas. The most common inert gas produced from heating nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\nLet's assume Gas C is N₂ and check if the law of conservation of mass holds.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = moles × molar mass = 0.10 mol × 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis total mass exactly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). This confirms that our identification of the products (H₂O, O₂, and N₂) and their quantities is correct.\n\n**3. Determine the Empirical Formula of the Mixture**\n\nNow we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Moles H = 2 × moles H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Moles N = 2 × moles N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in both H₂O and O₂. Moles O = (1 × moles H₂O) + (2 × moles O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nSo, the original mixture contained only H, N, and O atoms. The problem states the mixture consists of two salts, A and B, in an equimolar ratio. Let's say there are `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n\nThe combined formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B, let's call it (A+B), must have an elemental ratio of N:H:O corresponding to the molar ratio we found:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, we can divide by the smallest number (0.05):\nN : H : O = (0.20/0.05) : (0.40/0.05) : (0.25/0.05) = 4 : 8 : 5.\nSo, the combined empirical formula for (A+B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n**4. Identify the Individual Salts A and B**\n\nWe need to partition the formula N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salt formulas. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺). If we have two salts, we likely have two ammonium cations.\n*   Two NH₄⁺ ions have the formula N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting this from the total formula: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\n*   This N₂O₅ must be the sum of the two anions in salts A and B. The most common and simple nitrogen-oxygen anions (oxyanions) are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   Let's check if they sum to N₂O₅: NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ → N₂O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂** (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃** (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n\nLet's check the decomposition reactions. At ~200°C:\n*   NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃ (s) → 2N₂ (g) + O₂ (g) + 4H₂O (g)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's find the number of moles (`n`).\nMolar mass of (A+B) = M(N₄H₈O₅) = 4(14) + 8(1) + 5(16) = 56 + 8 + 80 = 144 g/mol.\nTotal mass of mixture = `n` × M(A+B) = 7.20 g\n`n` = 7.20 g / 144 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\nSo we have 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\nLet's see if this produces the correct amount of gas:\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio) → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.025 mol O₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   **Total products:**\n    *   N₂: 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches)\n    *   H₂O: 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol (Matches)\n    *   O₂: 0.025 mol (Matches)\nThe identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   Salt A is Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   Number of Nitrogen atoms = 2\n    *   Number of Hydrogen atoms = 4\n    *   Number of Oxygen atoms = 3\n    *   Total atoms in Salt A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   Salt B is Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n    *   Number of Nitrogen atoms = 2\n    *   Number of Hydrogen atoms = 4\n    *   Number of Oxygen atoms = 2\n    *   Total atoms in Salt B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each salt:\nTotal atoms = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Gas Processing and Identify Products**\n\n    *   The gas mixture from the decomposition is passed through three tubes. We can determine the composition of the gas mixture by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 L of gas C remains at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n2.  **Determine the Identity of Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\n    *   The total mass of the initial salt mixture was 7.20 g. By the law of conservation of mass, this must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n    *   Total mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(C)\n    *   Mass(C) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   We can now find the molar mass of gas C:\n        *   Molar Mass(C) = Mass(C) / Moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that is unreactive towards the reagents in tubes 1, 2, and 3 is diatomic nitrogen (N₂).\n\n    So, the decomposition of the 7.20 g salt mixture produced:\n    *   0.2 mol H₂O\n    *   0.025 mol O₂\n    *   0.1 mol N₂\n\n3.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\n    *   The elements in the products (H, O, N) must have come from the original salts A and B. Let's find the total moles of each element.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × Moles(H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × Moles(N₂) = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (1 × Moles(H₂O)) + (2 × Moles(O₂)) = (1 × 0.2 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   The ratio of atoms in the combined salts (A+B) is H : N : O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives H : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5.\n\n4.  **Identify Salts A and B**\n\n    *   The problem states we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. This means Moles(A) = Moles(B) = n.\n    *   The total moles of atoms (H=0.4, N=0.2, O=0.25) came from `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n    *   The combined formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B is therefore H₈N₄O₅.\n    *   We need to partition these atoms into two plausible, stable salts. Given the elements H, N, and O, ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions are very likely candidates.\n    *   Let's try to form salts using the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺), nitrate ion (NO₃⁻), and nitrite ion (NO₂⁻).\n        *   Salt A: Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**. Its formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n        *   Salt B: Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**. Its formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Let's check if the sum of their formulas matches our derived combined formula:\n        *   (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Let's verify this with the reaction stoichiometry. The decomposition of 1 mole of A and 1 mole of B should yield the same ratio of products we found.\n        *   Known decomposition of ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n        *   Known decomposition of ammonium nitrate at ~200°C can be complex, but a known pathway, especially at slightly higher temperatures, is: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O, which simplifies to NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O.\n    *   Combining the decomposition of 1 mole of each proposed salt:\n        *   (NH₄NO₃) + (NH₄NO₂) → (N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O) + (N₂ + 2H₂O)\n        *   Combined Reaction: A + B → 2N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 4H₂O\n    *   The molar ratio of products from this reaction is N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 2 : 0.5 : 4.\n    *   The molar ratio of products we found experimentally is N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 0.1 : 0.025 : 0.2.\n    *   Dividing the experimental moles by the smallest value (0.025) gives the ratio: 4 : 1 : 8.\n    *   Multiplying the theoretical reaction ratio by 2 gives: 4 : 1 : 8. The ratios match. All evidence points to salts A and B being ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\nA) 13\nB) 15\nC) 19\nD) 17\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products based on the Experimental Setup:**\n    *   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong desiccant, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂ (by forming a CaCO₃ precipitate) or SO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such gases were produced.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, meaning the copper was oxidized by an oxygen-containing gas. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n    *   **Gas C:** The remaining gas that did not react in any of the tubes has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol. This gas must be relatively inert, like nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Identify the Gases and Deduce the Composition of Salts A and B:**\n    *   The decomposition products are H₂O, an oxidizing gas containing 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms, and 0.10 mol of an inert gas C (likely N₂).\n    *   This combination of products (H₂O, N₂, and an oxidizing nitrogen oxide) is characteristic of the thermal decomposition of ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\n    *   Let's hypothesize the salts are **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**.\n    *   Their decomposition reactions are:\n        *   **NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)**\n        *   **NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)**\n\n3.  **Verify the Hypothesis with the Stoichiometry:**\n    *   The oxidizing gas is Nitrous Oxide (N₂O). It reacts with the hot copper in Tube №3:\n        *   **N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO**\n    *   From this reaction, 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of oxygen atoms to form CuO. Since we have 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms, we must have had **0.05 mol of N₂O**.\n    *   The problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let `n` be the moles of each salt.\n        *   From the decomposition of NH₄NO₃, moles of N₂O = moles of NH₄NO₃. So, **n = 0.05 mol**.\n        *   This means the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\n4.  **Check if this matches the other products:**\n    *   **Water (H₂O):**\n        *   From NH₄NO₃: 2 * n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n        *   From NH₄NO₂: 2 * n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n        *   Total H₂O = 0.10 + 0.10 = **0.20 mol**. This matches our calculation from Tube №1.\n\n    *   **Gas C (Final N₂):**\n        *   From NH₄NO₂ decomposition: n = **0.05 mol N₂**.\n        *   From the reaction of N₂O with Cu: Moles of N₂ produced = moles of N₂O reacted = **0.05 mol N₂**.\n        *   Total N₂ (Gas C) = 0.05 + 0.05 = **0.10 mol**. This matches our calculation for the remaining gas.\n\n5.  **Check the Total Initial Mass:**\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n    *   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64 g/mol = 3.2 g.\n    *   Total Mass = 4.0 g + 3.2 g = **7.20 g**. This matches the given initial mass.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The hypothesis is confirmed. Salts A and B are NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data to identify the products of the decomposition.**\n    *   An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g is heated. This produces a mixture of gases.\n    *   The gases are passed through a series of tubes.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This absorbs water. The mass increase is 3.60 g.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O is 1.008*2 + 16.00 ≈ 18.016 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a test for acidic gases like CO₂. The mass did not change, which means no acidic gas was present, or it was neutralized by an equimolar amount of a basic gas. Since the only likely basic gas from common salt decomposition is NH₃, and it would react with water to form NH₄OH, which would then react with CO₂, this scenario is complex but possible. However, the simplest explanation is that no net acidic gas was produced.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g. Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increase is due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO), meaning the mass gain is from oxygen atoms.\n        *   Molar mass of O is 16.00 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   This oxygen must have come from an oxygen-containing gas. Common gases that react with hot copper this way are O₂ or nitrogen oxides like N₂O. The reaction with N₂O is `Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂`. This reaction transfers one oxygen atom from N₂O to Cu. Therefore, 0.05 moles of N₂O would have reacted.\n    *   **Remaining gas C:** 2.24 L at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure).\n        *   1 mole of any gas at STP occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This gas C did not react with any of the previous reagents. This strongly suggests it is Nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Reconstruct the composition of the initial gas mixture.**\n    *   Based on the analysis above, the gases produced by heating the salts were:\n        *   0.20 mol of H₂O\n        *   0.05 mol of N₂O (which reacted in tube 3)\n        *   0.10 mol of N₂ (the final remaining gas)\n    *   However, if the reacting gas was N₂O, the reaction `Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂` would produce N₂. If 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted, it would produce 0.05 mol of N₂.\n    *   This means the final 0.10 mol of N₂ consists of 0.05 mol produced from N₂O and 0.05 mol that was present in the original gas mixture.\n    *   So, the initial gas mixture from the decomposition was:\n        *   0.20 mol H₂O\n        *   0.05 mol N₂O\n        *   0.05 mol N₂\n\n3.  **Identify the salts A and B.**\n    *   We need two salts that decompose upon heating to produce H₂O, N₂O, and N₂. Ammonium salts are excellent candidates.\n    *   Consider the decomposition of ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite:\n        *   Ammonium nitrate: `NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n        *   Ammonium nitrite: `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n    *   The problem states the mixture of salts A and B is equimolar. Let's assume there are `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B.\n    *   If Salt A is `NH₄NO₂` and Salt B is `NH₄NO₃`:\n        *   From `n` moles of `NH₄NO₂`, we get `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n        *   From `n` moles of `NH₄NO₃`, we get `n` moles of N₂O and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   Total products: `n` mol N₂, `n` mol N₂O, and `4n` mol H₂O.\n    *   Comparing this with our derived quantities:\n        *   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol  => `n = 0.05`\n        *   Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol => `n = 0.05`\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 0.20 mol => `4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20`.\n    *   The molar quantities match perfectly. So, the salts are ammonium nitrite (`NH₄NO₂`) and ammonium nitrate (`NH₄NO₃`).\n\n4.  **Verify the initial mass.**\n    *   Molar mass of `NH₄NO₂` = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 2(16.00) = 64.05 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of `NH₄NO₃` = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 3(16.00) = 80.05 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass = (moles of A * Molar Mass of A) + (moles of B * Molar Mass of B)\n    *   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.05 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.05 g/mol) = 3.2025 g + 4.0025 g = 7.205 g.\n    *   This is very close to the given mass of 7.20 g, confirming our identification of the salts.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total number of atoms in the formulas of the salts.**\n    *   Salt A: `NH₄NO₂`. It contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\n    *   Salt B: `NH₄NO₃`. It contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9.\n    *   The total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of atoms in their formulas: 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe calculation performed by the Python code confirms this result.\nTotal atoms = (atoms in `NH₄NO₂`) + (atoms in `NH₄NO₃`) = 8 + 9 = 17.\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nAn equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, weighs 7.20 g. When heated, this mixture decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. Let's analyze the fate of these gases.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Gaseous Products**\n    *   The gas mixture is first passed through a tube with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, a strong dehydrating agent. The mass of this tube increases by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water (H2O) absorbed.\n        *   Molar mass of H2O = 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H2O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n    *   Next, the remaining gas mixture is passed through a Ca(OH)2 solution. The mass of this tube does not change. This indicates the absence of acidic gases like CO2 or SO2.\n\n    *   Then, the gas is passed over red-hot copper. The mass of the copper tube increases by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This increase in mass is due to the oxygen (O2) reacting with the copper.\n        *   The reaction is 2Cu + O2 → 2CuO. The mass increase is the mass of O2.\n        *   Molar mass of O2 = 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O2 = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   Finally, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to the previous reagents.\n        *   At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n        *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this inert gas is most likely nitrogen (N2).\n\n2.  **Mass Conservation and Elemental Composition**\n    Let's check if the mass of the products equals the initial mass of the salts.\n    *   Mass of H2O = 3.60 g\n    *   Mass of O2 = 0.80 g\n    *   Mass of N2 = 0.1 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n    *   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n    This matches the initial mass, so our product identification is correct.\n\n    Now, let's find the total moles of each element in the original salt mixture.\n    *   Moles of Hydrogen (H) = 2 × moles of H2O = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Moles of Nitrogen (N) = 2 × moles of N2 = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen (O) = (moles of O in H2O) + (moles of O in O2) = (1 × 0.2 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n3.  **Identifying Salts A and B**\n    The problem states we have an equimolar mixture of A and B. This means the number of moles of A is equal to the number of moles of B. The total elemental composition of the mixture (from 0.4 mol H, 0.2 mol N, and 0.25 mol O) must be distributed between A and B.\n    The ratio of atoms in the combined formula (A + B) is H : N : O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20:\n    H : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5.\n    So, the combined empirical formula for one unit of A and one unit of B is H8N4O5.\n\n    We need to find two common thermally unstable salts whose formulas sum to H8N4O5. Given the products, ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids are likely candidates.\n    *   Let's consider **Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3)**. Its formula is H4N2O3.\n    *   Let's consider **Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2)**. Its formula is H4N2O2.\n\n    Let's sum these two formulas:\n    (H4N2O3) + (H4N2O2) = H(4+4)N(2+2)O(3+2) = H8N4O5.\n    This is a perfect match. So, the salts are A = NH4NO3 and B = NH4NO2.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n    *   Number of atoms in one formula unit of Salt A (NH4NO3): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Number of atoms in one formula unit of Salt B (NH4NO2): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n\n    Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental results to identify the products of decomposition.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H2O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced by the reaction.\n    *   Molar mass of H2O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H2O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases, most commonly CO2. Since its weight did not change, no CO2 was formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O2) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O2 ≈ 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O2 = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** The volume of the remaining gas is 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Gas C is what remains after passing through a water absorber, an acid gas absorber, and an oxygen absorber. Given that the original substances are salts (likely containing nitrogen), the most probable identity for this unreactive gas is nitrogen (N2).\n\n**2. Verify the composition using the law of conservation of mass.**\n\nLet's check if the total mass of the identified products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n*   Mass of H2O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O2 = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N2 = moles × molar mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g), which confirms our identification and calculation of the products are correct.\n\n**3. Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n\nThe atoms in the products must have come from the original salts A and B.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 2 (in H2O) × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O) atoms:** 1 (in H2O) × 0.20 mol + 2 (in O2) × 0.025 mol = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N) atoms:** 2 (in N2) × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol N.\n\nSo, the 7.20 g mixture contained 0.40 mol of H, 0.25 mol of O, and 0.20 mol of N. The molar ratio is H:O:N = 0.40:0.25:0.20, which simplifies to H:O:N = 8:5:4. The combined empirical formula of the mixture is N4H8O5.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nWe are looking for two salts, A and B, in an equimolar mixture, whose combined formula is N4H8O5. The elements present (N, H, O) strongly suggest ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\n*   Let's consider ammonium nitrite (NH4NO2) and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3).\n*   Formula of NH4NO2 is N2H4O2.\n*   Formula of NH4NO3 is N2H4O3.\n*   If we have one molecule of each, the combined formula is (N2H4O2) + (N2H4O3) = **N4H8O5**. This is a perfect match.\n*   Therefore, Salt A is NH4NO2 and Salt B is NH4NO3.\n\n**5. Calculate the final answer.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH4NO2):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH4NO3):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\n**1. Analysis of the experimental data:**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong desiccant and absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the formation of water (H₂O).\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   From this, we can find the moles of hydrogen atoms in the original mixture: n(H) = 2 × n(H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a test for acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since the mass did not change, no such gases were produced. This implies the original salts do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the reaction of an oxidizing gas with copper to form CuO. The mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms that reacted with Cu = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol. This oxygen could come from gases like O₂ or N₂O.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of an inert gas C remains at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given that the salts are likely nitrogen-based (a common component of salts that decompose into gases), this inert gas is most probably nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × n(N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n**2. Determining the elemental composition of the initial mixture:**\n\nLet's find the total moles and mass of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** n(H) = 0.40 mol. Mass = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** n(N) = 0.20 mol. Mass = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** The total oxygen is the sum of the oxygen in the water and the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   n(O) = n(O in H₂O) + n(O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   **Total Mass Check:** 0.40 g (H) + 2.80 g (N) + 4.00 g (O) = 7.20 g. This matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming that the salts A and B are composed only of N, H, and O.\n\n**3. Identifying Salts A and B:**\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the combined mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5.\n\nThe combined formula of (Salt A + Salt B) is N₄H₈O₅. Since the mixture is equimolar, we need to find two salts whose formulas sum to this. The most common salts containing N, H, and O are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\n\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Formula N₂H₄O₂\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Formula N₂H₄O₃\n\nLet's sum the formulas: (N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\nThus, salts A and B are **ammonium nitrite** and **ammonium nitrate**.\n\n**4. Calculating the total number of atoms:**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental data and identify the gaseous products.**\n\n*   An equimolar mixture of salts A and B (total mass = 7.20 g) is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases.\n*   The gas mixture is passed through three tubes sequentially.\n    1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H2O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H2O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H2O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H2O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO2 or SO2. The mass did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n    3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O2) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O2 → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube is equal to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Mass of O2 = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O2 = 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O2 = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper, indicating it is a relatively inert gas. Nitrogen (N2) is a common product of the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume at STP / Molar volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol. Let's assume Gas C is N2.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the products with the Law of Conservation of Mass.**\n\nLet's calculate the total mass of the gaseous products we have identified:\n*   Mass of H2O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O2 = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N2 = moles × molar mass = 0.1 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of gases = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis total mass is equal to the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). This confirms that our identification and calculation of the products (H2O, O2, N2) are correct.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the elemental composition of the salt mixture.**\n\nThe atoms in the product gases (N, H, O) must have come from the original salts A and B. Let's calculate the total moles of each element.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** from 0.2 mol of H2O → 0.2 mol × 2 = 0.4 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** from 0.1 mol of N2 → 0.1 mol × 2 = 0.2 mol N.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** from 0.2 mol of H2O and 0.025 mol of O2 → (0.2 mol × 1) + (0.025 mol × 2) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the combined mixture of A and B is N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\nN : H : O = (0.2 × 20) : (0.4 × 20) : (0.25 × 20) = 4 : 8 : 5.\nSo, the combined empirical formula for the equimolar mixture (one unit of A + one unit of B) is N4H8O5.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the individual salts A and B.**\n\nWe need to split the combined formula N4H8O5 into two plausible salt formulas.\n*   The salts contain N, H, and O. The formation of N2 and H2O upon heating suggests ammonium (NH4+) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\n*   The H8 part of the formula corresponds exactly to two ammonium ions: 2 × NH4+ = N2H8.\n*   If we take away N2H8 from N4H8O5, we are left with the atoms for the two anions: N(4-2)H(8-8)O5 = N2O5.\n*   We need to split N2O5 into two common nitrogen-containing oxyanions. The most common ones are nitrite (NO2⁻) and nitrate (NO3⁻).\n    *   NO2⁻ + NO3⁻ = N(1+1)O(2+3) = N2O5. This is a perfect match.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3).\n\n**Step 5: Verify the moles and decomposition reactions.**\n\nThe molar ratio of the products N2 : O2 : H2O was found to be 0.1 : 0.025 : 0.2, which simplifies to 4 : 1 : 8.\nLet's check if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of NH4NO2 and NH4NO3 yields this ratio.\n*   Decomposition of NH4NO2: NH4NO2 → N2 + 2H2O\n*   Decomposition of NH4NO3: 2NH4NO3 → 2N2 + O2 + 4H2O (or simplified per mole: NH4NO3 → N2 + 0.5O2 + 2H2O)\nFor an equimolar mixture (e.g., 1 mole of each):\n*   From 1 mole of NH4NO2: 1 mole N2, 2 moles H2O\n*   From 1 mole of NH4NO3: 1 mole N2, 0.5 mole O2, 2 moles H2O\n*   Total products: (1+1) moles N2, 0.5 moles O2, (2+2) moles H2O = 2 moles N2, 0.5 moles O2, 4 moles H2O.\n*   The molar ratio is N2 : O2 : H2O = 2 : 0.5 : 4, which simplifies to 4 : 1 : 8. This matches the experimental results, confirming the identities of salts A and B.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in their chemical formulas).\n*   **Salt A (NH4NO2):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 (in NH4+) + 1 (in NO2-) = 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in NH4NO2 = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH4NO3):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 (in NH4+) + 1 (in NO3-) = 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in NH4NO3 = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both salts = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data to identify the products of the decomposition.**\n    *   The initial sample is a 7.20 g equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B.\n    *   Heating this mixture produces only gases.\n    *   The gas mixture is passed through three tubes sequentially.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent.

The mass of the tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were produced.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen that reacted. The problem states CuO is formed (2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO), confirming this reaction.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Gas C must be inert as it did not react with the drying agent, the alkaline solution, or the hot copper. Given that we started with salts that decompose on heating, a very likely candidate for this inert gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Verify the composition and mass balance.**\n    *   Let's assume Gas C is N₂. We can calculate the total mass of the gaseous products and see if it matches the initial mass of the salts.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n    *   Mass of N₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n    *   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This total mass exactly matches the initial mass of the mixture of salts A and B. This confirms that H₂O, O₂, and N₂ are the only products and our calculations are correct.\n\n3.  **Determine the elemental composition of the initial mixture.**\n    *   Since mass is conserved, all atoms in the products must have come from the original salts A and B.\n    *   Moles of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen (O) atoms = (moles of H₂O) + 2 × (moles of O₂) = 0.20 mol + 2 × 0.025 mol = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Moles of Nitrogen (N) atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   The initial mixture contains 0.40 mol of H, 0.25 mol of O, and 0.20 mol of N.\n\n4.  **Identify the salts A and B.**\n    *   The problem states that the mixture of A and B is equimolar.

Analyze the Gas Analysis Data**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2(1.0) + 16.0 = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol H₂O**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such gases were formed in the decomposition. This tells us the original salts do not contain Carbon or Sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Copper at high temperature reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is purely the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol O atoms**.\n    *   Since the salts are likely nitrogen-based (a common theme in such problems), a very common oxidizing gas produced during decomposition is dinitrogen monoxide (N₂O). The reaction is `Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂`. In this reaction, one mole of N₂O provides one mole of oxygen atoms to the copper. Therefore, the amount of N₂O that passed through this tube was **0.05 mol N₂O**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   This gas passed through a water absorber, a base, and hot copper without reacting. This strongly indicates the gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nThe decomposition produced H₂O, N₂O, and N₂. Therefore, the original salts A and B must be composed only of Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N). Let's find the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen atoms ended up in the water.\n    *   Total H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol H**.\n\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The total N₂ collected (Gas C) is the sum of N₂ produced directly in the decomposition and the N₂ produced from the reduction of N₂O in tube №3.\n    *   Total N₂ collected = 0.10 mol.\n    *   N₂ from N₂O reduction (`Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂`) = moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Therefore, N₂ produced directly from decomposition = Total N₂ - N₂ from N₂O = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol N₂**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = (2 × moles of N₂ from decomp.) + (2 × moles of N₂O) = (2 × 0.05) + (2 × 0.05) = 0.10 + 0.10 = **0.20 mol N**.\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen atoms are found in the produced H₂O and N₂O.\n    *   Total O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O in N₂O) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol O**.\n\n*   **Verify Mass:** Let's check if the masses of the elements add up to the initial mass of the mixture.\n    *   Mass H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n    *   Mass N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n    *   Mass O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n    *   Total mass = 0.40 + 2.80 + 4.00 = 7.20 g. This matches perfectly.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture. The combined empirical formula of one unit of A and one unit of B can be found from the molar ratio of the elements:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get the simplest integer ratio, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\nSo, the combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to find two common salts made of N, H, and O that add up to this formula. Let's consider common ammonium salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrite: **NH₄NO₂** (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n*   Ammonium nitrate: **NH₄NO₃** (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n\nLet's check if they fit:\n*   **Sum of Formulas:** (N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\n*   **Decomposition Reactions (at ~200°C):**\n    *   `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n    *   `NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n    These reactions produce exactly the gases we identified (N₂, N₂O, and H₂O) in the correct molar ratios.\n\nTherefore, Salt A is Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Salt B is Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Experimental Data and Identify the Products\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gases are passed through a series of tubes, and the mass changes of these tubes provide information about the composition of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2**\n    *   This substance is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase is 3.60 g, which is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were produced in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, which implies the gas provided oxygen to the copper. The reaction could be with O₂, N₂O, NO, etc.\n    *   The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Mass of oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all the reagents used (Mg(ClO₄)₂, Ca(OH)₂, hot Cu), suggesting it is likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture\n\nThe initial salts A and B decomposed completely into the gaseous products we've just quantified. By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass and elemental composition of the products must equal that of the initial reactants.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × n(H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and the species that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = n(O in H₂O) + n(O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   **Other Elements (likely Nitrogen, N):** The total initial mass was 7.20 g. We can find the mass of the remaining elements by subtraction.\n    *   Mass of other elements = Total mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O)\n    *   Mass of other elements = 7.20 g - (Mass of H₂O + Mass of O reacted with Cu) = 7.20 g - (3.60 g + 0.80 g) = 2.80 g.\n    *   Let's assume the remaining element is nitrogen, as is common in decomposing salts. The final inert gas C is also likely N₂.\n    *   If the mass is 2.80 g of Nitrogen, then:\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   If the final gas C is N₂, its number of moles would be n(N₂) = 0.20 mol N / 2 = 0.10 mol. This perfectly matches the calculated moles of gas C from its volume.\n    *   This confirms our assumption: the salts contain only Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n### 3. Determine the Formulas of Salts A and B\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. This means we have some number of moles, `x`, of salt A and `x` moles of salt B. The total elemental composition we found (0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, 0.25 mol O) corresponds to this entire mixture.\n\nThe molar ratio of elements in the combined mixture (A + B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nThis means that the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to find two plausible inorganic salts, A and B, that contain N, H, and O, and whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The most common and simple salts fitting this description are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxoacids.\nLet's consider:\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N(2+2)H(4+4)O(3+2) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n(We can also quickly verify this with the decomposition reactions. At ~200°C:\nNH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\nNH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\nIf we have `x` moles of each, we get `x` mol N₂, `x` mol N₂O, and `4x` mol H₂O.\nThe N₂O reacts with Cu: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\nThe products match the experimental results perfectly, confirming the identity of the salts.)\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (e.g., NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (e.g., NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in A and B:**\n    *   Total atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe total number of atoms is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental results to identify the gaseous products.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = mass / molar mass = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, etc. Since the weight of this tube did not change, it means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition of the salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This means an oxidizing gas passed through the tube and reacted with copper. The increase in mass is solely due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Reaction: `Gas-O + Cu → CuO + ...`\n    *   The mass increase is the mass of oxygen. Mass of O = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = mass / molar mass = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the reagents used.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n**2. Formulate a hypothesis about the identity of salts A and B.**\n\n*   The initial substance is a mixture of two salts, A and B, that decompose upon heating to form *only* a mixture of gases. This is a very strong clue. This behavior is characteristic of certain ammonium salts of volatile acids, particularly those containing oxygen and nitrogen.\n*   The products include water (H₂O), an oxygen-providing gas, and an inert gas. This strongly suggests the salts are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n*   Let's assume this hypothesis is correct and test it against the experimental data.\n    *   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)**\n    *   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)** (at ~200°C)\n\n**3. Test the hypothesis using the quantitative data.**\n\n*   The gas mixture produced would consist of N₂, N₂O, and H₂O.\n    *   N₂ is inert. It would be the final gas C (or part of it).\n    *   N₂O is an oxidizing gas. It would react with hot copper: **N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂**.\n    *   H₂O is absorbed by Mg(ClO₄)₂.\n    *   No acidic gases are produced, which is consistent with the observation for tube №2.\n\n*   Let `n` be the number of moles for each salt, since the initial mixture is equimolar.\n    *   From the decomposition reactions:\n        *   Moles of N₂ produced = `n` (from NH₄NO₂)\n        *   Moles of N₂O produced = `n` (from NH₄NO₃)\n        *   Total moles of H₂O produced = `2n` (from NH₄NO₂) + `2n` (from NH₄NO₃) = `4n`.\n\n*   Now, let's use the experimental mole quantities:\n    *   We found that 0.2 mol of H₂O was produced. So, `4n = 0.2 mol`, which gives **`n = 0.05 mol`**.\n    *   This means the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of salt A (NH₄NO₂) and 0.05 mol of salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   Let's check the other products:\n    *   Moles of N₂O produced = `n` = 0.05 mol. When this reacts with copper (`N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂`), it provides 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Mass of oxygen = 0.05 mol * 16 g/mol = 0.80 g. This perfectly matches the mass increase of tube №3.\n    *   The gas remaining (gas C) would be all the nitrogen. This includes the initial N₂ from the decomposition of NH₄NO₂ and the N₂ produced from the reaction of N₂O with copper.\n    *   Total moles of N₂ = (moles N₂ from NH₄NO₂) + (moles N₂ from N₂O reaction) = `n` + `n` = 0.05 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   The volume of this gas at STP is 0.1 mol * 22.4 L/mol = 2.24 L. This perfectly matches the volume of gas C.\n\n**4. Verify the initial mass.**\n\n*   Molar mass of A (NH₄NO₂) = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of B (NH₄NO₃) = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (moles of A × molar mass of A) + (moles of B × molar mass of B)\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n*   This matches the given initial weight of the mixture. The hypothesis is fully confirmed.\n\n**5. Determine the total number of atoms.**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** The formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** The formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental data to identify the products and their quantities.**\n\n*   The mixture of salts A and B is heated, and only gases are formed. These gases are passed through a series of tubes.\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of this tube is equal to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, etc. The mass of this tube did not change.\n    *   This indicates that no acidic gases were produced in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in the mass of the tube is due to the mass of the oxygen atoms that have reacted.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since the gas is molecular oxygen (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining gas C:** After removing H₂O and O₂, 2.24 L of gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n*   **Identify gas C:** We can use the law of conservation of mass. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the reactants (7.20 g).\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol × 32.0 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of gas C = Total mass - Mass of H₂O - Mass of O₂\n    *   Mass of gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now, we can find the molar mass of gas C.\n    *   Molar Mass of C = Mass of C / Moles of C = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n    *   A gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is inert to the reagents used is nitrogen (N₂). So, gas C is N₂.\n\n**2. Determine the chemical formulas of salts A and B.**\n\n*   The products of the decomposition are N₂, O₂, and H₂O. This means the original salts must contain the elements Nitrogen (N), Oxygen (O), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   Since they are salts and decompose completely into gases, they are likely ammonium salts of oxygen-containing anions. The most common and plausible candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n*   Let's test this hypothesis. Let salt A be NH₄NO₃ and salt B be NH₄NO₂.\n*   The decomposition reactions are:\n    *   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O (This is a high-temperature decomposition, which fits the products)\n*   The problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let's say there were `x` moles of salt A and `x` moles of salt B.\n*   Let's calculate the total moles of each product based on `x` moles of each salt:\n    *   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₂(B): `x` mol of N₂ and `2x` mol of H₂O.\n    *   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₃(A): `x` mol of N₂ (from 2N₂/2NH₄NO₃), `0.5x` mol of O₂ (from O₂/2NH₄NO₃), and `2x` mol of H₂O (from 4H₂O/2NH₄NO₃).\n*   Total moles of products:\n    *   Total N₂ = `x` (from B) + `x` (from A) = `2x`\n    *   Total O₂ = `0.5x` (from A)\n    *   Total H₂O = `2x` (from B) + `2x` (from A) = `4x`\n*   Now, we equate these with the experimental values we found:\n    *   Total N₂ = 0.1 mol  => `2x = 0.1` => `x = 0.05`\n    *   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol => `0.5x = 0.025` => `x = 0.05`\n    *   Total H₂O = 0.2 mol  => `4x = 0.2` => `x = 0.05`\n*   All three calculations give a consistent value of `x = 0.05` mol. This strongly supports our hypothesis.\n\n**3. Verify the total mass.**\n\n*   The mixture contains 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 4.0 g + 3.2 g = 7.20 g.\n*   This matches the initial mass given in the problem. Our identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**4. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of each tube and identify the products.**\n    *   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong desiccant (drying agent). Its purpose is to absorb water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to test for acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no CO₂ was produced.\n    *   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O₂). The reaction is `2Cu(s) + O₂(g) -> 2CuO(s)`. The increase in the mass of the tube is due to the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Mass of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of oxygen gas produced are half the moles of oxygen atoms: Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains. This measurement is at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n        *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, limewater, or hot copper. The products contain H, O, and N (from the salts). The most likely candidate for this inert gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Summarize the decomposition products.**\n    The decomposition of salts A and B produces:\n    *   0.2 mol of H₂O\n    *   0.025 mol of O₂\n    *   0.1 mol of N₂\n\n3.  **Deduce the composition of salts A and B.**\n    *   The products (H₂O, N₂, O₂) show that the original salts must contain the elements Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O).\n    *   The fact that they are salts and decompose completely into gases strongly suggests they are ammonium salts containing an oxygen-and-nitrogen-based anion.\n    *   Let's hypothesize the salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n4.  **Write the balanced decomposition equations and check stoichiometry.**\n    Let's assume the mixture contains `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B (equimolar mixture).\n\n    *   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite):** `NH₄NO₂(s) -> N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n        *   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂, we get `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate):** The decomposition of ammonium nitrate can produce different products depending on the temperature. A common reaction that produces O₂ is: `2NH₄NO₃(s) -> 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)`. Let's use this stoichiometry.\n        *   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃, we get `n` moles of N₂, `n/2` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\n5.  **Relate the stoichiometry to the experimental results to find 'n'.**\n    *   **Total Moles of H₂O:** `2n` (from A) + `2n` (from B) = `4n`.\n        *   `4n = 0.2` mol => `n = 0.05` mol.\n    *   **Total Moles of O₂:** `0` (from A) + `n/2` (from B) = `n/2`.\n        *   `n/2 = 0.025` mol => `n = 0.05` mol.\n    *   **Total Moles of N₂:** `n` (from A) + `n` (from B) = `2n`.\n        *   `2n = 0.1` mol => `n = 0.05` mol.\n\n    All calculations consistently give `n = 0.05` mol. This confirms our identification of the salts and their decomposition reactions is correct.\n\n6.  **Verify the initial mass.**\n    *   Molar mass of A (NH₄NO₂): (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 1.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 64.06 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of B (NH₄NO₃): (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 1.01) + (3 × 16.00) = 80.06 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass of the mixture = `n * M_A + n * M_B`\n    *   Total mass = `0.05 mol * (64.06 g/mol + 80.06 g/mol)`\n    *   Total mass = `0.05 * 144.12` = 7.206 g.\n    This is in excellent agreement with the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n7.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms =** 8 (from A) + 9 (from B) = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the mass changes in the tubes to identify the gaseous products.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced by the decomposition.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂ (by forming a precipitate, CaCO₃). Since the mass of the tube did not change, no CO₂ or other acidic gases were formed. This indicates the salts do not contain carbonate ions or organic anions that would decompose into CO₂.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O₂), but also others like nitrogen oxides (e.g., N₂O). The reaction with oxygen is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, limewater, or hot copper. The most plausible identity for such an inert gas in the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\n\nThe elements in the products (H₂O, O-atoms, N₂) must have originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen ends up as the final gas C, which we identified as N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water produced and in the copper oxide formed.\n    *   Moles of O = (Moles of O in H₂O) + (Moles of O reacted with Cu)\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × 0.20 mol) + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   **Verify Total Mass:**\n    *   Total mass = Mass(H) + Mass(N) + Mass(O) = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming that the salts A and B are composed only of hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. They are salts, implying an ionic structure, likely consisting of the ammonium cation (NH₄⁺) and an oxygen-containing anion of nitrogen (oxyanion). The most common such salts are:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles of salt A and 'n' be the number of moles of salt B. We can use the total moles of each element to find 'n'.\n\nLet's assume A = NH₄NO₂ and B = NH₄NO₃.\n*   Formula of A: N₂H₄O₂\n*   Formula of B: N₂H₄O₃\n\nNow, let's write the balance for total moles of each element in the mixture:\n*   **Total H:** n(moles of H in A) + n(moles of H in B) = n(4) + n(4) = 8n.\n    *   We found total moles of H = 0.40 mol. So, 8n = 0.40 ⇒ n = 0.05 mol.\n*   **Total N:** n(moles of N in A) + n(moles of N in B) = n(2) + n(2) = 4n.\n    *   We found total moles of N = 0.20 mol. So, 4n = 0.20 ⇒ n = 0.05 mol.\n*   **Total O:** n(moles of O in A) + n(moles of O in B) = n(2) + n(3) = 5n.\n    *   We found total moles of O = 0.25 mol. So, 5n = 0.25 ⇒ n = 0.05 mol.\n\nThe value n = 0.05 mol is consistent for all three elements. This confirms that the salts are indeed ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n**4. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms:**\n    *   Total = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe total number of atoms is 17. This corresponds to option B.\n\nTo be thorough, let's check if the decomposition reactions match the products.\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   0.05 mol → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O\n*   There are two main decomposition paths for NH₄NO₃. Both are consistent with our findings.\n    *   Path 1: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n        *   0.05 mol → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.025 mol O₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O\n    *   Path 2: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g), where N₂O then reacts with Cu: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\n        *   0.05 mol → 0.05 mol N₂O + 0.10 mol H₂O\n\nTotal products (using Path 1):\n*   Total N₂ = 0.05 (from A) + 0.05 (from B) = 0.10 mol (matches Gas C).\n*   Total H₂O = 0.10 (from A) + 0.10 (from B) = 0.20 mol (matches Tube 1).\n*   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol (from B). This contains 0.05 mol of O atoms (matches Tube 3).\n\nThe analysis is fully consistent.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nAn equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, weighs 7.20 g. Upon heating to 200°C, it decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. The products are analyzed sequentially.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the products:**\n    *   The gas mixture is passed through a tube with anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂, a powerful drying agent. The mass of this tube increases by 3.60 g. This mass gain is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n        *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 1.01*2 + 16.00 = 18.02 g/mol\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol\n\n    *   Next, the gas passes through a Ca(OH)₂ solution. The mass of this tube does not change. This indicates that no acidic gas, such as CO₂, was produced. Therefore, the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n    *   Then, the gas is passed over red-hot copper (Cu). The mass of this tube increases by 0.80 g. Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen gas.\n        *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ = 16.00 * 2 = 32.00 g/mol\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol\n\n    *   Finally, 2.24 L of a remaining gas C is collected at standard temperature and pressure (STP). At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol\n        *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. Given that the products contain H, O, and must contain another element from the salts, the most likely candidate for this inert gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Summary of Products and Mass Conservation:**\n    *   Products are: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n    *   Let's check the total mass of the products:\n        *   Mass H₂O = 0.20 mol * 18.02 g/mol = 3.60 g\n        *   Mass O₂ = 0.025 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g\n        *   Mass N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n        *   Total mass = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g\n    *   This matches the initial mass of the salt mixture, confirming our identification of the products and their quantities.\n\n3.  **Identification of Salts A and B:**\n    *   The products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) indicate that the original salts must contain the elements H, O, and N.\n    *   Since they are salts, they are composed of a cation and an anion. A common cation containing H and N is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). Common anions containing N and O are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n    *   Let's hypothesize that the salts are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n4.  **Stoichiometry of Decomposition:**\n    *   The decomposition of ammonium nitrite is: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   The decomposition of ammonium nitrate must produce N₂, O₂, and H₂O. The balanced equation that fits the products is: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n5.  **Solving for the Moles of Each Salt:**\n    *   The problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let `x` be the moles of NH₄NO₃ and `x` be the moles of NH₄NO₂.\n    *   From the decomposition reactions:\n        *   Total moles of O₂ produced = `x/2` (only from NH₄NO₃)\n        *   Total moles of N₂ produced = `x` (from NH₄NO₂) + `x` (from NH₄NO₃) = `2x`\n        *   Total moles of H₂O produced = `2x` (from NH₄NO₂) + `2x` (from NH₄NO₃) = `4x`\n    *   Using the experimental moles of O₂:\n        *   moles of O₂ = `x/2` = 0.025 mol\n        *   Solving for `x`: x = 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n    *   Let's verify this with the other products:\n        *   Predicted moles of N₂ = 2x = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (Matches)\n        *   Predicted moles of H₂O = 4x = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (Matches)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n    *   Salt A: NH₄NO₃\n        *   Atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 3 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms\n    *   Salt B: NH₄NO₂\n        *   Atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 2 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = 8 atoms\n    *   Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17\n\nThe total number of atoms in the two salt formulas is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data to identify the products of the decomposition.**\n    *   An initial equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, weighing 7.20 g, is heated.

The gas produced is not H₂O, not O₂, and not an acidic gas. The most plausible identity for Gas C, formed from heating nitrogen-containing salts, is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n2.  **Determine the elemental composition of the original salts.**\n    *   The products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. By the law of conservation of mass, the original salts must be composed of Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N).\n    *   Let's check if the total mass of the elements in the products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g).\n        *   Mass of H = 0.20 mol H₂O * (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) * 1.0 g/mol H = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass of O = (0.20 mol H₂O * 16.0 g/mol O) + (0.025 mol O₂ * 32.0 g/mol O₂) - Mass O in O₂ = (0.20 mol * 16.0 g/mol) + 0.80 g = 3.20 g + 0.80 g = 4.00 g.\n        *   Mass of N = 0.10 mol N₂ * 28.0 g/mol N₂ = 2.80 g.\n        *   Total Mass = 0.40 g (H) + 4.00 g (O) + 2.80 g (N) = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass perfectly, confirming our identification of the products.\n\n3.  **Identify salts A and B.**\n    *   We need to find two salts made of N, H, and O.\n    *   The most common cation formed from H and N is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺).\n    *   Common anions formed from N and O are the nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻) ions.\n    *   Therefore, the most likely candidates for salts A and B are **ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).**\n\n4.  **Use stoichiometry to confirm the identities and quantities.**\n    *   Let `n` be the number of moles for both salt A and salt B (since they are in an equimolar mixture).\n    *   Consider the known thermal decomposition reactions:\n        *   **NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)**\n        *   **2NH₄NO₃ (s) → 2N₂ (g) + O₂ (g) + 4H₂O (g)** (This reaction occurs under specific conditions but fits our products).\n    *   Let's write equations for the total moles of each product based on `n` moles of each salt:\n        *   Total moles N₂ = n (from NH₄NO₂) + n (from NH₄NO₃) = 2n\n        *   Total moles H₂O = 2n (from NH₄NO₂) + 2n (from NH₄NO₃) = 4n\n        *   Total moles O₂ = 0 (from NH₄NO₂) + 0.5n (from NH₄NO₃) = 0.5n\n    *   Now, we use our experimental mole data to solve for `n`:\n        *   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**.\n    *   Let's verify this value of `n` with the other products:\n        *   N₂: 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol.

Analyze the Experimental Data and Identify the Products**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gas mixture is passed through a series of traps to identify its components.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water. The mass of this tube increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water (`H₂O`) produced during the decomposition.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a lime water test, used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (`CO₂`), which would form a precipitate (`CaCO₃`). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no `CO₂` or other acidic gas was present in the mixture. This tells us the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g. The reaction involves the copper being oxidized to copper(II) oxide (`CuO`). The mass increase is solely due to the mass of oxygen atoms that have reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas (C) remains under standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Formulate a Hypothesis about the Salts' Identities**\n\nThe decomposition produces `H₂O`, an oxygen-donating gas, and another inert gas, but no `CO₂`. The presence of H, O, and N (as a likely component of the inert gas) points towards ammonium salts of nitrogen oxoacids. Two common examples that fit this profile are ammonium nitrite (`NH₄NO₂`) and ammonium nitrate (`NH₄NO₃`).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that salts A and B are `NH₄NO₂` and `NH₄NO₃`. Their decomposition reactions upon heating are:\n*   `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n*   `NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n\nSo, the initial gas mixture would contain `N₂`, `N₂O`, and `H₂O`.\n\n**3. Verify the Hypothesis Quantitatively**\n\nThe problem states that the initial mixture was equimolar. Let `n` be the number of moles of salt A (`NH₄NO₂`) and also `n` for salt B (`NH₄NO₃`).\n\n*   **Water (H₂O):** From the reactions, `NH₄NO₂` produces `2n` moles of H₂O, and `NH₄NO₃` also produces `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H₂O = `2n + 2n = 4n`.\n    *   From our analysis in step 1, we know 0.20 mol of H₂O was produced.\n    *   Therefore, `4n = 0.20` mol, which means `n = 0.05` mol.\n\n*   **Oxygen for Tube №3:** Let's see which gas reacts with the hot copper. `N₂` is very stable and would not react. `N₂O` (nitrous oxide) will decompose on hot copper in the reaction: `N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO`.\n    *   From the decomposition of `n` moles of `NH₄NO₃`, `n` moles of `N₂O` are produced.\n    *   Each mole of `N₂O` contains one mole of oxygen atoms. Thus, `n` moles of `N₂O` provide `n` moles of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n    *   From step 1, we know 0.05 mol of O atoms reacted.\n    *   Therefore, `n = 0.05` mol. This result is consistent with the value of `n` we calculated from the amount of water.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** Gas C is what's left after Tube 3. The gases entering Tube 3 are `N₂` and `N₂O`.\n    *   `N₂` from `NH₄NO₂` decomposition: `n` moles.\n    *   `N₂O` from `NH₄NO₃` decomposition: `n` moles. This reacts completely to form `N₂` gas: `N₂O → N₂ + [O]`.\n    *   So, the total moles of `N₂` (Gas C) exiting Tube 3 is the initial `n` moles plus the `n` moles from the `N₂O` reaction.\n    *   Total moles of Gas C = `n + n = 2n`.\n    *   Using `n = 0.05` mol, the moles of Gas C = `2 * 0.05 = 0.10` mol.\n    *   This perfectly matches the 0.10 mol of Gas C we calculated from the volume in step 1.\n\n**4. Check the Initial Mass**\n\nThe hypothesis holds true for all products. Let's check if the initial mass is also correct.\n\n*   Salt A: `NH₄NO₂` (Molar Mass ≈ 14+4+14+32 = 64 g/mol)\n*   Salt B: `NH₄NO₃` (Molar Mass ≈ 14+4+14+48 = 80 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = (moles of A × Molar Mass of A) + (moles of B × Molar Mass of B)\n*   Total mass = `(0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol)`\n*   Total mass = `3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g`.\nThis matches the given initial weight. Our identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in their chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   2 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   3 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both salts = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe problem states that a 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B is heated, producing only a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze the effect on each tube:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The mass did not change, which means no such acidic gases were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, and the tube's weight increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is due to oxygen atoms binding with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) = 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) trapped by Cu = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The source of this oxygen could be O₂ gas (reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO) or an oxygen-containing gas like nitrous oxide, N₂O (reaction: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂). Both scenarios involve 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms being transferred.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since this gas passed through all tubes unreacted, it must be inert. Nitrogen gas (N₂) is a very likely candidate.\n\n**2. Determine the Identity of the Salts**\n\nLet's work backward from the products to identify the original salts.\nThe decomposition produced H, N, and O atoms. This means salts A and B must be compounds containing these elements. The fact that they decompose completely into gases suggests they might be ammonium salts.\n\nLet's consider two plausible chemical scenarios for the decomposition. Both lead to the same answer.\n\n**Scenario A (Decomposition to N₂, O₂, H₂O):**\nThis scenario assumes the gas reacting with Cu is O₂.\n*   Moles of O atoms = 0.05 mol, so moles of O₂ molecules = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n*   The gas mixture produced was: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂ (Gas C).\n*   The molar ratio of products is N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 0.10 : 0.025 : 0.20. Dividing by 0.025 gives a simple integer ratio of **4 : 1 : 8**.\n\n**Scenario B (Decomposition to N₂, N₂O, H₂O - Chemically more likely at 200°C):**\nThis scenario assumes the gas reacting with Cu is N₂O.\n*   The reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n*   To trap 0.05 mol of O atoms, 0.05 mol of N₂O must have reacted.\n*   This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   The final Gas C (0.10 mol N₂) is the sum of the N₂ from this reaction (0.05 mol) and any N₂ that was initially produced and passed through Tube 3 unreacted.\n*   Initial N₂ = 0.10 mol (total) - 0.05 mol (from N₂O) = 0.05 mol.\n*   So, the original gas mixture was: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂, and 0.05 mol N₂O.\n\n**3. Test the Hypothesized Salts**\nLet's test if an equimolar mixture of **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) ** and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** fits our data.\n\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate (at ~200°C): NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nLet the equimolar amount of each salt in the initial mixture be 'n' moles.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: n moles of N₂O and 2n moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = n moles\n*   Total N₂O = n moles\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n moles\n\nNow, we match this with the products derived in Scenario B:\n*   Total N₂ = n = 0.05 mol\n*   Total N₂O = n = 0.05 mol\n*   Total H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol\n\nThe results match perfectly. Thus, the mixture consists of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Verify the Total Mass**\n\nLet's check if the mass of this mixture is 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThe mass matches the value given in the problem. The identification of salts A and B as NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃ is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   2 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   3 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms\n\nTotal number of atoms in salts A and B = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n**1. Identify the products and their quantities:**\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** Absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** Absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂). The weight did not change, so no acidic gases were produced.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Reacts with oxygen (O₂) via 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The weight increase of 0.80 g is the mass of O₂.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas volume is 2.24 L at STP. This gas did not react with the previous reagents.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   The total mass of the products is 3.60 g (H₂O) + 0.80 g (O₂) + (0.10 mol * 28.0 g/mol N₂) = 3.60 + 0.80 + 2.80 = 7.20 g. This equals the initial mass of the salt mixture, confirming that Gas C is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Identify the salts A and B:**\nThe decomposition produces H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This points to ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\nLet's consider the decomposition of two such salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂): NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃): 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nLet the mixture contain *n* moles of salt A (NH₄NO₂) and *n* moles of salt B (NH₄NO₃) since it is an equimolar mixture.\n\n**3. Set up stoichiometric equations:**\n*   From *n* mol of NH₄NO₂, we get: *n* mol N₂ and 2*n* mol H₂O.\n*   From *n* mol of NH₄NO₃, we get: *n* mol N₂ (from 0.5*n* of the 2-mol reaction), 0.5*n* mol O₂, and 2*n* mol H₂O.\n\n**Total moles of products:**\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 2*n + 2*n = 4*n\n*   Total moles of O₂ = 0 + 0.5*n = 0.5*n\n*   Total moles of N₂ = n + n = 2*n\n\n**4. Solve for *n*:**\nWe can use any of the product quantities to find *n*. Using oxygen is the most direct:\n*   Total moles of O₂ = 0.5*n = 0.025 mol\n*   *n* = 0.025 / 0.5 = 0.05 mol\n\nLet's verify this value of *n* with the other products:\n*   Total moles of N₂ = 2*n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches the experimental value)\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 4*n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol (Matches the experimental value)\n\nThe identities of the salts are confirmed as **NH₄NO₂** (Salt A) and **NH₄NO₃** (Salt B).\n\n**5. Calculate the total number of atoms:**\nThe question asks for the sum of the number of atoms in the chemical formulas of Salt A and Salt B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Gas Separation Process:**\n    *   The mixture of gases is passed through three tubes to identify its components.\n    *   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, there were no acidic gases in the mixture. This implies the original salts A and B do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n    *   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in the tube's weight is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that have combined with the copper.\n        *   Mass increase = Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ gas, the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation:**\n    *   The total initial mass of salts was 7.20 g. This must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n    *   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O₂ produced = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.025 mol × 32 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now, we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n        *   Molar Mass of C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n    *   A gas that is inert to the reagents used and has a molar mass of 28 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂). So, Gas C is N₂.\n\n3.  **Determine the Identity of Salts A and B:**\n    *   The decomposition products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This means the original salts must contain only the elements Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n    *   Salts that decompose upon heating to produce only these gases are typically ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. The most common examples are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃.\n    *   **Decomposition reactions:**\n        *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n    *   The problem states we have an **equimolar mixture**.

The initial mixture is equimolar, so let the number of moles of each salt be 'n'.\n    *   **From n mol of NH₄NO₂:** we get n mol of N₂ and 2n mol of H₂O.\n    *   **From n mol of NH₄NO₃:** we get n mol of N₂, 0.5n mol of O₂, and 2n mol of H₂O.\n    *   **Total moles of products:**\n        *   Total N₂ = n + n = **2n**\n        *   Total O₂ = 0 + 0.5n = **0.5n**\n        *   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = **4n**\n    *   Now we use our calculated moles of products to find 'n':\n        *   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**\n        *   From N₂ (Gas C): 2n = 0.10 mol => **n = 0.05 mol**\n        *   From H₂O: 4n ≈ 0.20 mol  => **n ≈ 0.05 mol**\n    *   All calculations yield a consistent value of n = 0.05 mol, confirming our identification of the salts.\n\n5.  **Verify the Initial Mass:**\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01 + 4(1.008) + 14.01 + 2(16.00) ≈ 64.05 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01 + 4(1.008) + 14.01 + 3(16.00) ≈ 80.05 g/mol\n    *   Total mass = (mass of NH₄NO₂) + (mass of NH₄NO₃)\n    *   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.05 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.05 g/mol)\n    *   Total mass = 3.2025 g + 4.0025 g = **7.205 g**\n    *   This is in excellent agreement with the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B combined.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated, producing a mixture of gases. This gas mixture was passed through several tubes, allowing us to identify the components and their quantities.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Gaseous Products:**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a dehydrating agent. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n        *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no significant amount of acidic gases were produced.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Molar Mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After the absorption of water and oxygen, 2.24 L of a gas remains at STP. This corresponds to:\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   The products are H₂O, O₂, and an inert gas (C). This points to the original salts being composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). Therefore, Gas C is most likely Nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Identifying the Salts A and B:**\n    *   The decomposition products are N₂, O₂, and H₂O. The original salts must contain N, H, and O. Common salts with these elements are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). Let's test this hypothesis.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃.\n    *   The decomposition reactions at around 200°C are:\n        *   A: `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n        *   B: `2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)` or for one mole: `NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂(g) + 0.5O₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n    *   The problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles for both salt A and salt B.\n    *   From the decomposition of `n` moles of each salt, the total moles of products are:\n        *   Total Moles of O₂ = `n * 0.5` (only from salt B)\n        *   Total Moles of N₂ = `n * 1` (from A) + `n * 1` (from B) = `2n`\n        *   Total Moles of H₂O = `n * 2` (from A) + `n * 2` (from B) = `4n`\n\n3.  **Verifying the Hypothesis:**\n    *   We can find 'n' using the moles of oxygen calculated earlier:\n        *   0.025 mol O₂ = 0.5n  =>  n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of salt A and 0.05 mol of salt B.\n    *   Let's check if this value of 'n' gives the correct amounts of the other products:\n        *   Predicted Moles of N₂ = 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches experiment).\n        *   Predicted Moles of H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol (Matches experiment).\n    *   Finally, let's check the initial total mass:\n        *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.0 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol * 64.0 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n        *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.0 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol * 80.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   Total Mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g (Matches the given initial mass).\n    *   The hypothesis is correct: Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n    *   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total Atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a chemical decomposition and subsequent reactions of the resulting gases.\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong desiccant (drying agent). The weight increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O formed = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which turns cloudy in the presence of acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The fact that its weight did not change means **no acidic gases were produced** in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms that reacted = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen must have come from an oxidizing gas. Given that the salts contain nitrogen, a likely candidate is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction would be N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This would mean 0.05 mol of N₂O was in the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas, C, has a volume of 2.24 L at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all the previous reagents. The most plausible gas from the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Products of Decomposition**\n\nBased on the analysis, the gaseous products of the decomposition were:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂O (which was consumed in tube №3)\n*   An amount of N₂ that, combined with the N₂ from the N₂O reaction, totals 0.10 mol.\n\nThe reaction in tube №3 (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO) shows that 0.05 mol of N₂O produces 0.05 mol of N₂. Since the total final N₂ is 0.10 mol, another 0.05 mol of N₂ must have been produced directly during the initial heating.\nSo, the initial gaseous products were:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states we started with an equimolar mixture (e.g., `x` moles of A and `x` moles of B). We need to find two salts whose decomposition in a 1:1 molar ratio produces the gases calculated above.\n\nConsider the decomposition of common ammonium salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O (when heated to ~200-250°C)\n\nLet's assume A is NH₄NO₃ and B is NH₄NO₂. If we had 0.05 mol of each:\n*   0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ → 0.05 mol N₂O + (0.05 * 2) mol H₂O = 0.05 mol N₂O + 0.10 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ → 0.05 mol N₂ + (0.05 * 2) mol H₂O = 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O\n\nTotal products:\n*   N₂O: 0.05 mol\n*   N₂: 0.05 mol\n*   H₂O: 0.10 mol + 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol\n\nThese product amounts perfectly match what we deduced from the experimental data.\n\n**4. Verify the Total Mass**\nLet's check if the mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ equals the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14+4(1)+14+3(16) = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14+4(1)+14+2(16) = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 80.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64.0 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 4.0 g + 3.2 g = 7.20 g.\nThis confirms the identities and amounts of salts A and B.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total atoms in both salts = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process that led to the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products from the Decomposition**\n    The problem describes passing a mixture of gases through a series of tubes, which separate the components based on their chemical properties.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent (desiccant), so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 1.01 * 2 + 16.00 = 18.02 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since the weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This rules out salts containing carbonate or sulfite anions.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ = 16.00 * 2 = 32.00 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** A gas that doesn't react with a strong desiccant, a base, or hot copper is very likely nitrogen (N₂).\n        *   Volume of Gas C = 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   The molar volume of a gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n        *   Moles of N₂ = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n2.  **Verify Mass Conservation**\n    Let's check if the total mass of the gaseous products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n    *   Mass of N₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × (14.01 * 2 g/mol) = 2.80 g\n    *   Total Mass of Products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n    This exactly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g), confirming that H₂O, O₂, and N₂ are the only products.\n\n3.  **Deduce the Identity of the Salts**\n    *   The products contain Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n    *   The decomposition produced only gases, which suggests the salts are composed of non-metallic ions. The most common cation in this category is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺).\n    *   The anions must contain nitrogen and oxygen. The two most common are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are likely **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) (Salt A)** and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) (Salt B)**.\n\n4.  **Write and Balance the Decomposition Reactions**\n    Let's write the thermal decomposition reactions for these two salts that would produce the observed products.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** The decomposition can proceed in multiple ways. The reaction that produces N₂, O₂, and H₂O is: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n5.  **Use Stoichiometry and the \"Equimolar\" Condition**\n    The problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles of Salt A and also the number of moles of Salt B.\n\n    Let's calculate the total moles of each product based on the reactions and the initial 'n' moles of each salt:\n    *   **Total Moles of N₂:** n (from A) + (2/2)n (from B) = n + n = **2n**\n    *   **Total Moles of O₂:** 0 (from A) + (1/2)n (from B) = **0.5n**\n    *   **Total Moles of H₂O:** 2n (from A) + (4/2)n (from B) = 2n + 2n = **4n**\n\n    Now we can use the experimental moles calculated in Step 1 to solve for 'n':\n    *   From O₂: 0.025 mol = 0.5n  => n = 0.05 mol\n    *   From N₂: 0.10 mol = 2n      => n = 0.05 mol\n    *   From H₂O: 0.20 mol = 4n      => n = 0.05 mol\n    All calculations consistently give **n = 0.05 mol**. This confirms our identification of the salts and the reactions is correct.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms in the Formulas**\n    The question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of Salt A and Salt B combined.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** It contains 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** It contains 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Total Atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n7.  **Final Answer**\n    The total number of atoms is 17, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental data to identify the decomposition products and their quantities.**\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The mass did not change, which means **no CO₂ was produced**. This tells us that the original salts do not contain carbonate (CO₃²⁻) or oxalate (C₂O₄²⁻) ions.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases like oxygen (O₂) and nitrous oxide (N₂O). The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms transferred to Cu = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The possible reactions are: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO and Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n    *   The 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms could come from O₂ gas, N₂O gas, or a mixture of both.\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Gas C passed through a drying agent, a base, and hot copper, indicating it's an inert gas. Given that the original salts are heated, a common inert product is nitrogen gas (N₂). Let's assume Gas C is N₂.\n    *   The N₂ that exits tube №3 is the sum of any N₂ produced directly from decomposition and any N₂ produced by the reduction of N₂O in tube №3.\n    *   Total moles of N₂ = n(N₂, initial) + n(N₂O, initial) = 0.10 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n\nThe decomposition was done without air, so all elements in the products (H, O, N) must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H) atoms:** From the 0.20 mol of H₂O, we have 2 * 0.20 = **0.40 mol of H atoms**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O) atoms:** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and was transferred to the copper in tube №3.\n    *   Moles of O from H₂O = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Moles of O from tube №3 = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol of O atoms**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N) atoms:** All nitrogen from the original salts ends up as N₂ gas (Gas C).\n    *   From the relationship n(N₂, total) = n(N₂, initial) + n(N₂O, initial) = 0.10 mol.\n    *   The total number of N atoms is 2 * n(N₂, initial) + 2 * n(N₂O, initial) = 2 * [n(N₂, initial) + n(N₂O, initial)] = 2 * 0.10 = **0.20 mol of N atoms**.\n\n**Step 3: Check for mass conservation.**\nLet's calculate the total mass of these elements to see if it matches the initial mass.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol * 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol * 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol * 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total mass = 0.40 + 4.00 + 2.80 = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our calculations of the elemental composition are correct.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the salts A and B.**\n\nThe salts contain only H, N, and O. They are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions, as these are known to decompose upon heating to produce water and nitrogen-containing gases. The most common candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's assume:\n*   Salt A = NH₄NO₂ (Molar mass = 14+4+14+32 = 64 g/mol)\n*   Salt B = NH₄NO₃ (Molar mass = 14+4+14+48 = 80 g/mol)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles of salt A, and 'n' be the number of moles of salt B.\n\nLet's find the total moles of each element in the mixture in terms of 'n':\n*   Total moles of H = (4 from A) * n + (4 from B) * n = 8n\n*   Total moles of N = (2 from A) * n + (2 from B) * n = 4n\n*   Total moles of O = (2 from A) * n + (3 from B) * n = 5n\n\nNow, we equate these expressions with the moles of elements we calculated in Step 2:\n*   For H: 8n = 0.40 mol  => n = 0.05 mol\n*   For N: 4n = 0.20 mol  => n = 0.05 mol\n*   For O: 5n = 0.25 mol  => n = 0.05 mol\n\nAll three calculations yield the same value for n (n = 0.05 mol), which strongly confirms that our identification of salts A and B is correct.\n\nLet's verify this with the total mass:\n*   Total mass = n * M_A + n * M_B = 0.05 mol * 64 g/mol + 0.05 mol * 80 g/mol\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the given initial mass perfectly.\n\n**Step 5: Answer the question.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

We can determine the composition and amount of the gas mixture from the mass changes of these tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is equal to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (filled with Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no gas was absorbed. This means no CO₂ (or other acidic gases like SO₂, NO₂) was present in the gas mixture. Therefore, the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (filled with red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ molecules, the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with the drying agent, the alkaline solution, or the hot copper. Given that we expect the salts to contain nitrogen (a very common component of salts that decompose into gases), the most logical identity for Gas C is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition of the 7.20 g salt mixture produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol N₂\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n\nSince salts A and B decomposed completely into these gases, we can calculate the total moles of each element present in the initial mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All N comes from N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen comes from both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × Moles of H₂O) + (2 × Moles of O₂) = 0.20 mol + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nNow, let's check if the total mass of these elements matches the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches perfectly, confirming our analysis of the products is correct.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The combined empirical formula of the mixture (A+B) has an atomic ratio of H:N:O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25. To get whole numbers, we can multiply by 20, giving a ratio of H:N:O = 8:4:5.\n\nSo, the combined formula of one molecule of salt A plus one molecule of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to find two common salt formulas that add up to this total. The salts are composed of H, N, and O. The most common cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺), and the common anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻). Let's test these.\n\n*   Let Salt A be ammonium nitrite: **NH₄NO₂**. Its chemical formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n*   Let Salt B be ammonium nitrate: **NH₄NO₃**. Its chemical formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n\nLet's sum the formulas of our candidate salts:\n(N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = **N₄H₈O₅**\nThis perfectly matches the overall composition we derived. Thus, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\nWe can verify this with the moles and masses. M(NH₄NO₂) = 64 g/mol, M(NH₄NO₃) = 80 g/mol. Since the mixture is equimolar, let's say we have 'n' moles of each.\nTotal mass = n × M(NH₄NO₂) + n × M(NH₄NO₃) = n × (64 + 80) = 144n.\n144n = 7.20 g → n = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol.\nThe mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃. This is consistent with all the product amounts.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 2 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 3 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total atoms in both salts** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products from the Decomposition.**\n    The problem states that a 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. These gases are then analyzed.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a powerful dehydrating agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The problem states its weight did not change. This is a crucial piece of information: no CO₂ was produced, which means the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube, 0.80 g, is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that have bonded to the copper.\n        *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.00 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since the gas was O₂, each molecule contains two oxygen atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = Moles of O atoms / 2 = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas C remains. The volume is given at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas C and Check Mass Conservation.**\n    We can determine the identity of Gas C by using the law of conservation of mass. The initial mass of the salts must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n    *   Total initial mass = 7.20 g.\n    *   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O₂ produced = Moles of O₂ × Molar mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol × 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Total initial mass - Mass of H₂O - Mass of O₂\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass of C = Mass of C / Moles of C = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n    *   A gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is inert under these conditions is nitrogen (N₂). The presence of nitrogen is also suggested because we are dealing with the decomposition of salts. Therefore, Gas C is N₂.\n\n3.  **Determine the Elemental Composition and Identify the Salts.**\n    The decomposition products are 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂. From this, we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n    *   **Moles of N:** from 0.1 mol N₂ → 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 mol N.\n    *   **Moles of H:** from 0.2 mol H₂O → 0.2 × 2 = 0.4 mol H.\n    *   **Moles of O:** from 0.2 mol H₂O and 0.025 mol O₂ → (0.2 × 1) + (0.025 × 2) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\n    The empirical formula of the entire mixture is N₀.₂H₀.₄O₀.₂₅. To get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20, which gives N₄H₈O₅.\n\n    The problem states we have an *equimolar* mixture of two salts, A and B. This means the sum of the atoms in their chemical formulas must be N₄H₈O₅. We are looking for two common salts containing only N, H, and O that add up to this formula. Ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions are excellent candidates.\n\n    Let's test two likely salts:\n    *   **Ammonium Nitrate:** NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n    *   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\n    Let's sum their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    This perfectly matches the elemental composition we derived from the products.\n\n4.  **Verify with Reaction Stoichiometry and Molar Masses.**\n    Let's check if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these two salts produces the observed molar ratios of products (H₂O : O₂ : N₂ = 0.2 : 0.025 : 0.1 = 8 : 1 : 4).\n    *   Decomposition of NH₄NO₂: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   Decomposition of NH₄NO₃ (at high temp): 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\n    If we start with 'n' moles of each salt, the products are:\n    *   From `n` mol NH₄NO₂: `n` mol N₂ + `2n` mol H₂O\n    *   From `n` mol NH₄NO₃: `n` mol N₂ + `n/2` mol O₂ + `2n` mol H₂O\n    *   Total products: (n+n) mol N₂ + (n/2) mol O₂ + (2n+2n) mol H₂O = `2n` mol N₂ + `0.5n` mol O₂ + `4n` mol H₂O.\n    *   The molar ratio of products is H₂O : O₂ : N₂ = 4n : 0.5n : 2n = 8 : 1 : 4.\n    This matches the experimental ratio, confirming the identities of salts A and B.\n\n    We can also find 'n': from 0.025 mol of O₂, we have `n/2` = 0.025, so n = 0.05 mol.\n    The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n    *   Mass = (0.05 mol × 80.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 64.04 g/mol) = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g. This matches the initial mass.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms.**\n    The final step is to answer the question: \"Indicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\" This means the sum of the atoms in the individual formula units.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nAn equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, undergoes thermal decomposition. The products are analyzed to determine the composition of the original salts.\n\n**1. Analysis of Decomposition Products:**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** The mass of this tube did not change. This indicates that no acidic gases, such as CO₂, were produced. This rules out the presence of carbon in the original salts that could be oxidized to CO₂.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot Cu):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen gas (O₂): 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen gas exists as O₂ molecules, the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through the tubes, 2.24 L of gas C remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   According to Avogadro's law, 1 mole of any gas at STP occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n**2. Identification of Gas C and Mass Conservation:**\n\nThe initial mass of the mixture was 7.20 g. The total mass of the gaseous products must also be 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.025 mol × 32.0 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g\n*   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A diatomic gas that is unreactive with the reagents in the tubes and has a molar mass of 28 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**3. Elemental Composition and Identification of Salts A and B:**\n\nThe decomposition was done without air, so all the elements in the products (N, H, O) must have come from the original salts.\n*   **Total moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.1 mol of N₂ → 2 × 0.1 = 0.2 mol N.\n*   **Total moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.2 mol of H₂O → 2 × 0.2 = 0.4 mol H.\n*   **Total moles of Oxygen (O):** From 0.2 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂ → (1 × 0.2) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O, which strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\n*   The 0.4 mol of H corresponds to 0.1 mol of ammonium ions (NH₄⁺), since each ion has 4 H atoms (0.4 mol H / 4 = 0.1 mol NH₄⁺).\n*   The problem states the mixture is equimolar. If we have n moles of salt A and n moles of salt B, and each contains one ammonium ion, then 2n = 0.1 mol, which means n = 0.05 mol.\n*   The mixture contains 0.05 mol of salt A and 0.05 mol of salt B.\n*   Let's find the anions. The anions must contain the remaining nitrogen and all the oxygen.\n    *   N in anions = Total N - N in NH₄⁺ = 0.2 mol - 0.1 mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   O in anions = Total O = 0.25 mol.\n*   For 0.05 mol of each salt, if the anions are (NₓOᵧ) and (NₐOᵦ), then:\n    *   0.05x + 0.05a = 0.1  =>  x + a = 2\n    *   0.05y + 0.05b = 0.25 =>  y + b = 5\n*   The two most common nitrogen oxyanions are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n    *   If one anion is NO₂⁻ (x=1, y=2) and the other is NO₃⁻ (a=1, b=3):\n        *   x + a = 1 + 1 = 2 (Correct)\n        *   y + b = 2 + 3 = 5 (Correct)\n*   Therefore, the salts are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n*   **Verification by mass:**\n    *   M(NH₄NO₂) = 64 g/mol; Mass = 0.05 mol × 64 g/mol = 3.20 g\n    *   M(NH₄NO₃) = 80 g/mol; Mass = 0.05 mol × 80 g/mol = 4.00 g\n    *   Total Mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given information.\n\n**4.

In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Products from Experimental Data:**\n    *   Tube 1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂): Absorbs H₂O. Mass increase = 3.60 g. Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol H₂O**.\n    *   Tube 2 (Ca(OH)₂): Absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Mass did not change, so no acidic gases were formed. The salts do not contain carbon.\n    *   Tube 3 (Hot Cu): Reacts with O₂. Mass increase = 0.80 g. Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol O₂**.\n    *   Gas C (Remaining gas): Unreactive gas. Volume = 2.24 L at STP. Moles = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**. This gas is most likely N₂.\n\n2.  **Determine the Salts A and B:**\n    *   The products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) indicate the original salts contained only Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n    *   Common salts that fit this description and decompose on heating are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n    *   Decomposition reactions:\n        *   Salt B: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   Salt A: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n    *   The mixture is equimolar, so let `n` be the moles of each salt.\n    *   Total moles of products from `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B:\n        *   Moles O₂ = `n/2` (only from A)\n        *   Moles N₂ = `n` (from A) + `n` (from B) = `2n`\n        *   Moles H₂O = `2n` (from A) + `2n` (from B) = `4n`\n    *   Solve for `n` using the experimental data:\n        *   From O₂: `n/2` = 0.025 mol  => `n` = 0.05 mol\n        *   From N₂: `2n` = 0.10 mol  => `n` = 0.05 mol\n        *   From H₂O: `4n` = 0.20 mol  => `n` = 0.05 mol\n    *   The consistent value of `n` = 0.05 mol confirms the identities of the salts.\n\n3.  **Verify the Total Mass:**\n    *   Mass of A (NH₄NO₃) = 0.05 mol * 80 g/mol = 4.00 g\n    *   Mass of B (NH₄NO₂) = 0.05 mol * 64 g/mol = 3.20 g\n    *   Total Mass = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g.

Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of salts A and B is heated, and the resulting gases are passed through a series of tubes. We can identify the products and their quantities from the changes in the tubes' weights.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The weight increase is 3.60 g. Therefore, mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂).\n    *   The weight did not change. This is a crucial piece of information: **no acidic gases were produced** in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The weight increase is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted. Therefore, mass of O₂ produced = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Gas C did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. The most likely candidate for such an unreactive gas formed from the decomposition of salts is nitrogen (N₂). We will proceed with this assumption.\n\nSo, the decomposition of the 7.20 g mixture yielded:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol N₂\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nSince the salts completely decomposed into gases, we can find the elemental composition of the original mixture by calculating the moles of each element in the products.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All N comes from N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × Moles of H₂O) + (2 × Moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nNow, let's check if the total mass of these elements matches the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1 g/mol = 0.40 g\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 + 2.80 + 4.00 = 7.20 g.\n\nThe calculated mass matches the initial mass of the mixture. This confirms that salts A and B are composed only of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts are made of N, H, and O. This points to ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxoacids. The most common are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nLet's find the overall empirical formula for the mixture. The molar ratio of the elements is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get integers, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nSo, the combined formula of the (A+B) unit from the equimolar mixture is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nNow let's see if our candidate salts fit this combined formula.\n*   Formula of ammonium nitrate (Salt A): NH₄NO₃ → **N₂H₄O₃**\n*   Formula of ammonium nitrite (Salt B): NH₄NO₂ → **N₂H₄O₂**\n\nLet's add them together: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match! Therefore, the two salts are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Verify the Quantities**\n\nLet's confirm this identification by calculating the moles of each salt. The mixture is equimolar, so let 'n' be the moles of each salt.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = n × M(NH₄NO₃) + n × M(NH₄NO₂) = 7.20 g\n*   n × (80 + 64) = 7.20\n*   n × 144 = 7.20\n*   n = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂. The decomposition reactions must be:\n*   Decomposition of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   Products: 0.05 mol N₂ and 2 × 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   This leaves the remaining products to come from the decomposition of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃.\n    *   Remaining N₂ = 0.10 (total) - 0.05 = 0.05 mol\n    *   Remaining H₂O = 0.20 (total) - 0.10 = 0.10 mol\n    *   Remaining O₂ = 0.025 (total) - 0 = 0.025 mol\n*   So, the reaction for ammonium nitrate must be:\n    *   0.05 NH₄NO₃ → 0.05 N₂ + 0.10 H₂O + 0.025 O₂\n    *   Multiplying by 20 gives the molar ratio: 1 NH₄NO₃ → 1 N₂ + 2 H₂O + 0.5 O₂\n    *   Or, balanced with integers: **2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + 4H₂O + O₂**. This is a known decomposition reaction for ammonium nitrate under strong heating.\nEverything is consistent.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to answer the question: \"Indicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\" This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Atoms = 1 N (in NH₄) + 4 H + 1 N (in NO₃) + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Atoms = 1 N (in NH₄) + 4 H + 1 N (in NO₂) + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Mixture Composition**\n\nThe problem describes heating a mixture of two salts, A and B, which decompose entirely into a mixture of gases. This gas mixture is then passed through a series of tubes to identify its components.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of this tube is equal to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = mass / molar mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ (by forming a precipitate, CaCO₃). The problem states the weight of this tube did not change, which means there were no acidic gases like CO₂ in the mixture. This implies the original salts did not contain carbonate (CO₃²⁻) or similar anions.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases. The weight of the tube increased by 0.80 g, and CuO was formed. This increase in mass is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen is 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = mass / atomic mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    The source of this oxygen must be an oxygen-containing gas from the decomposition. Common gases from heating nitrogen-based salts include N₂O (nitrous oxide) and O₂.\n    Let's hypothesize the gas is N₂O. The reaction with copper is: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\n    From the stoichiometry, 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of O atoms to form CuO. Therefore, the amount of N₂O that reacted is 0.05 mol. This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    This final gas C must be chemically inert to all the reagents used. It consists of any inert gas from the original decomposition plus any inert gas formed in the tubes. Following our hypothesis for tube 3, the final gas C (0.10 mol) is composed of the N₂ produced from the N₂O reaction (0.05 mol) and another inert gas that was present from the initial decomposition. The amount of this initial inert gas is 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol. A very likely candidate for this inert gas is N₂ itself.\n\n**2. Determine the Initial Products**\n\nBased on the analysis, the gas mixture produced by heating salts A and B consists of:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe products contain only nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. The salts decompose completely into gases. This strongly suggests that A and B are ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxoacids. Let's consider the thermal decomposition of two common salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let's assume the mixture contains `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B. If A is NH₄NO₂ and B is NH₄NO₃:\n*   Decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ produces `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   Decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ produces `n` moles of N₂O and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\nThe total amounts of products would be:\n*   Total moles of N₂ = `n`\n*   Total moles of N₂O = `n`\n*   Total moles of H₂O = `2n + 2n = 4n`\n\nNow, let's compare this with our derived product amounts:\n*   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol  => `n` = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol => `n` = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of H₂O = 0.20 mol => `4n` = 0.20 => `n` = 0.05 mol\n\nThe results are perfectly consistent. The mixture contained 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Verify the Total Mass**\n\nLet's check if the mass of this mixture matches the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (moles of NH₄NO₂) × (Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂) + (moles of NH₄NO₃) × (Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃)\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass given in the problem.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe salts A and B are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in their chemical formulas).\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\n1.  **Analyze the Products from the Gas Analysis Train:**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This chemical is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced by the decomposition.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This tells us the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen gas (O₂) according to the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   **Gas C:** The remaining gas (2.24 L at STP) is inert to all the previous traps. In the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this gas is almost certainly nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Moles of Each Gaseous Product:**\n    *   **Moles of Water (H₂O):**\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 1.0*2 + 16.0 = 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol H₂O.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O₂):**\n        *   The mass increase (0.80 g) is from oxygen atoms (O). Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol O.\n        *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol O₂.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N₂):**\n        *   At standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n        *   Moles = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n3.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of Salts A and B:**\n    By the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts.\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the water (H₂O). Each H₂O molecule has 2 H atoms.\n        *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol H.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the nitrogen gas (N₂). Each N₂ molecule has 2 N atoms.\n        *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol N.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water (H₂O) and the oxygen gas (O₂).\n        *   Moles of O = (moles of H₂O) + 2 × (moles of O₂) = 0.20 mol + 2 × 0.025 mol = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\n4.  **Verify Composition and Identify the Salts:**\n    *   Let's check if the total mass of these elements equals the starting mass:\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g\n        *   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.8 g\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.0 g\n        *   Total Mass = 0.4 + 2.8 + 4.0 = 7.2 g. This matches the initial mass perfectly.\n    *   The total molar ratio of elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n    *   To get a simple whole number ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20): N₁ : H₂ : O₁.₂₅.\n    *   To eliminate the fraction, multiply all by 4: N₄ : H₈ : O₅.\n    *   This formula, N₄H₈O₅, represents the combined formula of one molecule of salt A and one molecule of salt B (since they are in an equimolar mixture). We must split this into two plausible salt formulas. Common salts containing only N, H, and O are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\n        *   Ammonium Nitrite: NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n        *   Ammonium Nitrate: NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n    *   Let's see if these two add up: (N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\n    *   So, salt A is NH₄NO₂ and salt B is NH₄NO₃.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   Count the atoms in the formula for salt A (NH₄NO₂): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   Count the atoms in the formula for salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   The total number of atoms is the sum of the atoms in both salts: 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nThe problem asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of two salts, A and B. To find this, we first need to identify the chemical composition of salts A and B based on the provided experimental data.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Gas Absorption Data:**\n    *   The gas mixture produced by heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) absorbed.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol H₂O**.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since the mass did not change, no such gases were present in the mixture. This tells us the salts A and B do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This means an oxidizing gas in the mixture transferred its oxygen atoms to the copper.\n        *   Mass of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol O atoms**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Gaseous Products:**\n    *   The elements present must come from the original salts. Since H₂O is produced, the salts contain Hydrogen and Oxygen. The lack of CO₂ and SO₂ rules out C and S. The remaining likely element is Nitrogen, as many nitrogen-containing salts decompose upon heating.\n    *   The gas that reacted with copper was an oxidizing gas. A common product from the decomposition of nitrogen salts is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is: N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂. In this reaction, one mole of N₂O provides one mole of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n    *   Therefore, the 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms came from **0.05 mol of N₂O**. This reaction also produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n    *   **Final Gas (C):** At the end, 2.24 L of an inert gas C remained at STP.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n        *   This inert gas is most likely Nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   The total N₂ at the end (0.10 mol) is the sum of the N₂ produced in Tube №3 (0.05 mol) and any N₂ that was part of the original gas mixture.\n    *   Original N₂ = Total N₂ - N₂ from N₂O reaction = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol N₂**.\n    *   So, the initial mixture of gases formed from heating the salts was:\n        *   0.20 mol H₂O\n        *   0.05 mol N₂O\n        *   0.05 mol N₂\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:**\n    *   We need to find two salts that decompose to yield these products. We are told the initial mixture of salts A and B was equimolar. Let's assume there were `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B.\n    *   Consider the thermal decomposition of common ammonium salts:\n        *   **NH₄NO₂ (Ammonium nitrite) → N₂ + 2H₂O**\n        *   **NH₄NO₃ (Ammonium nitrate) → N₂O + 2H₂O**\n    *   This pair of reactions perfectly matches our identified products. Let's check the stoichiometry.\n    *   Let Salt A be NH₄NO₂ and Salt B be NH₄NO₃. If the mixture is equimolar, `n` = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Decomposition of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ yields: 0.05 mol N₂ and 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n        *   Decomposition of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ yields: 0.05 mol N₂O and 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n    *   The total products are: 0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol H₂O. This perfectly matches our findings from step 2.\n\n4.  **Verify the Initial Mass:**\n    *   Let's check if 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ have a total mass of 7.20 g.\n        *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n        *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n        *   Total Mass = (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This confirms that salts A and B are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n    *   Total number of atoms in salts A and B = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the decomposition products to identify the original salts.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Moles**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (absorbs H₂O):** The mass increased by 3.60 g. This mass corresponds to the water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (absorbs acidic gases like CO₂):** The mass did not change. This is a crucial clue, indicating that no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (reacts with O₂):** The mass increased by 0.80 g. Red-hot copper reacts with oxygen (2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO). The mass gain is equal to the mass of the oxygen (O₂).\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ is 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products must equal the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g) due to the law of conservation of mass.\n*   Total Mass = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n*   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n*   7.20 g = 4.40 g + Mass(Gas C)\n*   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n\nNow we can determine the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass(C) = Mass(C) / Moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol.\nA common, non-acidic gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂). This suggests the original salts were nitrogen compounds.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe decomposition products are N₂, H₂O, and O₂. The original salts A and B must contain only Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. Since they are salts that decompose fully into gases, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. Let's consider the decomposition of ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n*   Ammonium Nitrite: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Ammonium Nitrate: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + 4H₂O(g) + O₂(g) (This decomposition pathway occurs at temperatures around 200-250°C).\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture. Let's assume we have `x` moles of NH₄NO₃ and `x` moles of NH₄NO₂. The balanced reactions for the mixture would be:\n`x` NH₄NO₂(s) → `x` N₂(g) + `2x` H₂O(g)\n`x` NH₄NO₃(s) → `x` N₂(g) + `2x` H₂O(g) + `0.5x` O₂(g)  (dividing the standard equation by 2)\n\nTotal moles of products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = `x` + `x` = `2x`\n*   Total H₂O = `2x` + `2x` = `4x`\n*   Total O₂ = `0.5x`\n\nNow let's compare the molar ratio of the products:\nN₂ : H₂O : O₂ = `2x` : `4x` : `0.5x` = 4 : 8 : 1.\n\nLet's check the experimental ratio from our calculations in step 1:\nN₂ : H₂O : O₂ = 0.10 mol : 0.20 mol : 0.025 mol\nDividing by the smallest value (0.025):\n(0.10/0.025) : (0.20/0.025) : (0.025/0.025) = 4 : 8 : 1.\n\nThe ratios match perfectly. Therefore, the salts A and B are Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n**4. Verify the Initial Mass**\nFrom the product ratios, we know that moles of O₂ = `0.5x`.\n*   0.025 mol = `0.5x`\n*   `x` = 0.05 mol.\nThis means the initial equimolar mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol * 80 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol * 64 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n*   Total Initial Mass = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g. This matches the value given in the problem.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\nNow we can find the total number of atoms in the formulas of the two salts.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of atoms in their respective formulas:\nTotal atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Treatment Process**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced by heating salts A and B is passed through three tubes. We can deduce the composition of the gas mixture by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H2O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H2O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H2O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO2 or SO2, which would form a precipitate (CaCO3 or CaSO3) and increase the mass of the tube. The fact that the mass did not change indicates that no such acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O2) or nitrogen oxides like N2O. The reaction is the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) is 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the reagents used.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   A very common inert gas produced in decomposition reactions of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N2).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nFrom the products, we can determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture. The total mass of the mixture is 7.20 g, which must equal the total mass of the products by the law of conservation of mass.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.2 mol of H2O produced.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 * Moles of H2O = 2 * 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.4 mol * 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H2O and in the oxidizing gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O from H2O = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Moles of O from the oxidizing gas = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol * 16.0 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The only remaining element must be nitrogen, which forms the final unreactive gas C (N2).\n    *   Assuming Gas C is N2, Moles of N atoms = 2 * Moles of N2 = 2 * 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Mass of N = 0.2 mol * 14.0 g/mol = 2.8 g.\n\n*   **Mass Check:** Total mass of elements = Mass(H) + Mass(O) + Mass(N) = 0.4 g + 4.0 g + 2.8 g = 7.2 g. This matches the initial mass of the salt mixture, confirming our elemental analysis.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts A and B are composed of H, N, and O. They are in an equimolar mixture. Let `n` be the number of moles of salt A and `n` be the number of moles of salt B. The entire sample consists of `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n\nFrom our elemental analysis, the `n(A) + n(B)` mixture contains:\n*   0.4 mol H atoms\n*   0.2 mol N atoms\n*   0.25 mol O atoms\n\nThe combined formula for one unit of A and one unit of B must have an atom ratio of H : N : O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25. To get integers, we multiply by 20, giving a ratio of 8 : 4 : 5.\nSo, the combined chemical formula of (A + B) is **H8N4O5**.\n\nWe need to find two common nitrogen- and oxygen-containing salts (likely ammonium salts of oxoacids) that add up to this formula. Let's consider:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH4NO2): Formula is H4N2O2.\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3): Formula is H4N2O3.\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(H4N2O2) + (H4N2O3) = H8N4O5.\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, we can identify Salt A as **NH4NO2** and Salt B as **NH4NO3** (or vice versa).\n\n**4. Verify the Hypothesis with Decomposition Reactions**\n\nLet's check if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these salts matches the observed products.\n*   `NH4NO2(s) -> N2(g) + 2H2O(g)`\n*   `NH4NO3(s) -> N2O(g) + 2H2O(g)`\n\nIf we heat `n` moles of each salt:\n*   Products: `n` moles of N2, `n` moles of N2O, and (2n + 2n) = `4n` moles of H2O.\n\nNow, let's trace these gases through the tubes:\n1.  **Tube 1:** Absorbs `4n` moles of H2O. From step 1, we know this is 0.2 mol. So, `4n = 0.2` => `n = 0.05` mol.\n2.  Gases leaving Tube 1 are `n` mol N2 and `n` mol N2O (i.e., 0.05 mol N2 and 0.05 mol N2O).\n3.  **Tube 2:** No reaction.\n4.  **Tube 3:** The oxidizing gas N2O reacts: `N2O + Cu -> N2 + CuO`.\n    *   0.05 mol of N2O reacts, consuming 0.05 mol of O atoms (Mass = 0.05*16 = 0.80 g). This matches the mass increase of the tube.\n    *   This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N2.\n5.  **Final Gas C:** The final gas is the initial N2 (0.05 mol) plus the N2 produced from N2O (0.05 mol). Total N2 = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.1 mol. This matches the moles of Gas C.\n\nAll calculations are consistent with A = NH4NO2 and B = NH4NO3, and n = 0.05 mol.\nA final check on mass: M(NH4NO2)=64 g/mol, M(NH4NO3)=80 g/mol.\nTotal Mass = 0.05 mol * (64 + 80) g/mol = 0.05 * 144 = 7.2 g. This is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH4NO2):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms (N)\n    *   4 Hydrogen atoms (H)\n    *   2 Oxygen atoms (O)\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH4NO3):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms (N)\n    *   4 Hydrogen atoms (H)\n    *   3 Oxygen atoms (O)\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nAlternatively, we found the combined formula for (A+B) is H8N4O5. The total number of atoms is 8 (H) + 4 (N) + 5 (O) = 17.\n\nThe correct answer is 17.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThe problem is solved by analyzing the products of the decomposition to identify the composition of the original salts.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe gas mixture from the decomposition was passed through a series of tubes, and the mass changes were recorded.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The weight did not change, so no acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase is due to the oxygen consumed.\n    *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO\n    *   Mass increase = Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n**2. Identification of Gas C and the Original Elements**\n\n*   By the Law of Conservation of Mass, the total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n    *   Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g\n    *   3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g\n    *   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 - 4.40 = 2.80 g.\n*   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass(C) = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A gas that is unreactive under these conditions with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**3. Determination of the Empirical Formula and Identity of the Salts**\n\n*   Since the products are N₂, O₂, and H₂O, the original salts A and B must contain Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O) atoms. Let's find the total moles of each element in the initial mixture.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × Moles(H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Total moles of N = 2 × Moles(N₂) = 2 × 0.1 = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O = (1 × Moles(H₂O)) + (2 × Moles(O₂)) = 0.2 + (2 × 0.025) = 0.25 mol.\n*   The molar ratio of elements in the combined salts (A+B) is N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, multiply by 20:\n    *   N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5.\n*   So, the combined formula of one mole of salt A plus one mole of salt B (as they are an equimolar mixture) is N₄H₈O₅.\n*   Given that these are salts formed from N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxoanions. The 8 hydrogen atoms strongly suggest the presence of two ammonium ions (2 x NH₄⁺), which account for N₂H₈.\n*   The remaining part, for the anions, is N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\n*   Two common anions that sum to N₂O₅ are the nitrite ion (NO₂⁻) and the nitrate ion (NO₃⁻).\n*   Thus, the salts are:\n    *   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n    *   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\n**4. Verification**\nLet's check the decomposition reactions.\n*   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   At 200°C, a relevant decomposition for ammonium nitrate is: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n*   The python code execution confirms that a mixture of 0.05 mol of each salt has a total mass of 7.20 g. Let's check the products from these amounts:\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: 0.05 mol N₂ and 0.1 mol H₂O.\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio): 0.05 mol N₂, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol H₂O.\n    *   **Total products:** 0.1 mol N₂, 0.2 mol H₂O, and 0.025 mol O₂. This perfectly matches our initial calculations.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B combined.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   **Total atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental results to determine the composition of the gaseous products.**\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such gases were produced. This suggests the salts do not contain carbon.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** This tube reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass gain is from oxygen atoms.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms captured = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen must come from an oxidizing gas in the mixture. Two main scenarios are possible:\n        *   **Scenario A:** The oxidizing gas is O₂. The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, we need 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol of O₂ gas.\n        *   **Scenario B:** The oxidizing gas is N₂O. The reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, we need 0.05 mol of N₂O gas. This reaction would also produce 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas (C):** 2.24 L of gas C at standard temperature and pressure (STP) remained.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all the reagents. Nitrogen (N₂) is the most likely candidate.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total elemental composition of the initial mixture.**\n\nLet's evaluate both scenarios to see if they are consistent.\n\n*   **Scenario A:** The products are 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂ (Gas C).\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × n(H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × n(N₂) = 2 × 0.1 = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (1 × n(H₂O)) + (2 × n(O₂)) = (1 × 0.2) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Let's check the total mass:\n        *   Mass = (0.4 mol H × 1 g/mol) + (0.2 mol N × 14 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16 g/mol)\n        *   Mass = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass of the mixture perfectly.\n\n*   **Scenario B:** The products are 0.2 mol H₂O and 0.05 mol N₂O. The 0.1 mol of remaining gas is N₂. However, the reduction of N₂O also produces N₂. The total N₂ (0.1 mol) is the sum of the N₂ initially present and the N₂ produced from N₂O.\n    *   n(N₂ from N₂O) = n(N₂O) = 0.05 mol.\n    *   n(N₂ initial) = Total n(N₂) - n(N₂ from N₂O) = 0.1 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, the decomposition products are: 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × n(H₂O) = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = (2 × n(N₂O)) + (2 × n(N₂)) = (2 × 0.05) + (2 × 0.05) = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (1 × n(H₂O)) + (1 × n(N₂O)) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   This yields the exact same elemental composition as Scenario A, which also sums to 7.20 g.\n\nBoth scenarios are consistent with the data and lead to the same conclusion: the 7.20 g mixture contains **0.4 mol H, 0.2 mol N, and 0.25 mol O**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify salts A and B.**\n\nThe salts contain only H, N, and O, and decompose fully into gases. This strongly points to ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids, specifically ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nThe decomposition reactions are:\n*   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   A common high-temperature decomposition of ammonium nitrate is: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\nThe problem states the mixture of salts A and B is equimolar. Let's assume we have *n* moles of each salt.\nIf A = NH₄NO₂ and B = NH₄NO₃:\n*   *n* NH₄NO₂ produces *n* mol N₂ and 2*n* mol H₂O.\n*   *n* NH₄NO₃ produces *n* mol N₂ + (n/2) mol O₂ + 2*n* mol H₂O (based on the 2:2:1:4 ratio).\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Total O₂ = n/2\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n\nNow we match this with our findings from Scenario A: n(N₂) = 0.1 mol, n(O₂) = 0.025 mol, n(H₂O) = 0.2 mol.\n*   From O₂: n/2 = 0.025  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**.\n*   Check N₂: Total N₂ = 2n = 2 × 0.05 = 0.1 mol. (Matches)\n*   Check H₂O: Total H₂O = 4n = 4 × 0.05 = 0.2 mol. (Matches)\n\nThe identification is correct. We have an equimolar mixture of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of atoms in the salts.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the formula units of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nThis is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem.\n\n**1. Identify and Quantify the Products**\n\nThe problem states that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B is heated, and the resulting gases are passed through a series of tubes. We analyze the mass change in each tube to identify the products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This chemical is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = 3.60 g. This is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol H₂O**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The mass did not change, which means **no acidic gases** were formed. This rules out salts containing carbon (carbonates, oxalates) or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase is from the oxygen.\n    *   Mass increase = 0.80 g. This is the mass of O₂ produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of O₂ ≈ 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol O₂**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After the other gases were removed, a final gas C remained.\n    *   Volume at STP = 2.24 L.\n    *   The molar volume of any ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol of Gas C**.\n\n**2. Identify Gas C and Verify Conservation of Mass**\n\nThe elements in the products (H, O, and the element(s) in Gas C) must have come from the original salts A and B. Since no acidic gases were formed, the most likely candidate for a stable, unreactive gas produced from a salt is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nLet's assume Gas C is N₂ and check if the mass is conserved:\n*   Mass of N₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(N₂) = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = **7.20 g**.\nThis perfectly matches the initial mass of the mixture. Our product identification is correct.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts are composed of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. These are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. The most common ones are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃). Let's check their decomposition reactions.\n\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite: **NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)**\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate at ~200°C: **2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + 4H₂O(g) + O₂(g)**\n\nThis matches our observed products: N₂, H₂O, and O₂.\nLet 'n' be the number of moles for each salt in the equimolar mixture.\n\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ we get: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ we get: `n` moles of N₂, `2n` moles of H₂O, and `0.5n` moles of O₂.\n\nNow, let's sum the products and compare them to our experimental results:\n*   Total O₂ produced = `0.5n`. We measured 0.025 mol. So, `0.5n = 0.025 mol`, which gives **`n = 0.05` mol**.\n*   Let's check this value with the other products:\n    *   Total N₂ = `n` (from nitrite) + `n` (from nitrate) = `2n` = 2 × 0.05 = **0.10 mol**. This matches our calculation.\n    *   Total H₂O = `2n` (from nitrite) + `2n` (from nitrate) = `4n` = 4 × 0.05 = **0.20 mol**. This also matches.\n\nThe salts A and B are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question is to find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in A and B** = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products of Decomposition:**\n    The problem describes the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gas mixture is analyzed by passing it through three tubes.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful desiccant (drying agent). It absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a limewater test. A milky precipitate (CaCO₃) would form if acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂ were present. Since the weight did not change, no such gases were formed. This implies the original salts do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO) via the reaction `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`. The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen consumed.\n        *   Mass increase = Mass of O = 0.80 g.\n        *   Wait, the reaction shows the mass increase is the mass of O₂, not just O. Let's re-examine. `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`. The tube contains copper initially. The mass *increase* is the mass of the other reactant, which is O₂.\n        *   Okay, wait. Let's think carefully. If we have a tube of copper, and we pass O₂ through it, the copper turns into CuO. The mass of the *tube's contents* increases. The increase is the mass of the oxygen that has become part of the solid CuO. So the 0.80 g increase is the mass of atomic oxygen, not diatomic oxygen gas.\n        *   Let's check the wording again: \"the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3)\". This phrasing usually means the mass of the absorbed/reacted substance. For red-hot copper, it reacts with O₂ gas. The mass increase of the *copper* itself is the mass of oxygen atoms. So, mass of O is 0.80g.\n            *   Moles of O from this source = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol. This came from O₂ gas, so Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol. This is consistent.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After the first three steps, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to the reagents used.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume at STP / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n        *   Given the elements likely present (H, O from H₂O and O₂), and the fact that we're dealing with decomposing salts, a very common inert gaseous product is Nitrogen (N₂). Let's assume Gas C is N₂.\n\n2.  **Determine Elemental Composition of the Original Salts:**\n    Since the products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂, the original salts must be composed of Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O). Let's calculate the total moles of each element in the 7.20 g mixture.\n\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the H₂O.\n        *   Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n        *   Mass of H = 0.4 mol × 1.008 g/mol ≈ 0.4 g.\n\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the N₂.\n        *   Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n        *   Mass of N = 0.2 mol × 14.01 g/mol ≈ 2.8 g.\n\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the produced H₂O and from the O that reacted with copper (which came from O₂ gas).\n        *   Moles of O from H₂O = 1 × Moles of H₂O = 0.2 mol.\n        *   Moles of O that reacted with Cu = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Total moles of O = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.00 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n\n3.  **Verify the Composition and Identify the Salts:**\n    *   **Total Mass Check:** Mass(H) + Mass(N) + Mass(O) = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.2 g. This matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our analysis.\n    *   **Find the Salt Formulas:** We have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Let's say we have `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n        *   The overall ratio of atoms in the mixture is H : N : O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25.\n        *   To get integers, multiply by 20: 8 : 4 : 5.\n    *   This H₈N₄O₅ represents the total atoms from one formula unit of salt A plus one formula unit of salt B. We are looking for two common salts made of H, N, and O that add up to this composition.\n    *   These salts are typically ammonium salts of oxyacids of nitrogen. Let's consider Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n        *   Chemical formula of NH₄NO₂ is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n        *   Chemical formula of NH₄NO₃ is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n    *   Let's check if the sum of their atoms matches our ratio:\n        *   Total H = 4 (from N₂H₄O₂) + 4 (from N₂H₄O₃) = 8. (Matches)\n        *   Total N = 2 (from N₂H₄O₂) + 2 (from N₂H₄O₃) = 4. (Matches)\n        *   Total O = 2 (from N₂H₄O₂) + 3 (from N₂H₄O₃) = 5. (Matches)\n    *   The identification is successful. Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃ (or vice-versa).\n\n4.  **Answer the Question:**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in the chemical formula unit of each salt.\n\n    *   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n        *   Number of atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n\n    *   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n        *   Number of atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n\n    *   **Total atoms in both salts** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nThe Python code executed previously confirmed this calculation by taking the same logical steps and computing the total atoms from the identified formulas (N₂H₄O₂ and N₂H₄O₃). The output `17` is correct.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup and results.**\n    The mixture of gases from the heated salts is passed through a series of tubes to identify and quantify the components.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since the weight did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This implies the salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper. Therefore, the mass of O₂ gas produced is 0.80 g.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** The gas that does not react in any of the tubes remains. We have 2.24 L of this gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of each product.**\n    *   **Moles of H₂O:**\n        Molar mass of H₂O = 2(1.01) + 16.00 = 18.02 g/mol.\n        Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Moles of O₂:**\n        Molar mass of O₂ = 2(16.00) = 32.00 g/mol.\n        Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Moles of Gas C:**\n        At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        Moles of C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas C.**\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the gaseous products must equal the initial mass of the salts.\n    *   Total mass = mass(H₂O) + mass(O₂) + mass(C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + mass(C)\n    *   mass(C) = 7.20 - 3.60 - 0.80 = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now, we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n        Molar Mass (C) = mass(C) / moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A diatomic gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is Nitrogen (N₂), since the molar mass of N is ~14 g/mol (2 * 14.01 = 28.02 g/mol).\n\n4.  **Determine the total elemental composition of the salts.**\n    The salts A and B must contain all the atoms found in the products (H, O, N), as nothing else was added.\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 0.20 mol H₂O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) = 0.40 mol H.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N) atoms:** 0.10 mol N₂ × (2 mol N / 1 mol N₂) = 0.20 mol N.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O) atoms:** (0.20 mol H₂O × 1 mol O/mol) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 mol O/mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\n5.  **Identify Salts A and B.**\n    The initial mixture contained an equimolar amount of salt A and salt B. Let `n` be the moles of A and `n` be the moles of B. The total atomic composition we found above (0.4 mol H, 0.2 mol N, 0.25 mol O) is distributed between `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n\n    Let's find the ratio of atoms in the combined \"formula unit\" of (A + B).\n    Ratio: H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25\n    To get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20:\n    Ratio: H : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5\n\n    So, the combination of one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B must contain a total of 8 H atoms, 4 N atoms, and 5 O atoms.\n\n    The salts are formed from H, N, and O. Common salts of this type are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxoacids. The ammonium ion is NH₄⁺.\n    *   Let's see if we can construct the salts using the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺), which contains 1 N and 4 H.\n    *   Our total H atom count is 8. This corresponds exactly to two ammonium ions (2 × 4 H = 8 H).\n    *   This implies that each salt, A and B, contains one ammonium ion:\n        *   Salt A = NH₄(Anion_A)\n        *   Salt B = NH₄(Anion_B)\n    *   Now let's account for the remaining atoms. We have used 2 N atoms and 8 H atoms.\n        *   Remaining N atoms = 4 (total) - 2 (in NH₄⁺ ions) = 2 N atoms.\n        *   Remaining O atoms = 5 (total) - 0 = 5 O atoms.\n    *   These remaining 2 N and 5 O atoms must make up the two anions (Anion_A and Anion_B). Common nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n    *   Let's check if they fit:\n        *   Nitrite (NO₂⁻) has 1 N and 2 O.\n        *   Nitrate (NO₃⁻) has 1 N and 3 O.\n    *   Total atoms from these two anions: (1+1) N and (2+3) O = 2 N and 5 O. This is a perfect match.\n\n    Therefore, the two salts are:\n    *   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n    *   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n6.  **Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in their formula units).\n    *   Number of atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Number of atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nFinal check of the mass:\nMolar Mass(NH₄NO₂) = 64.05 g/mol\nMolar Mass(NH₄NO₃) = 80.05 g/mol\nLet's find the number of moles `n` from the product data. Based on the decomposition 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O (or 1 NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + ½O₂ + 2H₂O), the 0.025 mol of O₂ must have come from `n` moles of NH₄NO₃, where 0.5*n = 0.025, so n = 0.05 moles.\nLet's check the mass with n = 0.05 mol:\nTotal Mass = 0.05 mol × (64.05 g/mol) + 0.05 mol × (80.05 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis confirms our calculations.\n\nThe total number of atoms in the formula units of salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nThe step-by-step reasoning has been laid out, and all calculations have been performed and verified.\n\n1.  **Analyze Products from Mass Changes:**\n    *   The mass increase in tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂) is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n        *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   The weight of tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂) did not change, indicating the absence of acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The mass increase in tube №3 (hot copper) is due to oxygen binding to form CuO.\n        *   Mass of Oxygen = 0.80 g.\n        *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol. This oxygen must have come from an oxidizing gas.\n    *   The remaining gas C is 2.24 L at STP.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol. Since it is inert to all the previous reagents, it is very likely Nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Determine Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture:**\n    *   The total mass of the gaseous products is the sum of the mass of water, the mass of oxygen that reacted, and the mass of the final gas C. Let's first determine the mass of gas C. Since we concluded it's N₂, its molar mass is 28 g/mol. Mass of Gas C = 0.1 mol * 28 g/mol = 2.8 g.\n    *   Let's check for conservation of mass. Total mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O that reacted with Cu) + Mass(Gas C before reacting) is tricky. It's better to work with the elemental masses from the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n    *   **Mass of Hydrogen:** From 0.2 mol of H₂O, moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol. Mass = 0.4 mol × 1 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n    *   **Mass of Oxygen:** From 0.2 mol of H₂O (0.2 mol O atoms) and 0.05 mol O atoms that reacted with Cu. Total moles of O atoms = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol. Mass = 0.25 mol × 16 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n    *   **Mass of Nitrogen:** The salts must be composed of H, N, and O. Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.4 g - 4.0 g = 2.8 g. Moles of N atoms = 2.8 g / 14 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n3.  **Identify the Salts A and B:**\n    *   The original mixture contained 0.4 mol H, 0.2 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n    *   The molar ratio of H:N is 0.4:0.2, which is 2:1. A combination of ammonium salts (NH₄⁺) gives a H:N ratio of 4:2 or 2:1, which fits perfectly. The salts are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   Let the salts be NH₄NOₓ and NH₄NOᵧ.\n    *   The mixture is equimolar, meaning moles of A = moles of B = n.\n    *   From the moles of Nitrogen: n(moles N in A) + n(moles N in B) = n(2) + n(2) = 4n = 0.2 mol N atoms. This gives n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   From the moles of Hydrogen: n(4) + n(4) = 8n = 0.4 mol H atoms. This gives n = 0.05 mol. The values are consistent.\n    *   From the moles of Oxygen: n(x) + n(y) = n(x+y) = 0.05(x+y) = 0.25 mol O atoms.\n    *   Solving for (x+y): x+y = 0.25 / 0.05 = 5.\n    *   The two most common stable nitrogen oxyanions are nitrite (NO₂⁻, so x=2) and nitrate (NO₃⁻, so y=3). 2 + 3 = 5.\n    *   Therefore, salt A is ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and salt B is ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Atoms:**\n    *   Atoms in one formula unit of salt A (NH₄NO₂): 2(N) + 4(H) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in one formula unit of salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2(N) + 4(H) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   The total number of atoms in salts A and B is the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each.\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Moles**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases is produced and passed through a series of tubes. We can identify the components of the gas mixture from the effects on these tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The mass of this tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO): 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, limewater, or hot copper. The most common unreactive gas produced from the decomposition of salts is nitrogen (N₂). Let's assume Gas C is N₂ and verify this with a mass balance check.\n\n**2. Verify Mass Conservation and Determine Elemental Composition**\n\nThe initial mass of the salt mixture was 7.20 g. By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the gaseous products must also be 7.20 g.\n\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ (assuming C is N₂) = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.1 mol × 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly. Our identification of the products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) and their quantities is correct. Now we can determine the total moles of each element in the original salts.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × n(H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Moles of N = 2 × n(N₂) = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in both H₂O and O₂. Moles of O = (1 × n(H₂O)) + (2 × n(O₂)) = (1 × 0.2) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nSo, the original 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B contained 0.4 mol of H, 0.2 mol of N, and 0.25 mol of O.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe are told the mixture is equimolar, meaning n(A) = n(B). Let's call this number of moles 'x'.\nThe elements present (H, N, O) and the fact that they are salts suggest they could be ammonium salts of oxygen-containing anions. Let's assume both salts contain the ammonium cation (NH₄⁺).\n\n*   Salt A = NH₄⁺X⁻\n*   Salt B = NH₄⁺Y⁻\n\nTotal moles of H atoms in the mixture = (moles of NH₄⁺ in A) × 4 + (moles of NH₄⁺ in B) × 4 = (x × 4) + (x × 4) = 8x.\nFrom our product analysis, we know the total moles of H is 0.4.\n*   8x = 0.4 mol  =>  x = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, we have 0.05 mol of salt A and 0.05 mol of salt B. Now let's determine the composition of the anions X and Y.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):**\n    *   Total N required = 0.2 mol.\n    *   N from the NH₄⁺ cations = (moles of NH₄⁺ in A) + (moles of NH₄⁺ in B) = x + x = 2x = 2(0.05) = 0.1 mol.\n    *   The remaining N must come from the anions: N(anions) = 0.2 - 0.1 = 0.1 mol.\n    *   Let Nₓ and Nᵧ be the number of N atoms per anion in X and Y. Then: (0.05 × Nₓ) + (0.05 × Nᵧ) = 0.1 => Nₓ + Nᵧ = 2.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):**\n    *   Total O required = 0.25 mol.\n    *   The NH₄⁺ cation contains no oxygen. All oxygen comes from the anions.\n    *   Let Oₓ and Oᵧ be the number of O atoms per anion in X and Y. Then: (0.05 × Oₓ) + (0.05 × Oᵧ) = 0.25 => Oₓ + Oᵧ = 5.\n\nWe need to find two common nitrogen-oxygen anions, X and Y, such that the total number of nitrogen atoms is 2 and the total number of oxygen atoms is 5.\nLet's consider the common anions nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n\n*   For NO₂⁻: N=1, O=2\n*   For NO₃⁻: N=1, O=3\n\nIf we set X = NO₂⁻ and Y = NO₃⁻:\n*   Total N atoms = N(NO₂⁻) + N(NO₃⁻) = 1 + 1 = 2. (This matches)\n*   Total O atoms = O(NO₂⁻) + O(NO₃⁻) = 2 + 3 = 5. (This also matches)\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: NH₄NO₂ (Ammonium nitrite)**\n*   **Salt B: NH₄NO₃ (Ammonium nitrate)**\n\nLet's do a final check with the total mass:\n*   M(NH₄NO₂) = 14.01×2 + 1.01×4 + 16.00×2 = 64.06 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol × 64.06 g/mol = 3.203 g.\n*   M(NH₄NO₃) = 14.01×2 + 1.01×4 + 16.00×3 = 80.06 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol × 80.06 g/mol = 4.003 g.\n*   Total Mass = 3.203 g + 4.003 g = 7.206 g. This matches the given 7.20 g.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 N in NH₄⁺ + 1 N in NO₂⁻ = 2 Nitrogen atoms\n    *   4 H in NH₄⁺ = 4 Hydrogen atoms\n    *   2 O in NO₂⁻ = 2 Oxygen atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 N in NH₄⁺ + 1 N in NO₃⁻ = 2 Nitrogen atoms\n    *   4 H in NH₄⁺ = 4 Hydrogen atoms\n    *   3 O in NO₃⁻ = 3 Oxygen atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the gaseous products and their quantities.**\n\nThe problem states that a 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B is heated and decomposes entirely into a mixture of gases. These gases are then analyzed.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube, 0.80 g, is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to the reagents used.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition products are: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original mixture.**\n\nThe atoms in the products must have come from the original salts A and B. Let's calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Moles of N = 2 × moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in both H₂O and O₂. Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the conservation of mass.**\n\nLet's calculate the total mass of the elements found and see if it matches the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Total mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly, confirming our analysis of the products is correct.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the salts A and B.**\n\nThe problem states we have an **equimolar mixture** of A and B. Let's say we have 'n' moles of A and 'n' moles of B. The total elemental composition of the mixture (2n moles of salt) is 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe ratio of elements in the combined formulas of (A + B) is:\nH : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20), which gives H:N:O = 2 : 1 : 1.25. Multiplying by 4 to clear the decimal gives:\n**H : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5**\n\nThis means that one formula unit of salt A plus one formula unit of salt B must contain 8 Hydrogen atoms, 4 Nitrogen atoms, and 5 Oxygen atoms.\n\nThe fact that the salts decompose completely into gases at 200°C strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxyanions. Let's test candidates:\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n\nLet's check if the sum of their formulas matches our derived ratio:\n(N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis perfectly matches the elemental ratio of N:H:O = 4:8:5. Therefore, salts A and B are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\nWe can also verify the number of moles.\n*   Mass of (NH₄NO₂ + NH₄NO₃) = M(N₂H₄O₂) + M(N₂H₄O₃) = 64.0 g/mol + 80.0 g/mol = 144.0 g/mol for the pair.\n*   Total mass of mixture = n × (M_A + M_B) = n × 144.0 g/mol = 7.20 g\n*   n = 7.20 / 144.0 = 0.05 mol.\n*   So the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃. This is consistent with our product analysis.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe final question is for the total number of atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   N: 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₂⁻) = 2 atoms\n    *   H: 4 atoms\n    *   O: 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   N: 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₃⁻) = 2 atoms\n    *   H: 4 atoms\n    *   O: 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B)**\n    *   Total = 8 + 9 = **17**\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Treatment and Determine Products**\n\nThe mixture of salts A and B is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g. This means 3.60 g of H₂O was produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change. This implies that no acidic gases like CO₂ were formed during the decomposition. Therefore, the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. It can also react with nitrogen oxides like N₂O (Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂).\n    *   The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that combined with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of oxygen (O) ≈ 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all these reactions, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, limewater, or hot copper. This indicates it is an inert gas. Given that the original substances are salts likely containing nitrogen (as many salts do), the most probable identity for gas C is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBased on the products, we can calculate the total moles of each element (H, N, O) in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and was absorbed by the copper.\n    *   Moles of O in H₂O = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Moles of O reacted with Cu = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass in the original mixture must be nitrogen.\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass of H - Mass of O\n    *   Mass of N = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Atomic mass of N ≈ 14 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of N = 2.80 g / 14 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n**3. Deduce the Formulas of Salts A and B**\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Let's say there are `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B. The total elemental composition is 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe ratio of the elements in the combined mixture is:\nH : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25\nTo get simple integers, we can multiply by 20:\nH : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5\n\nThis means that for every `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B, the total number of atoms corresponds to the formula H₈N₄O₅. We need to split this \"combined formula\" into two plausible salt formulas.\n\nSince they are salts, they consist of a cation and an anion.\n*   The H₈N₄ portion strongly suggests two ammonium cations (NH₄⁺), which would account for N₂H₈²⁺.\n*   This leaves a remaining \"anion part\" of N₂O₅, which must be split between two anions with a total charge of 2-.\n*   The common anions of nitrogen and oxygen are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   Let's see if they fit: NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ = [N₂O₅]²⁻. This is a perfect match for the remaining atoms and the required charge.\n\nTherefore, the two salts must be:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n\n**(Self-Consistency Check):** Let's verify this. If we have n=0.05 moles of each salt (total moles N = n*(2+2) = 4n = 0.2 => n=0.05), the mass would be 0.05*M(NH₄NO₃) + 0.05*M(NH₄NO₂). M(NH₄NO₃) = 80 g/mol, M(NH₄NO₂) = 64 g/mol. Total mass = 0.05 * (80 + 64) = 0.05 * 144 = 7.2 g. This matches perfectly. The decomposition reactions NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O and NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O also produce quantities that exactly match all the experimental data.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in their chemical formulas).\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B**\n    *   Total = 9 + 8 = 17\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products from the Experimental Data**\n\n    *   The mixture of salts A and B weighs 7.20 g and decomposes upon heating into only a mixture of gases.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H2O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H2O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H2O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** This is used to absorb acidic gases (e.g., CO2, SO2, NO2, N2O). Since its weight did not change, no such gases were formed.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Copper at high temperatures reacts with oxygen (O2) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The weight increase of 0.80 g corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Molar mass of O2 = 32 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O2 = 0.80 g / 32 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remained at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\n    *   The total mass of the gaseous products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n    *   Mass of products = mass(H2O) + mass(O2) + mass(C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + mass(C)\n    *   mass(C) = 7.20 - 4.40 = 2.80 g.\n    *   We can now calculate the molar mass of gas C:\n        *   Molar Mass(C) = mass(C) / moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol.\n    *   A common gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that does not react with the absorbents is nitrogen (N2). So, **Gas C is N2**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\n    *   The products of the decomposition are N2, H2O, and O2. Therefore, the original salts A and B must be composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n    *   Let's find the total moles of each element in the products, which must equal the total moles in the initial salt mixture:\n        *   **Moles of H atoms:** 0.20 mol H2O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H2O) = 0.4 mol H.\n        *   **Moles of N atoms:** 0.10 mol N2 × (2 mol N / 1 mol N2) = 0.2 mol N.\n        *   **Moles of O atoms:** (0.20 mol H2O × 1 O) + (0.025 mol O2 × 2 O) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\n4.  **Identify Salts A and B**\n\n    *   The problem states it is an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Let's find the overall empirical formula of the combined salts.\n    *   The mole ratio of the elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25.\n    *   To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20: (0.2 * 20) : (0.4 * 20) : (0.25 * 20) = 4 : 8 : 5.\n    *   So, the combined formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is **N4H8O5**.\n    *   We need to partition these atoms into two plausible salts that decompose into gases. Since the salts contain N and H, they are likely ammonium salts.\n    *   The H8 suggests the presence of two ammonium cations, `(NH4)2+`, which would account for N2H8.\n    *   The remaining atoms are `N4H8O5 - N2H8 = N2O5`. These atoms must form the two anions of the salts.\n    *   The common oxyanions of nitrogen are nitrite (NO2⁻) and nitrate (NO3⁻).\n    *   Let's check if they fit: `NO2⁻ + NO3⁻ = N2O5²⁻`. This perfectly matches the remaining atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are formed by combining one `NH4⁺` with `NO2⁻` and the other `NH4⁺` with `NO3⁻`.\n        *   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2)**\n        *   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3)**\n\n5.  **Verify the Decomposition and Stoichiometry**\n\n    *   Let's check if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these two salts yields the observed products. At the given temperature and conditions, plausible reactions are:\n        *   `NH4NO2 -> N2 + 2H2O`\n        *   `2NH4NO3 -> 2N2 + O2 + 4H2O` (A decomposition pathway for NH4NO3 that yields N2 and O2).\n    *   If we start with `n` moles of NH4NO2 and `n` moles of NH4NO3 (equimolar):\n        *   From `n` mol NH4NO2: produces `n` mol N2 and `2n` mol H2O.\n        *   From `n` mol NH4NO3: produces `n` mol N2, `n/2` mol O2, and `2n` mol H2O.\n    *   Total Moles of Products:\n        *   Total N2 = `n + n = 2n`\n        *   Total H2O = `2n + 2n = 4n`\n        *   Total O2 = `n/2`\n    *   The ratio of products is `N2 : H2O : O2` = `2n : 4n : n/2`, which simplifies to `4 : 8 : 1`.\n    *   Let's check the ratio from our experimental data:\n        *   `n(N2) : n(H2O) : n(O2)` = `0.10 : 0.20 : 0.025`. Dividing by 0.025 gives the ratio `4 : 8 : 1`.\n    *   The ratios match perfectly, confirming our identification of the salts is correct.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n    *   **Salt A (NH4NO2):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH4NO3):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nThis is a classic stoichiometry and qualitative analysis problem. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the salts and solve the question.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products\n\nThe initial mixture of salts A and B weighs 7.20 g and decomposes upon heating to form only gaseous products. We can identify these gases and their quantities by analyzing their journey through the tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This substance is a strong desiccant and absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol H₂O**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, or NO₂. The problem states that the weight of this tube did not change.\n    *   This is a crucial clue: **No acidic gases were formed.** This implies that the original salts do not contain elements like Carbon or Sulfur, or if they contain Nitrogen, it doesn't form acidic oxides like NO₂.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases, primarily oxygen (O₂) or nitrous oxide (N₂O).\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper to form copper(II) oxide (CuO).\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen atom (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms absorbed = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol O**.\n    *   If the gas was O₂, the moles of O₂ would be 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   If the gas was N₂O (reacting as Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂), the moles of N₂O would be 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, limewater, or hot copper. This indicates it is a relatively inert gas. Given the elements we're likely dealing with (see next step), this gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Deducing the Identity of the Salts\n\nNow we determine the total elemental composition of the products to figure out the composition of the original salts. The salts must only contain elements that form the identified products (H₂O, N₂, and an oxygen-containing gas) and do not leave a solid residue. This suggests the salts are composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). Salts that decompose completely into gases are typically ammonium salts of oxygen-containing anions.\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the gas reacting with copper is N₂O, as the decomposition of ammonium nitrate at 200°C typically produces N₂O and H₂O.\n\n**Hypothesis:** The products are H₂O, N₂, and N₂O. Salts A and B are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   **Decomposition reactions:**\n    *   Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite): NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)\n    *   Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate): NH₄NO₃ (s) → N₂O (g) + 2H₂O (g)\n\nLet's assume the initial equimolar mixture contains `x` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `x` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n1.  **Water (H₂O):** According to the reactions, `x` mol of NH₄NO₂ produces `2x` mol of H₂O, and `x` mol of NH₄NO₃ produces `2x` mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total H₂O produced = `2x + 2x = 4x`.\n    *   From our analysis, we know 0.20 mol of H₂O was produced.\n    *   `4x = 0.20 mol` ⇒ `x = 0.05 mol`.\n    *   So, the initial mixture contained **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂** and **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃**.\n\n2.  **Gases passed to Tube №3:** The gases entering the copper tube would be `x` moles of N₂ (from NH₄NO₂) and `x` moles of N₂O (from NH₄NO₃). With `x=0.05`, that's 0.05 mol N₂ and 0.05 mol N₂O.\n\n3.  **Reaction in Tube №3:** The N₂O reacts with the hot copper: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\n    *   `0.05 mol` of N₂O reacts, transferring `0.05 mol` of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n    *   Mass of oxygen = 0.05 mol * 16.0 g/mol = **0.80 g**. This exactly matches the experimental data.\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas C:** The final gas is the N₂ that was initially present plus the N₂ formed from the decomposition of N₂O.\n    *   Total N₂ = (N₂ from NH₄NO₂) + (N₂ from N₂O) = `x + x = 2x`.\n    *   Total moles of N₂ = 2 * 0.05 mol = **0.10 mol**. This exactly matches the amount of Gas C calculated from its volume.\n\n5.  **Initial Mass Verification:** Let's check if the mass of 0.05 mol of each salt equals 7.20 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Total Mass = (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = **7.20 g**. This also perfectly matches the initial data.\n\nOur hypothesis is confirmed. The salts A and B are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to answer the question: \"Indicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\" This means summing the atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the experimental data from the gas treatment**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases, most notably carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight did not change, it means no CO₂ (or other acidic gases like SO₂) was produced during the decomposition. This implies the salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This increase is purely due to the mass of oxygen atoms from an oxidizing gas in the mixture.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the reagents used.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **2. Determine the composition of the initial gas mixture**\n\nFrom step 1, we know the initial salts decomposed to produce a mixture of gases containing H₂O, N₂, and an oxidizing gas containing nitrogen and/or oxygen. Let's determine the identity and quantity of the oxidizing gas.\n\n*   The oxidizing gas contains 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms. Plausible candidates from the decomposition of nitrogen-based salts include O₂, N₂O, or NO.\n*   The temperature of decomposition is 200°C. This is a key piece of information for identifying the likely decomposition products of common salts.\n*   Let's consider the common thermal decomposition of ammonium salts:\n    *   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O (This reaction occurs between 170°C and 240°C).\n    *   At higher temperatures (>250°C), NH₄NO₃ can decompose differently: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O.\n*   Given the temperature of 200°C, the formation of N₂O from ammonium nitrate is the most likely reaction. This suggests our oxidizing gas is N₂O.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n*   If the oxidizing gas is nitrous oxide (N₂O), we need 0.05 mol of N₂O to provide 0.05 mol of O atoms.\n*   The reaction in tube №3 with hot copper is: N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂.\n*   This means 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted, producing 0.05 mol of N₂ gas inside tube №3.\n*   The final collected gas (Gas C) is 0.10 mol of N₂. This gas consists of any N₂ that entered tube №3 plus the N₂ produced from the N₂O reaction.\n    *   Total N₂ = (N₂ that entered) + (N₂ produced from N₂O)\n    *   0.10 mol = (N₂ that entered) + 0.05 mol\n    *   Solving for the amount of N₂ that entered, we get: (N₂ that entered) = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the mixture of gases produced by heating the salts was:\n*   **0.20 mol H₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol N₂O** (the oxidizing gas)\n*   **0.05 mol N₂** (the initial inert gas)\n\n### **3. Verify with Mass Conservation and Identify Salts A and B**\n\nLet's check if the total mass of these gaseous products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of H₂O = 0.20 mol * 18.0 g/mol = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of N₂O = 0.05 mol * 44.0 g/mol = 2.20 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.05 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 1.40 g\n*   **Total mass = 3.60 g + 2.20 g + 1.40 g = 7.20 g.**\nThis perfectly matches the initial mass. Our identification of the product mixture is correct.\n\nNow, we must find two salts, A and B, which are in an equimolar mixture and decompose to give this specific set of products.\n*   The products 0.05 mol N₂ and 0.2 mol H₂O (0.1 mol H₂O from each source) correspond perfectly to the decomposition of:\n    *   **0.05 mol of Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):**\n        0.05 NH₄NO₂(s) → 0.05 N₂(g) + 0.1 H₂O(g)\n    *   **0.05 mol of Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):**\n        0.05 NH₄NO₃(s) → 0.05 N₂O(g) + 0.1 H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states an equimolar mixture (0.05 mol of each) was used. This scenario fits all the data. Therefore:\n*   **Salt A is NH₄NO₂**\n*   **Salt B is NH₄NO₃**\n\n### **4. Calculate the total number of atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in salts A and B** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the products and calculate their amounts (moles).**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases is formed and passed through three tubes, and a final gas C remains. Let's analyze each step:\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong desiccant, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The problem states the weight of this tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were present in the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`. The weight increase of the tube is equal to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Gas C:** This is the gas that remained after passing through all three tubes. It is inert to water absorption, basic solutions, and hot copper.\n    *   Volume of Gas C = 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify Gas C and verify the law of conservation of mass.**\n\nThe total initial mass of the salt mixture was 7.20 g. This must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n\nNow we can determine the identity of Gas C by calculating its molar mass:\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   The molar mass of 28.0 g/mol corresponds to nitrogen gas (N₂). This also fits the chemical profile of being relatively inert.\n\nSo, the decomposition products are: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n**3. Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n\nLet's find the total moles of each element (N, H, O) present in the products, which must equal the moles of elements in the original salts A and B.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O, moles of H = 2 × 0.20 = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol of N₂, moles of N = 2 × 0.10 = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂, moles of O = (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nSo, the initial 7.20 g mixture contained 0.40 mol of H, 0.20 mol of N, and 0.25 mol of O.\n\n**4. Identify salts A and B.**\n\n*   The fact that the salts decompose completely into gaseous products at a relatively low temperature (200°C) strongly suggests they are ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-based oxyanions.\n*   Let's check if the cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺). The total moles of H atoms is 0.40 mol. If the cation is NH₄⁺, the total moles of NH₄⁺ ions would be 0.40 mol H / 4 H per ion = 0.10 mol.\n*   This 0.10 mol of NH₄⁺ ions would contribute 0.10 mol of N atoms. The total N atoms are 0.20 mol, so the remaining 0.10 mol of N must come from the anions.\n*   The total O atoms (0.25 mol) must also come from the anions.\n*   We have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total number of moles of salt is equal to the total moles of the cation, which is 0.10 mol. Since the mixture is equimolar:\n    *   Moles of salt A = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Moles of salt B = 0.05 mol.\n*   Now, let's find the formulas of the two anions. The 0.05 mol of anion A and 0.05 mol of anion B must together contain 0.10 mol of N and 0.25 mol of O. Let the anions be (NₓOᵧ)⁻ and (NₐOᵦ)⁻.\n    *   For Nitrogen: (0.05 mol × x) + (0.05 mol × a) = 0.10 mol N ⇒ x + a = 2.\n    *   For Oxygen: (0.05 mol × y) + (0.05 mol × b) = 0.25 mol O ⇒ y + b = 5.\n*   The most common nitrogen oxyanions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻). Let's see if they fit.\n    *   For nitrate (NO₃⁻): one N and three O atoms (x=1, y=3).\n    *   For nitrite (NO₂⁻): one N and two O atoms (a=1, b=2).\n    *   Check: x + a = 1 + 1 = 2. (Correct)\n    *   Check: y + b = 3 + 2 = 5. (Correct)\n*   Thus, the two salts are Ammonium Nitrate and Ammonium Nitrite.\n    *   **Salt A = NH₄NO₃**\n    *   **Salt B = NH₄NO₂**\n\n**5. Verify the initial mass.**\n\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14+4(1)+14+3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14+4(1)+14+2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 × 80 = 4.00 g.\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 × 64 = 3.20 g.\n*   Total mass = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g. This matches the initial weight perfectly.\n\n**6. Calculate the total number of atoms in salts A and B.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n*   Number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A (NH₄NO₃) = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n*   Number of atoms in one formula unit of salt B (NH₄NO₂) = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n*   Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the gaseous products and their quantities from the experimental data.**\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of this tube is equal to the mass of water produced by the decomposition.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases, most notably carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the mass of this tube did not change, no acidic gases like CO₂ were produced. This implies that the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: Hot copper acts as a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, which means the copper was oxidized. This is typically a reaction with O₂ or another oxygen-containing oxidizing gas like N₂O. The mass increase of the copper tube is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that have chemically bonded to the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   The molar mass of atomic oxygen is 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas C**: This is the gas that did not get absorbed or react in the previous three tubes. Its volume is given at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Volume of Gas C = 2.24 L.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n\nThe total mass of the products must equal the mass of the reactants (7.20 g). Let's calculate the mass of the elements in the gaseous products.\n*   Mass of Hydrogen = Moles(H₂O) * 2 * Molar Mass(H) = 0.20 mol * 2 * 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n*   Mass of Oxygen = Moles(H₂O) * 1 * Molar Mass(O) + Moles(O atoms) * Molar Mass(O) = 0.20 mol * 16.0 g/mol + 0.05 mol * 16.0 g/mol = 3.20 g + 0.80 g = 4.00 g.\n*   The remaining mass must belong to the element(s) that make up Gas C. Total mass = Mass(H) + Mass(O) + Mass(C_element) = 7.20 g.\n*   Mass(C_element) = 7.20 g - 0.4 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n\nGas C is inert to the reagents used. Nitrogen gas (N₂) is the most plausible candidate, especially from heating nitrogen-containing salts. Let's check if this fits.\n*   If Gas C is N₂, its molar mass is 28.0 g/mol.\n*   Mass of 0.10 mol N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\nThis perfectly matches the remaining mass. Therefore, the original salts A and B are composed only of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n**Step 3: Propose the identities of salts A and B.**\n\nSince salts A and B are composed of N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of oxyacids of nitrogen. The most common ones are:\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n\nLet's hypothesize that A and B are these two salts. We are told the mixture is equimolar, meaning moles(A) = moles(B) = n.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the hypothesis with the reaction stoichiometry.**\n\nLet's consider the thermal decomposition reactions for these salts around 200°C.\n*   **NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)**\n*   **NH₄NO₃ (s) → N₂O (g) + 2H₂O (g)**\n\nIn this scenario, the initial gas mixture from decomposing n moles of each salt would be:\n*   H₂O: 2n (from nitrite) + 2n (from nitrate) = 4n mol\n*   N₂: n mol (from nitrite)\n*   N₂O: n mol (from nitrate)\n\nNow, let's trace these gases through the tubes:\n1.  **Tube 1:** Absorbs 4n moles of H₂O.\n2.  **Tube 2:** N₂ and N₂O pass through unreacted.\n3.  **Tube 3:** The oxidizing gas N₂O reacts with hot copper: **N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO**. This reaction consumes n moles of N₂O and adds n moles of oxygen atoms to the copper tube.\n4.  **Final Gas C:** The final gas is the N₂ from the nitrite decomposition (n mol) plus the N₂ from the N₂O reaction (n mol). Total moles of Gas C = n + n = 2n.\n\nNow let's match this stoichiometry with our experimental mole calculations:\n*   Moles of H₂O = 4n = 0.20 mol  =>  n = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of O atoms = n = 0.05 mol  =>  n = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of Gas C = 2n = 0.10 mol  =>  n = 0.05 mol\n\nAll three results consistently give **n = 0.05 mol**. This confirms that the mixture contains 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\n**Step 5: Final verification with total mass.**\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 80.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64.0 g/mol) = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass given in the problem. The identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**Step 6: Answer the question.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in their chemical formulas).\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe total number of atoms in both salts combined is 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nThe problem has been solved correctly in the previous steps. Here is a summary of the logical procedure leading to the final answer.\n\n**1. Data Analysis:**\n*   **Tube 1 (H₂O absorber):** Mass increased by 3.60 g. This means 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol of H₂O** was produced.\n*   **Tube 2 (Acidic gas absorber):** No mass change, so no acidic gases (CO₂, SO₂, NO₂) were formed. The salts do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n*   **Tube 3 (Reacts with O₂/N₂O):** Mass increased by 0.80 g. This is the mass of oxygen atoms transferred to the copper. Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol of O atoms**.\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 L at STP. This inert gas is N₂. Moles = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol of N₂**.\n\n**2. Reconstructing the Decomposition Products:**\n*   The oxidizing gas that reacted in Tube 3 must have been N₂O, as it's a common decomposition product and isn't acidic. The reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n*   To provide 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms, **0.05 mol of N₂O** must have reacted. This reaction also produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   The total 0.10 mol of N₂ collected at the end is the sum of N₂ from the original decomposition plus the 0.05 mol of N₂ from the N₂O reaction.\n*   Therefore, the original decomposition must have produced 0.10 - 0.05 = **0.05 mol of N₂**.\n*   In summary, the thermal decomposition produced: **0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.**\n\n**3. Determining the Elemental Composition:**\n*   From the products, we can find the total moles of each element in the original salt mixture.\n    *   **Moles H:** 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 = **0.40 mol H**\n    *   **Moles N:** (0.05 mol N₂ × 2) + (0.05 mol N₂O × 2) = **0.20 mol N**\n    *   **Moles O:** (0.20 mol H₂O × 1) + (0.05 mol N₂O × 1) = **0.25 mol O**\n\n**4. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms:**\n*   The mole ratio of elements in the combined salts (A+B) is H:N:O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25.\n*   To get the simplest whole-number ratio for the atoms in a combined formula unit of (A+B), we multiply by 20:\n    H: (0.40 × 20) = 8\n    N: (0.20 × 20) = 4\n    O: (0.25 × 20) = 5\n*   The combined formula representing one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **H₈N₄O₅**.\n*   The total number of atoms is the sum of the subscripts: 8 + 4 + 5 = **17**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Reaction Products from Experimental Data**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of salts A and B is heated, and the resulting gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes. We can deduce the composition of the gas mixture from the changes in the tubes' weights.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol H₂O**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The problem states its weight did not change, which means **no CO₂ was produced**. This rules out carbonates, oxalates, or other salts that would decompose to form CO₂.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The weight of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This means an oxidizing gas reacted with the copper, and the 0.80 g mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol O**.\n    *   Common oxidizing gases that decompose from salts are O₂ and N₂O. If the gas was O₂, its moles would be `moles(O)/2` = 0.05/2 = **0.025 mol O₂**. If the gas was N₂O, its moles would be `moles(O)` = **0.05 mol N₂O**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert under the given conditions.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   This inert gas is almost certainly **Nitrogen (N₂) **, a common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n### **2. Determine the Overall Composition and Identify Salts**\n\nLet's check the mass balance. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\nTotal mass = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(N₂) + Mass(oxidizing gas).\n\n*   Let's assume the oxidizing gas is **O₂**.\n    *   Mass H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Mass O₂ = 0.025 mol * 32.0 g/mol = 0.80 g\n    *   Mass N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n    *   Total Mass = 3.60 + 0.80 + 2.80 = **7.20 g**.\n    *   This perfectly matches the initial mass. This confirms that the products are **0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂**.\n\nNow we need to find two salts, A and B, in an equimolar mixture, that produce these products in this ratio upon heating. Ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions are the most likely candidates. Let's consider **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite:**\n    NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate (at ~200-250°C):**\n    2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + 4H₂O(g) + O₂(g)\n    *Note: Decomposition of NH₄NO₃ can also produce N₂O, but the mass balance pointed us to O₂ as the product.*\n\nLet the mixture contain `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ (equimolar).\nLet's calculate the total moles of products:\n*   **Total O₂:** Only comes from NH₄NO₃. From the balanced equation, `n` mol of NH₄NO₃ produces `n/2` mol of O₂.\n    *   We know 0.025 mol of O₂ was formed. So, `n/2 = 0.025` mol => **`n = 0.05` mol**.\n\nThis means the mixture contained 0.05 mol of salt A and 0.05 mol of salt B. Let's verify the amounts of the other products with `n=0.05`:\n*   **Total N₂:**\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: `n` = 0.05 mol N₂\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃: `n` = 0.05 mol N₂\n    *   Total N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = **0.10 mol**. This matches our data.\n\n*   **Total H₂O:**\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: `2n` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃: `2n` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O\n    *   Total H₂O = 0.10 + 0.10 = **0.20 mol**. This also matches our data.\n\nThe identification of salts A and B as **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** is correct.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to sum the number of atoms in the chemical formulas of both salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both salts** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThe result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products of the Reaction:**\n    The problem states that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B is heated, producing a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through a series of tubes, and the change in weight of the tubes tells us what gases were produced and in what quantities.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O).\n        *   The weight increase is 3.60 g. Therefore, the mass of H₂O produced is 3.60 g.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n        *   The weight of this tube did not change. This is a crucial piece of information: **no CO₂ was produced**. This rules out salts containing carbonate (CO₃²⁻) or oxalate (C₂O₄²⁻) ions.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n        *   The weight increase is due to the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Mass of oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O is 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since the gas is molecular oxygen (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas C and Verify Conservation of Mass:**\n    The total mass of the starting salts (7.20 g) must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.025 mol × 32.0 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂)\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass of C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   The most common gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that would be produced from heating salts is nitrogen gas (N₂), with M ≈ 14.01 × 2 = 28.02 g/mol. This is also consistent with the fact that no carbon was detected (no CO₂). So, **Gas C is N₂**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture:**\n    The atoms in the product gases (H₂O, O₂, N₂) must have come from the original salts A and B. We can calculate the total moles of each element.\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Moles(H) = 2 × Moles(H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Moles(N) = 2 × Moles(N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** O is in H₂O and O₂. Moles(O) = Moles(O in H₂O) + Moles(O in O₂) = 0.20 mol + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n    So, the 7.20 g mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O. The mole ratio is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives N₈H₄O₅, which is wrong. N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25 -> 20:40:25 -> simplified by 5 gives **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n4.  **Identify Salts A and B:**\n    We have an equimolar mixture of A and B. Let's say there are `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n    *   The total chemical formula of the `n`(A+B) mixture that was heated is N₀.₂₀H₀.₄₀O₀.₂₅.\n    *   This means the formula of one \"unit\" of (A+B) is proportional to N₄H₈O₅.\n    *   The molar mass of a N₄H₈O₅ unit is 4(14.01) + 8(1.008) + 5(16.00) ≈ 56 + 8 + 80 = 144 g/mol.\n    *   The total mass of the mixture is `n` × (Molar Mass of A + Molar Mass of B).\n    *   If the formula of (A+B) is N₄H₈O₅, then M(A)+M(B) = 144 g/mol.\n    *   The amount of this combined unit is `n` = Total Mass / Combined Molar Mass = 7.20 g / 144 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, the mixture consists of **0.05 mol of salt A** and **0.05 mol of salt B**.\n\n    Now we need to find two salts, A and B, whose formulas add up to N₄H₈O₅ and are consistent with the problem's conditions (decomposing to gas, no C, etc.).\n    *   The presence of nitrogen and hydrogen suggests ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts. The H₈ in the combined formula N₄H₈O₅ suggests two NH₄⁺ ions (2 × 4 = 8 H).\n    *   Let's try splitting N₄H₈O₅ into two common ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   Candidate salts: Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n    *   Let's check their formulas:\n        *   NH₄NO₃ -> **N₂H₄O₃**\n        *   NH₄NO₂ -> **N₂H₄O₂**\n    *   Sum of formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Let's check their molar masses:\n        *   M(NH₄NO₃) = 80.0 g/mol\n        *   M(NH₄NO₂) = 64.0 g/mol\n    *   Sum of molar masses: 80.0 + 64.0 = **144.0 g/mol**. This also matches perfectly.\n\n    Thus, the salts A and B are **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their individual chemical formulas.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total atoms** = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the gas treatment process to identify the products of the decomposition.**\n    1.  The mixture of gases is first passed through a tube with anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂, which is a strong desiccant that absorbs water. The mass of this tube increased by 3.60 g. This means the mass of water (H₂O) produced is 3.60 g.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n    2.  Next, the remaining gases are passed through a Ca(OH)₂ solution. This solution absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The mass of this tube did not change, which implies that no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition of the salts.\n\n    3.  Then, the gases are passed through a tube with red-hot copper. Copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g. This increase is equal to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.80 g.\n        *   The gas must have been O₂. Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are 0.05 mol atoms / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n    4.  Finally, 2.24 liters of a remaining gas C were collected at standard temperature and pressure (STP). At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n        *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the identity of Gas C and the total composition of the gas mixture.**\n    *   The total mass of the initial salts was 7.20 g. By the law of conservation of mass, this must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n    *   Total Mass = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   7.20 g = 4.40 g + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   We can now find the molar mass of Gas C:\n        *   Molar Mass(Gas C) = Mass(Gas C) / Moles(Gas C) = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n    *   A gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is unreactive towards Ca(OH)₂ and hot copper is most certainly Nitrogen (N₂).\n\n*   **Step 3: Summarize the decomposition products.**\n    *   H₂O: 0.2 mol\n    *   O₂: 0.025 mol\n    *   N₂: 0.1 mol\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the salts A and B.**\n    *   The products are H₂O, N₂, and O₂. This indicates the salts are composed of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. Since they are salts that decompose upon heating, ammonium salts of oxyanions are likely candidates.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that the salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n        *   Decomposition of ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n        *   Decomposition of ammonium nitrate (strong heating): 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n    *   The mixture of salts A and B is equimolar. Let 'n' be the moles of each salt.\n        *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01 + 4*1.01 + 14.01 + 2*16.00 = 64.04 g/mol.\n        *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01 + 4*1.01 + 14.01 + 3*16.00 = 80.05 g/mol.\n    *   The total mass of the mixture is 7.20 g:\n        *   n * M(NH₄NO₂) + n * M(NH₄NO₃) = 7.20 g\n        *   n * (64.04 + 80.05) = 7.20 g\n        *   n * (144.09) = 7.20 g\n        *   n = 7.20 / 144.09 ≈ 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, we have 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃. Let's see if this produces the correct amount of gas.\n        *   From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂:\n            *   N₂ produced = 0.05 mol\n            *   H₂O produced = 2 * 0.05 mol = 0.1 mol\n        *   From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃:\n            *   Using the 2:2:1:4 ratio for the reaction 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O:\n            *   N₂ produced = (2/2) * 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n            *   O₂ produced = (1/2) * 0.05 mol = 0.025 mol\n            *   H₂O produced = (4/2) * 0.05 mol = 0.1 mol\n    *   Total products:\n        *   Total N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.1 mol. (Matches our finding)\n        *   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol. (Matches our finding)\n        *   Total H₂O = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 mol. (Matches our finding)\n    *   The hypothesis is correct. The salts A and B are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each.\n    *   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemistry problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of the Decomposition**\n\nThe problem states that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 g, is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. This gas mixture is then passed through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase is 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 2(1.0) + 16.0 = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, etc.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change, meaning no acidic gases were formed in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxidizing agents, most commonly oxygen (O₂). The problem states CuO is formed (2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO). The increase in mass is due to the oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   The mass increase is 0.80 g, which corresponds to the mass of O₂ produced.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2 * 16.0 = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   Note: Hot copper also reacts with nitrous oxide (N₂O) via Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. If N₂O were produced, the mass increase would still correspond to the mass of oxygen atoms, and it would produce N₂ gas. We will consider this later.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nLet's check the total mass of the products identified so far.\n*   Total initial mass = 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n*   From the law of conservation of mass, we can find the mass of Gas C:\n    Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂)\n    Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Now we can determine the molar mass of Gas C:\n    Molar Mass(Gas C) = Mass(Gas C) / Moles(Gas C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that is unreactive towards Ca(OH)₂ is nitrogen (N₂). So, **Gas C is N₂**.\n\n**3. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Reactants**\n\nSince the salts decomposed completely into H₂O, O₂, and N₂, the original salts A and B must be composed only of Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O).\nLet's calculate the total moles of each element in the products, which must equal the moles in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n*   **Moles of H atoms:** From 0.20 mol of H₂O, we have 2 × 0.20 = **0.40 mol H**.\n*   **Moles of N atoms:** From 0.10 mol of N₂, we have 2 × 0.10 = **0.20 mol N**.\n*   **Moles of O atoms:** From 0.20 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂, we have (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol O**.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe reactants are salts composed of N, H, and O. This strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. The most common ones are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂). Let's test this hypothesis.\n*   Let Salt A = **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) -> Formula: N₂H₄O₂**\n*   Let Salt B = **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) -> Formula: N₂H₄O₃**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let `n` be the number of moles of Salt A and `n` be the number of moles of Salt B.\nThe total moles of each element in the initial mixture are:\n*   Total moles of N = (2 N per formula A) × n + (2 N per formula B) × n = 2n + 2n = **4n**\n*   Total moles of H = (4 H per formula A) × n + (4 H per formula B) × n = 4n + 4n = **8n**\n*   Total moles of O = (2 O per formula A) × n + (3 O per formula B) × n = 2n + 3n = **5n**\n\nNow we equate these expressions with the moles of elements we calculated from the products:\n*   For N: 4n = 0.20 mol => n = 0.05 mol\n*   For H: 8n = 0.40 mol => n = 0.05 mol\n*   For O: 5n = 0.25 mol => n = 0.05 mol\n\nAll three calculations yield **n = 0.05 mol**. This is a consistent result, confirming our hypothesis.\n\n**5. Final Check with Initial Mass**\n\nLet's check if the mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ equals the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.0+4(1.0)+14.0+2(16.0) = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.0+4(1.0)+14.0+3(16.0) = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (n × M(A)) + (n × M(B)) = (0.05 mol × 64.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.0 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly. Our identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17 atoms**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

    "Here is a detailed reasoning analysis to determine the most consistent answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Experimental Results**\n\nThe problem involves heating an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, and analyzing the resulting gases. We can deduce the products from the changes in the tubes they pass through.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a desiccant, absorbing water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, for detecting acidic gases like CO₂. The mass did not change, so **no acidic gases were produced**. This implies the original salts do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This means an oxidizing gas reacted with the copper. The mass increase is the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   Atomic mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   The two most plausible scenarios for the oxidizing gas are O₂ or N₂O. Both scenarios are consistent with the subsequent calculations. For simplicity, we can interpret this as 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms being present in the gas mixture after the water was removed.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** 2.24 L of an inert gas remain at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nAll the atoms in the gaseous products must have originated from the 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Total moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol H**.\n*   **Total moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in the water and the oxidizing gas.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Moles(O in H₂O) + Moles(O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol O**.\n*   **Total moles of Nitrogen (N):** The only remaining element to account for the total mass must be nitrogen, which makes up the inert gas C.\n    *   Let's check the mass balance. Mass(H) = 0.40g; Mass(O) = 4.00g.\n    *   Remaining mass = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**.\n    *   If this is nitrogen (Molar mass N ≈ 14.0 g/mol), then moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol N**.\n    *   If this nitrogen ended up as N₂ gas, it would form 0.20 / 2 = 0.10 mol of N₂, which perfectly matches the quantity of Gas C.\n*   Therefore, the 7.20 g mixture contained 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe mixture is equimolar. Let's find the combined formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B. The ratio of moles of atoms is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20, which gives N₄H₈O₅.\n\nWe need to find two common, thermally unstable salts containing N, H, and O that sum to this formula. The most likely candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\n*   Let's test **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**, with the formula N₂H₄O₃.\n*   And **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **, with the formula N₂H₄O₂.\n\nSumming the formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match. Thus, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Calculation of Total Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis result is derived consistently across the majority of the provided candidate solutions.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe overwhelming majority of correct reasoning paths lead to the numerical answer of 17.

Deconstruction of the Experimental Setup**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gas mixture is analyzed by passing it through a series of reactive tubes. Let's analyze the function of each tube to identify the products of the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent. Its mass increase is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O absorbed = 3.60 g.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change. This is a crucial piece of information: it tells us that **no acidic gases were formed** during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper, Cu):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, which means the gas contained oxygen atoms. The mass increase of the tube corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of oxygen atoms (O) gained = 0.80 g.\n    *   The molar mass of an oxygen atom is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen most likely came from O₂ gas (in which case moles of O₂ = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol) or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** The gas that did not react in any of the tubes.\n    *   Volume of gas C = 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since this gas is inert to a strong dehydrating agent, a base, and hot copper, it is almost certainly nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Determining the Composition of the Salts**\n\nFrom the products (H₂O, N₂, and an oxygen source), we can deduce that the original salts A and B must be composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). Let's calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the 0.10 mol of N₂. Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and in the gas that reacted with copper. Moles of O = (moles in H₂O) + (moles reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet's check if the mass of these elements adds up to the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 + 2.80 + 4.00 = 7.20 g.\nThe calculated mass matches the given mass, confirming our analysis.\n\n**3. Identifying Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. Common salts with these elements are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids, such as ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains an equal number of moles ('n') of salt A and salt B.\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the salts are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃.\n*   Salt A: NH₄NO₂ (contains 2 N, 4 H, 2 O)\n*   Salt B: NH₄NO₃ (contains 2 N, 4 H, 3 O)\n\nLet's check if the total elemental moles match our findings for an equimolar mixture of these two salts.\n*   Total moles of H = n × (4) + n × (4) = 8n. We found 0.40 mol of H. So, 8n = 0.40  => n = 0.05 mol.\n*   Total moles of N = n × (2) + n × (2) = 4n. We found 0.20 mol of N. So, 4n = 0.20  => n = 0.05 mol.\n*   Total moles of O = n × (2) + n × (3) = 5n. We found 0.25 mol of O. So, 5n = 0.25  => n = 0.05 mol.\n\nAll calculations consistently give n = 0.05 mol. This confirms that the equimolar mixture consists of 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrite and 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrate.\n\nThe decomposition reactions that produce the observed products are:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n**4. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two identified salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental data from the gas treatment.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, etc. The fact that its weight did not change means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition of the salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is equal to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen must have come from an oxygen-containing gas that is not H₂O (removed in tube 1) and not acidic (did not react in tube 2). Plausible candidates are O₂ or a neutral oxide of nitrogen like N₂O.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, an alkaline solution, or hot copper. This strongly suggests it is a non-reactive gas, most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B decomposed entirely into the gas mixture. By the law of conservation of mass, the mass and elemental composition of the salts must equal the mass and elemental composition of the gaseous products.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.2 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.4 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O reacted with Cu) = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen, as the products (H₂O, N₂, and an oxygen source like N₂O or O₂) are composed only of H, O, and N.\n    *   Mass of N = Total mass - Mass of H - Mass of O = 7.20 g - 0.4 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n**3. Identify the chemical formulas of salts A and B.**\n\nWe have the total elemental molar content of the equimolar mixture of A and B: N(0.2 mol), H(0.4 mol), O(0.25 mol).\nLet's find the ratio of atoms in the combined formula (A + B):\nN : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\nSo, the combined empirical formula for an equimolar amount of A and B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe problem states A and B are salts. The presence of N, H, and O, and the decomposition into gases suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen acids.\n*   The ammonium ion is NH₄⁺.\n*   Common nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n\nWe need to partition the total formula N₄H₈O₅ into two salt formulas, A and B, which are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\nSince we need a total of 8 hydrogen atoms, and the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺) has 4, it is logical to assume each salt contains one ammonium ion.\n*   Salt A = NH₄⁺X⁻\n*   Salt B = NH₄⁺Y⁻\n\nThis accounts for N₂H₈ in total. The remaining atoms to be distributed between the anions X⁻ and Y⁻ are:\nN₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅\nSo, the combined formula of the two anions is X⁻ + Y⁻ = N₂O₅.\nThe most logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable anions is:\n*   Anion X⁻ = NO₃⁻\n*   Anion Y⁻ = NO₂⁻\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃** (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂** (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\nLet's check if the sum of their formulas matches our derived total: N₂H₄O₃ + N₂H₄O₂ = N₄H₈O₅. It matches perfectly.\n\n*(Self-consistency check: The decomposition of 1 mole of NH₄NO₂ gives N₂ + 2H₂O. The decomposition of 1 mole of NH₄NO₃ at ~200°C gives N₂O + 2H₂O. An equimolar mixture would produce N₂, N₂O, and H₂O. N₂O would be the gas that oxidizes the hot copper, and N₂ would be the final inert gas C. This is fully consistent with our analysis.)*\n\n**4. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This is interpreted as the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe total number of atoms is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the reaction and identify the products.**\n\n*   An equimolar mixture of salts A and B (total mass = 7.20 g) is heated and decomposes completely into a gas mixture. This means no solid residue is left.\n*   The gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes:\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong desiccant that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The mass of the tube did not change, which means **no CO₂ was produced**. This implies the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot Copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of O₂ that reacted.\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all these steps, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n\n**2. Calculate the moles of each product.**\n\n*   **Moles of H₂O:**\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol H₂O\n\n*   **Moles of O₂:**\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol O₂\n\n*   **Moles and identity of Gas C:**\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol Gas C.\n    *   We can find the mass of Gas C by the law of conservation of mass:\n        *   Mass of Gas C = Total initial mass - Mass of H₂O - Mass of O₂\n        *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g\n    *   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n        *   Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A diatomic gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂). This makes sense, as many nitrogen-containing salts decompose to produce N₂ gas.\n\nSo, the decomposition products are: **0.20 mol H₂O**, **0.025 mol O₂**, and **0.10 mol N₂**.\n\n**3. Determine the composition of the original salts.**\n\nThe salts A and B must contain the elements found in the products: Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N).\n\nLet's find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of H:** 0.20 mol H₂O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) = 0.40 mol H\n*   **Moles of N:** 0.10 mol N₂ × (2 mol N / 1 mol N₂) = 0.20 mol N\n*   **Moles of O:** (0.20 mol H₂O × 1) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nWe are looking for two salts (A and B) containing H, N, and O that decompose on heating to give H₂O, O₂, and N₂. Ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids are likely candidates. Let's consider:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂): Decomposes as NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃): At higher temperatures (~250-300°C), it can decompose as 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the mixture consists of **NH₄NO₂ (Salt A)** and **NH₄NO₃ (Salt B)**. Since the mixture is equimolar, let's say it contains 'n' moles of each salt.\n\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: `n` mol N₂ and `2n` mol H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: `n` mol N₂ + `0.5n` mol O₂ + `2n` mol H₂O.\n\nTotal moles of products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n*   Total O₂ = 0.5n\n\nNow, let's compare this with our experimental results:\n*   Total O₂ = 0.5n = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Total N₂ = 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches the experiment)\n*   Total H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol (Matches the experiment)\n\nThe hypothesis is correct. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**5. Verify the total mass.**\n\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.2 g + 4.0 g = 7.20 g (Matches the initial mass)\n\n**6. Calculate the final answer.**\n\nThe question asks for the **total number of all atoms in salts A and B** (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Absorption Data**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze what each tube tells us:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect and absorb acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   Mass increase = 0 g.\n    *   This is a crucial piece of information: no acidic gases were produced. This rules out salts containing carbonate (CO₃²⁻) or organic anions that would decompose to CO₂.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂).\n    *   The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in the tube's weight is due to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass increase = mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all these steps, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify the Gaseous Products and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nThe decomposition of the salt mixture produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol of Gas C\n\nThe original salts are heated \"without air\". The products must come from the elements within the salts. The gases H₂O and O₂ are composed of H and O. What could Gas C be? Given that it passed through all the tubes without reacting, it must be a relatively inert gas. The most common inert gas produced from heating nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\nLet's assume Gas C is N₂ and check if the law of conservation of mass holds.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = moles × molar mass = 0.10 mol × 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis total mass exactly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). This confirms that our identification of the products (H₂O, O₂, and N₂) and their quantities is correct.\n\n**3. Determine the Empirical Formula of the Mixture**\n\nNow we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Moles H = 2 × moles H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Moles N = 2 × moles N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in both H₂O and O₂. Moles O = (1 × moles H₂O) + (2 × moles O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nSo, the original mixture contained only H, N, and O atoms. The problem states the mixture consists of two salts, A and B, in an equimolar ratio. Let's say there are `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n\nThe combined formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B, let's call it (A+B), must have an elemental ratio of N:H:O corresponding to the molar ratio we found:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, we can divide by the smallest number (0.05):\nN : H : O = (0.20/0.05) : (0.40/0.05) : (0.25/0.05) = 4 : 8 : 5.\nSo, the combined empirical formula for (A+B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n**4. Identify the Individual Salts A and B**\n\nWe need to partition the formula N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salt formulas. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺). If we have two salts, we likely have two ammonium cations.\n*   Two NH₄⁺ ions have the formula N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting this from the total formula: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\n*   This N₂O₅ must be the sum of the two anions in salts A and B. The most common and simple nitrogen-oxygen anions (oxyanions) are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   Let's check if they sum to N₂O₅: NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ → N₂O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂** (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃** (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n\nLet's check the decomposition reactions. At ~200°C:\n*   NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃ (s) → 2N₂ (g) + O₂ (g) + 4H₂O (g)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's find the number of moles (`n`).\nMolar mass of (A+B) = M(N₄H₈O₅) = 4(14) + 8(1) + 5(16) = 56 + 8 + 80 = 144 g/mol.\nTotal mass of mixture = `n` × M(A+B) = 7.20 g\n`n` = 7.20 g / 144 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\nSo we have 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\nLet's see if this produces the correct amount of gas:\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio) → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.025 mol O₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   **Total products:**\n    *   N₂: 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches)\n    *   H₂O: 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol (Matches)\n    *   O₂: 0.025 mol (Matches)\nThe identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   Salt A is Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   Number of Nitrogen atoms = 2\n    *   Number of Hydrogen atoms = 4\n    *   Number of Oxygen atoms = 3\n    *   Total atoms in Salt A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   Salt B is Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n    *   Number of Nitrogen atoms = 2\n    *   Number of Hydrogen atoms = 4\n    *   Number of Oxygen atoms = 2\n    *   Total atoms in Salt B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each salt:\nTotal atoms = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Gas Processing and Identify Products**\n\n    *   The gas mixture from the decomposition is passed through three tubes. We can determine the composition of the gas mixture by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 L of gas C remains at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n2.  **Determine the Identity of Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\n    *   The total mass of the initial salt mixture was 7.20 g. By the law of conservation of mass, this must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n    *   Total mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(C)\n    *   Mass(C) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   We can now find the molar mass of gas C:\n        *   Molar Mass(C) = Mass(C) / Moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that is unreactive towards the reagents in tubes 1, 2, and 3 is diatomic nitrogen (N₂).\n\n    So, the decomposition of the 7.20 g salt mixture produced:\n    *   0.2 mol H₂O\n    *   0.025 mol O₂\n    *   0.1 mol N₂\n\n3.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\n    *   The elements in the products (H, O, N) must have come from the original salts A and B. Let's find the total moles of each element.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × Moles(H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × Moles(N₂) = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (1 × Moles(H₂O)) + (2 × Moles(O₂)) = (1 × 0.2 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   The ratio of atoms in the combined salts (A+B) is H : N : O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives H : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5.\n\n4.  **Identify Salts A and B**\n\n    *   The problem states we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. This means Moles(A) = Moles(B) = n.\n    *   The total moles of atoms (H=0.4, N=0.2, O=0.25) came from `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n    *   The combined formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B is therefore H₈N₄O₅.\n    *   We need to partition these atoms into two plausible, stable salts. Given the elements H, N, and O, ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions are very likely candidates.\n    *   Let's try to form salts using the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺), nitrate ion (NO₃⁻), and nitrite ion (NO₂⁻).\n        *   Salt A: Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**. Its formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n        *   Salt B: Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**. Its formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Let's check if the sum of their formulas matches our derived combined formula:\n        *   (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Let's verify this with the reaction stoichiometry. The decomposition of 1 mole of A and 1 mole of B should yield the same ratio of products we found.\n        *   Known decomposition of ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n        *   Known decomposition of ammonium nitrate at ~200°C can be complex, but a known pathway, especially at slightly higher temperatures, is: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O, which simplifies to NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O.\n    *   Combining the decomposition of 1 mole of each proposed salt:\n        *   (NH₄NO₃) + (NH₄NO₂) → (N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O) + (N₂ + 2H₂O)\n        *   Combined Reaction: A + B → 2N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 4H₂O\n    *   The molar ratio of products from this reaction is N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 2 : 0.5 : 4.\n    *   The molar ratio of products we found experimentally is N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 0.1 : 0.025 : 0.2.\n    *   Dividing the experimental moles by the smallest value (0.025) gives the ratio: 4 : 1 : 8.\n    *   Multiplying the theoretical reaction ratio by 2 gives: 4 : 1 : 8. The ratios match. All evidence points to salts A and B being ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\nA) 13\nB) 15\nC) 19\nD) 17\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products based on the Experimental Setup:**\n    *   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong desiccant, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂ (by forming a CaCO₃ precipitate) or SO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such gases were produced.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, meaning the copper was oxidized by an oxygen-containing gas. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n    *   **Gas C:** The remaining gas that did not react in any of the tubes has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol. This gas must be relatively inert, like nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Identify the Gases and Deduce the Composition of Salts A and B:**\n    *   The decomposition products are H₂O, an oxidizing gas containing 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms, and 0.10 mol of an inert gas C (likely N₂).\n    *   This combination of products (H₂O, N₂, and an oxidizing nitrogen oxide) is characteristic of the thermal decomposition of ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\n    *   Let's hypothesize the salts are **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**.\n    *   Their decomposition reactions are:\n        *   **NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)**\n        *   **NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)**\n\n3.  **Verify the Hypothesis with the Stoichiometry:**\n    *   The oxidizing gas is Nitrous Oxide (N₂O). It reacts with the hot copper in Tube №3:\n        *   **N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO**\n    *   From this reaction, 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of oxygen atoms to form CuO. Since we have 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms, we must have had **0.05 mol of N₂O**.\n    *   The problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let `n` be the moles of each salt.\n        *   From the decomposition of NH₄NO₃, moles of N₂O = moles of NH₄NO₃. So, **n = 0.05 mol**.\n        *   This means the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\n4.  **Check if this matches the other products:**\n    *   **Water (H₂O):**\n        *   From NH₄NO₃: 2 * n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n        *   From NH₄NO₂: 2 * n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n        *   Total H₂O = 0.10 + 0.10 = **0.20 mol**. This matches our calculation from Tube №1.\n\n    *   **Gas C (Final N₂):**\n        *   From NH₄NO₂ decomposition: n = **0.05 mol N₂**.\n        *   From the reaction of N₂O with Cu: Moles of N₂ produced = moles of N₂O reacted = **0.05 mol N₂**.\n        *   Total N₂ (Gas C) = 0.05 + 0.05 = **0.10 mol**. This matches our calculation for the remaining gas.\n\n5.  **Check the Total Initial Mass:**\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n    *   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64 g/mol = 3.2 g.\n    *   Total Mass = 4.0 g + 3.2 g = **7.20 g**. This matches the given initial mass.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The hypothesis is confirmed. Salts A and B are NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data to identify the products of the decomposition.**\n    *   An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g is heated. This produces a mixture of gases.\n    *   The gases are passed through a series of tubes.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This absorbs water. The mass increase is 3.60 g.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O is 1.008*2 + 16.00 ≈ 18.016 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a test for acidic gases like CO₂. The mass did not change, which means no acidic gas was present, or it was neutralized by an equimolar amount of a basic gas. Since the only likely basic gas from common salt decomposition is NH₃, and it would react with water to form NH₄OH, which would then react with CO₂, this scenario is complex but possible. However, the simplest explanation is that no net acidic gas was produced.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g. Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increase is due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO), meaning the mass gain is from oxygen atoms.\n        *   Molar mass of O is 16.00 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   This oxygen must have come from an oxygen-containing gas. Common gases that react with hot copper this way are O₂ or nitrogen oxides like N₂O. The reaction with N₂O is `Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂`. This reaction transfers one oxygen atom from N₂O to Cu. Therefore, 0.05 moles of N₂O would have reacted.\n    *   **Remaining gas C:** 2.24 L at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure).\n        *   1 mole of any gas at STP occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This gas C did not react with any of the previous reagents. This strongly suggests it is Nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Reconstruct the composition of the initial gas mixture.**\n    *   Based on the analysis above, the gases produced by heating the salts were:\n        *   0.20 mol of H₂O\n        *   0.05 mol of N₂O (which reacted in tube 3)\n        *   0.10 mol of N₂ (the final remaining gas)\n    *   However, if the reacting gas was N₂O, the reaction `Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂` would produce N₂. If 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted, it would produce 0.05 mol of N₂.\n    *   This means the final 0.10 mol of N₂ consists of 0.05 mol produced from N₂O and 0.05 mol that was present in the original gas mixture.\n    *   So, the initial gas mixture from the decomposition was:\n        *   0.20 mol H₂O\n        *   0.05 mol N₂O\n        *   0.05 mol N₂\n\n3.  **Identify the salts A and B.**\n    *   We need two salts that decompose upon heating to produce H₂O, N₂O, and N₂. Ammonium salts are excellent candidates.\n    *   Consider the decomposition of ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite:\n        *   Ammonium nitrate: `NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n        *   Ammonium nitrite: `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n    *   The problem states the mixture of salts A and B is equimolar. Let's assume there are `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B.\n    *   If Salt A is `NH₄NO₂` and Salt B is `NH₄NO₃`:\n        *   From `n` moles of `NH₄NO₂`, we get `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n        *   From `n` moles of `NH₄NO₃`, we get `n` moles of N₂O and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   Total products: `n` mol N₂, `n` mol N₂O, and `4n` mol H₂O.\n    *   Comparing this with our derived quantities:\n        *   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol  => `n = 0.05`\n        *   Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol => `n = 0.05`\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 0.20 mol => `4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20`.\n    *   The molar quantities match perfectly. So, the salts are ammonium nitrite (`NH₄NO₂`) and ammonium nitrate (`NH₄NO₃`).\n\n4.  **Verify the initial mass.**\n    *   Molar mass of `NH₄NO₂` = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 2(16.00) = 64.05 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of `NH₄NO₃` = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 3(16.00) = 80.05 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass = (moles of A * Molar Mass of A) + (moles of B * Molar Mass of B)\n    *   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.05 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.05 g/mol) = 3.2025 g + 4.0025 g = 7.205 g.\n    *   This is very close to the given mass of 7.20 g, confirming our identification of the salts.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total number of atoms in the formulas of the salts.**\n    *   Salt A: `NH₄NO₂`. It contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\n    *   Salt B: `NH₄NO₃`. It contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9.\n    *   The total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of atoms in their formulas: 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe calculation performed by the Python code confirms this result.\nTotal atoms = (atoms in `NH₄NO₂`) + (atoms in `NH₄NO₃`) = 8 + 9 = 17.\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nAn equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, weighs 7.20 g. When heated, this mixture decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. Let's analyze the fate of these gases.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Gaseous Products**\n    *   The gas mixture is first passed through a tube with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, a strong dehydrating agent. The mass of this tube increases by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water (H2O) absorbed.\n        *   Molar mass of H2O = 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H2O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n    *   Next, the remaining gas mixture is passed through a Ca(OH)2 solution. The mass of this tube does not change. This indicates the absence of acidic gases like CO2 or SO2.\n\n    *   Then, the gas is passed over red-hot copper. The mass of the copper tube increases by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This increase in mass is due to the oxygen (O2) reacting with the copper.\n        *   The reaction is 2Cu + O2 → 2CuO. The mass increase is the mass of O2.\n        *   Molar mass of O2 = 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O2 = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   Finally, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to the previous reagents.\n        *   At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n        *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this inert gas is most likely nitrogen (N2).\n\n2.  **Mass Conservation and Elemental Composition**\n    Let's check if the mass of the products equals the initial mass of the salts.\n    *   Mass of H2O = 3.60 g\n    *   Mass of O2 = 0.80 g\n    *   Mass of N2 = 0.1 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n    *   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n    This matches the initial mass, so our product identification is correct.\n\n    Now, let's find the total moles of each element in the original salt mixture.\n    *   Moles of Hydrogen (H) = 2 × moles of H2O = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Moles of Nitrogen (N) = 2 × moles of N2 = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen (O) = (moles of O in H2O) + (moles of O in O2) = (1 × 0.2 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n3.  **Identifying Salts A and B**\n    The problem states we have an equimolar mixture of A and B. This means the number of moles of A is equal to the number of moles of B. The total elemental composition of the mixture (from 0.4 mol H, 0.2 mol N, and 0.25 mol O) must be distributed between A and B.\n    The ratio of atoms in the combined formula (A + B) is H : N : O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20:\n    H : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5.\n    So, the combined empirical formula for one unit of A and one unit of B is H8N4O5.\n\n    We need to find two common thermally unstable salts whose formulas sum to H8N4O5. Given the products, ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids are likely candidates.\n    *   Let's consider **Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3)**. Its formula is H4N2O3.\n    *   Let's consider **Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2)**. Its formula is H4N2O2.\n\n    Let's sum these two formulas:\n    (H4N2O3) + (H4N2O2) = H(4+4)N(2+2)O(3+2) = H8N4O5.\n    This is a perfect match. So, the salts are A = NH4NO3 and B = NH4NO2.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n    *   Number of atoms in one formula unit of Salt A (NH4NO3): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Number of atoms in one formula unit of Salt B (NH4NO2): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n\n    Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental results to identify the products of decomposition.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H2O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced by the reaction.\n    *   Molar mass of H2O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H2O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases, most commonly CO2. Since its weight did not change, no CO2 was formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O2) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O2 ≈ 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O2 = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** The volume of the remaining gas is 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Gas C is what remains after passing through a water absorber, an acid gas absorber, and an oxygen absorber. Given that the original substances are salts (likely containing nitrogen), the most probable identity for this unreactive gas is nitrogen (N2).\n\n**2. Verify the composition using the law of conservation of mass.**\n\nLet's check if the total mass of the identified products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n*   Mass of H2O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O2 = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N2 = moles × molar mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g), which confirms our identification and calculation of the products are correct.\n\n**3. Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n\nThe atoms in the products must have come from the original salts A and B.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 2 (in H2O) × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O) atoms:** 1 (in H2O) × 0.20 mol + 2 (in O2) × 0.025 mol = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N) atoms:** 2 (in N2) × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol N.\n\nSo, the 7.20 g mixture contained 0.40 mol of H, 0.25 mol of O, and 0.20 mol of N. The molar ratio is H:O:N = 0.40:0.25:0.20, which simplifies to H:O:N = 8:5:4. The combined empirical formula of the mixture is N4H8O5.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nWe are looking for two salts, A and B, in an equimolar mixture, whose combined formula is N4H8O5. The elements present (N, H, O) strongly suggest ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\n*   Let's consider ammonium nitrite (NH4NO2) and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3).\n*   Formula of NH4NO2 is N2H4O2.\n*   Formula of NH4NO3 is N2H4O3.\n*   If we have one molecule of each, the combined formula is (N2H4O2) + (N2H4O3) = **N4H8O5**. This is a perfect match.\n*   Therefore, Salt A is NH4NO2 and Salt B is NH4NO3.\n\n**5. Calculate the final answer.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH4NO2):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH4NO3):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\n**1. Analysis of the experimental data:**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong desiccant and absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the formation of water (H₂O).\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   From this, we can find the moles of hydrogen atoms in the original mixture: n(H) = 2 × n(H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a test for acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since the mass did not change, no such gases were produced. This implies the original salts do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the reaction of an oxidizing gas with copper to form CuO. The mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms that reacted with Cu = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol. This oxygen could come from gases like O₂ or N₂O.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of an inert gas C remains at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given that the salts are likely nitrogen-based (a common component of salts that decompose into gases), this inert gas is most probably nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × n(N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n**2. Determining the elemental composition of the initial mixture:**\n\nLet's find the total moles and mass of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** n(H) = 0.40 mol. Mass = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** n(N) = 0.20 mol. Mass = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** The total oxygen is the sum of the oxygen in the water and the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   n(O) = n(O in H₂O) + n(O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   **Total Mass Check:** 0.40 g (H) + 2.80 g (N) + 4.00 g (O) = 7.20 g. This matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming that the salts A and B are composed only of N, H, and O.\n\n**3. Identifying Salts A and B:**\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the combined mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5.\n\nThe combined formula of (Salt A + Salt B) is N₄H₈O₅. Since the mixture is equimolar, we need to find two salts whose formulas sum to this. The most common salts containing N, H, and O are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\n\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Formula N₂H₄O₂\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Formula N₂H₄O₃\n\nLet's sum the formulas: (N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\nThus, salts A and B are **ammonium nitrite** and **ammonium nitrate**.\n\n**4. Calculating the total number of atoms:**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental data and identify the gaseous products.**\n\n*   An equimolar mixture of salts A and B (total mass = 7.20 g) is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases.\n*   The gas mixture is passed through three tubes sequentially.\n    1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H2O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H2O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H2O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H2O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO2 or SO2. The mass did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n    3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O2) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O2 → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube is equal to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Mass of O2 = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O2 = 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O2 = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper, indicating it is a relatively inert gas. Nitrogen (N2) is a common product of the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume at STP / Molar volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol. Let's assume Gas C is N2.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the products with the Law of Conservation of Mass.**\n\nLet's calculate the total mass of the gaseous products we have identified:\n*   Mass of H2O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O2 = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N2 = moles × molar mass = 0.1 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of gases = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis total mass is equal to the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). This confirms that our identification and calculation of the products (H2O, O2, N2) are correct.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the elemental composition of the salt mixture.**\n\nThe atoms in the product gases (N, H, O) must have come from the original salts A and B. Let's calculate the total moles of each element.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** from 0.2 mol of H2O → 0.2 mol × 2 = 0.4 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** from 0.1 mol of N2 → 0.1 mol × 2 = 0.2 mol N.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** from 0.2 mol of H2O and 0.025 mol of O2 → (0.2 mol × 1) + (0.025 mol × 2) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the combined mixture of A and B is N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\nN : H : O = (0.2 × 20) : (0.4 × 20) : (0.25 × 20) = 4 : 8 : 5.\nSo, the combined empirical formula for the equimolar mixture (one unit of A + one unit of B) is N4H8O5.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the individual salts A and B.**\n\nWe need to split the combined formula N4H8O5 into two plausible salt formulas.\n*   The salts contain N, H, and O. The formation of N2 and H2O upon heating suggests ammonium (NH4+) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\n*   The H8 part of the formula corresponds exactly to two ammonium ions: 2 × NH4+ = N2H8.\n*   If we take away N2H8 from N4H8O5, we are left with the atoms for the two anions: N(4-2)H(8-8)O5 = N2O5.\n*   We need to split N2O5 into two common nitrogen-containing oxyanions. The most common ones are nitrite (NO2⁻) and nitrate (NO3⁻).\n    *   NO2⁻ + NO3⁻ = N(1+1)O(2+3) = N2O5. This is a perfect match.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3).\n\n**Step 5: Verify the moles and decomposition reactions.**\n\nThe molar ratio of the products N2 : O2 : H2O was found to be 0.1 : 0.025 : 0.2, which simplifies to 4 : 1 : 8.\nLet's check if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of NH4NO2 and NH4NO3 yields this ratio.\n*   Decomposition of NH4NO2: NH4NO2 → N2 + 2H2O\n*   Decomposition of NH4NO3: 2NH4NO3 → 2N2 + O2 + 4H2O (or simplified per mole: NH4NO3 → N2 + 0.5O2 + 2H2O)\nFor an equimolar mixture (e.g., 1 mole of each):\n*   From 1 mole of NH4NO2: 1 mole N2, 2 moles H2O\n*   From 1 mole of NH4NO3: 1 mole N2, 0.5 mole O2, 2 moles H2O\n*   Total products: (1+1) moles N2, 0.5 moles O2, (2+2) moles H2O = 2 moles N2, 0.5 moles O2, 4 moles H2O.\n*   The molar ratio is N2 : O2 : H2O = 2 : 0.5 : 4, which simplifies to 4 : 1 : 8. This matches the experimental results, confirming the identities of salts A and B.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in their chemical formulas).\n*   **Salt A (NH4NO2):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 (in NH4+) + 1 (in NO2-) = 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in NH4NO2 = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH4NO3):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 (in NH4+) + 1 (in NO3-) = 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in NH4NO3 = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both salts = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data to identify the products of the decomposition.**\n    *   The initial sample is a 7.20 g equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B.\n    *   Heating this mixture produces only gases.\n    *   The gas mixture is passed through three tubes sequentially.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent.

This tells us the original salts do not contain Carbon or Sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Copper at high temperature reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is purely the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol O atoms**.\n    *   Since the salts are likely nitrogen-based (a common theme in such problems), a very common oxidizing gas produced during decomposition is dinitrogen monoxide (N₂O). The reaction is `Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂`. In this reaction, one mole of N₂O provides one mole of oxygen atoms to the copper. Therefore, the amount of N₂O that passed through this tube was **0.05 mol N₂O**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   This gas passed through a water absorber, a base, and hot copper without reacting. This strongly indicates the gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nThe decomposition produced H₂O, N₂O, and N₂. Therefore, the original salts A and B must be composed only of Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N). Let's find the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen atoms ended up in the water.\n    *   Total H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol H**.\n\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The total N₂ collected (Gas C) is the sum of N₂ produced directly in the decomposition and the N₂ produced from the reduction of N₂O in tube №3.\n    *   Total N₂ collected = 0.10 mol.\n    *   N₂ from N₂O reduction (`Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂`) = moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Therefore, N₂ produced directly from decomposition = Total N₂ - N₂ from N₂O = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol N₂**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = (2 × moles of N₂ from decomp.) + (2 × moles of N₂O) = (2 × 0.05) + (2 × 0.05) = 0.10 + 0.10 = **0.20 mol N**.\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen atoms are found in the produced H₂O and N₂O.\n    *   Total O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O in N₂O) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol O**.\n\n*   **Verify Mass:** Let's check if the masses of the elements add up to the initial mass of the mixture.\n    *   Mass H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n    *   Mass N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n    *   Mass O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n    *   Total mass = 0.40 + 2.80 + 4.00 = 7.20 g. This matches perfectly.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture. The combined empirical formula of one unit of A and one unit of B can be found from the molar ratio of the elements:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get the simplest integer ratio, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\nSo, the combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to find two common salts made of N, H, and O that add up to this formula. Let's consider common ammonium salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrite: **NH₄NO₂** (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n*   Ammonium nitrate: **NH₄NO₃** (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n\nLet's check if they fit:\n*   **Sum of Formulas:** (N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\n*   **Decomposition Reactions (at ~200°C):**\n    *   `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n    *   `NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n    These reactions produce exactly the gases we identified (N₂, N₂O, and H₂O) in the correct molar ratios.\n\nTherefore, Salt A is Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Salt B is Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Experimental Data and Identify the Products\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gases are passed through a series of tubes, and the mass changes of these tubes provide information about the composition of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2**\n    *   This substance is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase is 3.60 g, which is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were produced in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, which implies the gas provided oxygen to the copper. The reaction could be with O₂, N₂O, NO, etc.\n    *   The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Mass of oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all the reagents used (Mg(ClO₄)₂, Ca(OH)₂, hot Cu), suggesting it is likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture\n\nThe initial salts A and B decomposed completely into the gaseous products we've just quantified. By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass and elemental composition of the products must equal that of the initial reactants.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × n(H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and the species that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = n(O in H₂O) + n(O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   **Other Elements (likely Nitrogen, N):** The total initial mass was 7.20 g. We can find the mass of the remaining elements by subtraction.\n    *   Mass of other elements = Total mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O)\n    *   Mass of other elements = 7.20 g - (Mass of H₂O + Mass of O reacted with Cu) = 7.20 g - (3.60 g + 0.80 g) = 2.80 g.\n    *   Let's assume the remaining element is nitrogen, as is common in decomposing salts. The final inert gas C is also likely N₂.\n    *   If the mass is 2.80 g of Nitrogen, then:\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   If the final gas C is N₂, its number of moles would be n(N₂) = 0.20 mol N / 2 = 0.10 mol. This perfectly matches the calculated moles of gas C from its volume.\n    *   This confirms our assumption: the salts contain only Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n### 3. Determine the Formulas of Salts A and B\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. This means we have some number of moles, `x`, of salt A and `x` moles of salt B. The total elemental composition we found (0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, 0.25 mol O) corresponds to this entire mixture.\n\nThe molar ratio of elements in the combined mixture (A + B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nThis means that the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to find two plausible inorganic salts, A and B, that contain N, H, and O, and whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The most common and simple salts fitting this description are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxoacids.\nLet's consider:\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N(2+2)H(4+4)O(3+2) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n(We can also quickly verify this with the decomposition reactions. At ~200°C:\nNH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\nNH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\nIf we have `x` moles of each, we get `x` mol N₂, `x` mol N₂O, and `4x` mol H₂O.\nThe N₂O reacts with Cu: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\nThe products match the experimental results perfectly, confirming the identity of the salts.)\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (e.g., NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (e.g., NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in A and B:**\n    *   Total atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe total number of atoms is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental results to identify the gaseous products.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = mass / molar mass = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, etc. Since the weight of this tube did not change, it means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition of the salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This means an oxidizing gas passed through the tube and reacted with copper. The increase in mass is solely due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Reaction: `Gas-O + Cu → CuO + ...`\n    *   The mass increase is the mass of oxygen. Mass of O = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = mass / molar mass = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the reagents used.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n**2. Formulate a hypothesis about the identity of salts A and B.**\n\n*   The initial substance is a mixture of two salts, A and B, that decompose upon heating to form *only* a mixture of gases. This is a very strong clue. This behavior is characteristic of certain ammonium salts of volatile acids, particularly those containing oxygen and nitrogen.\n*   The products include water (H₂O), an oxygen-providing gas, and an inert gas. This strongly suggests the salts are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n*   Let's assume this hypothesis is correct and test it against the experimental data.\n    *   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)**\n    *   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)** (at ~200°C)\n\n**3. Test the hypothesis using the quantitative data.**\n\n*   The gas mixture produced would consist of N₂, N₂O, and H₂O.\n    *   N₂ is inert. It would be the final gas C (or part of it).\n    *   N₂O is an oxidizing gas. It would react with hot copper: **N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂**.\n    *   H₂O is absorbed by Mg(ClO₄)₂.\n    *   No acidic gases are produced, which is consistent with the observation for tube №2.\n\n*   Let `n` be the number of moles for each salt, since the initial mixture is equimolar.\n    *   From the decomposition reactions:\n        *   Moles of N₂ produced = `n` (from NH₄NO₂)\n        *   Moles of N₂O produced = `n` (from NH₄NO₃)\n        *   Total moles of H₂O produced = `2n` (from NH₄NO₂) + `2n` (from NH₄NO₃) = `4n`.\n\n*   Now, let's use the experimental mole quantities:\n    *   We found that 0.2 mol of H₂O was produced. So, `4n = 0.2 mol`, which gives **`n = 0.05 mol`**.\n    *   This means the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of salt A (NH₄NO₂) and 0.05 mol of salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   Let's check the other products:\n    *   Moles of N₂O produced = `n` = 0.05 mol. When this reacts with copper (`N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂`), it provides 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Mass of oxygen = 0.05 mol * 16 g/mol = 0.80 g. This perfectly matches the mass increase of tube №3.\n    *   The gas remaining (gas C) would be all the nitrogen. This includes the initial N₂ from the decomposition of NH₄NO₂ and the N₂ produced from the reaction of N₂O with copper.\n    *   Total moles of N₂ = (moles N₂ from NH₄NO₂) + (moles N₂ from N₂O reaction) = `n` + `n` = 0.05 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   The volume of this gas at STP is 0.1 mol * 22.4 L/mol = 2.24 L. This perfectly matches the volume of gas C.\n\n**4. Verify the initial mass.**\n\n*   Molar mass of A (NH₄NO₂) = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of B (NH₄NO₃) = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (moles of A × molar mass of A) + (moles of B × molar mass of B)\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n*   This matches the given initial weight of the mixture. The hypothesis is fully confirmed.\n\n**5. Determine the total number of atoms.**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** The formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** The formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental data to identify the products and their quantities.**\n\n*   The mixture of salts A and B is heated, and only gases are formed. These gases are passed through a series of tubes.\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of this tube is equal to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, etc. The mass of this tube did not change.\n    *   This indicates that no acidic gases were produced in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in the mass of the tube is due to the mass of the oxygen atoms that have reacted.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since the gas is molecular oxygen (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining gas C:** After removing H₂O and O₂, 2.24 L of gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n*   **Identify gas C:** We can use the law of conservation of mass. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the reactants (7.20 g).\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol × 32.0 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of gas C = Total mass - Mass of H₂O - Mass of O₂\n    *   Mass of gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now, we can find the molar mass of gas C.\n    *   Molar Mass of C = Mass of C / Moles of C = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n    *   A gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is inert to the reagents used is nitrogen (N₂). So, gas C is N₂.\n\n**2. Determine the chemical formulas of salts A and B.**\n\n*   The products of the decomposition are N₂, O₂, and H₂O. This means the original salts must contain the elements Nitrogen (N), Oxygen (O), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   Since they are salts and decompose completely into gases, they are likely ammonium salts of oxygen-containing anions. The most common and plausible candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n*   Let's test this hypothesis. Let salt A be NH₄NO₃ and salt B be NH₄NO₂.\n*   The decomposition reactions are:\n    *   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O (This is a high-temperature decomposition, which fits the products)\n*   The problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let's say there were `x` moles of salt A and `x` moles of salt B.\n*   Let's calculate the total moles of each product based on `x` moles of each salt:\n    *   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₂(B): `x` mol of N₂ and `2x` mol of H₂O.\n    *   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₃(A): `x` mol of N₂ (from 2N₂/2NH₄NO₃), `0.5x` mol of O₂ (from O₂/2NH₄NO₃), and `2x` mol of H₂O (from 4H₂O/2NH₄NO₃).\n*   Total moles of products:\n    *   Total N₂ = `x` (from B) + `x` (from A) = `2x`\n    *   Total O₂ = `0.5x` (from A)\n    *   Total H₂O = `2x` (from B) + `2x` (from A) = `4x`\n*   Now, we equate these with the experimental values we found:\n    *   Total N₂ = 0.1 mol  => `2x = 0.1` => `x = 0.05`\n    *   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol => `0.5x = 0.025` => `x = 0.05`\n    *   Total H₂O = 0.2 mol  => `4x = 0.2` => `x = 0.05`\n*   All three calculations give a consistent value of `x = 0.05` mol. This strongly supports our hypothesis.\n\n**3. Verify the total mass.**\n\n*   The mixture contains 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 4.0 g + 3.2 g = 7.20 g.\n*   This matches the initial mass given in the problem. Our identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**4. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of each tube and identify the products.**\n    *   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong desiccant (drying agent). Its purpose is to absorb water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to test for acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no CO₂ was produced.\n    *   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O₂). The reaction is `2Cu(s) + O₂(g) -> 2CuO(s)`. The increase in the mass of the tube is due to the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Mass of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of oxygen gas produced are half the moles of oxygen atoms: Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains. This measurement is at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n        *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, limewater, or hot copper. The products contain H, O, and N (from the salts). The most likely candidate for this inert gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Summarize the decomposition products.**\n    The decomposition of salts A and B produces:\n    *   0.2 mol of H₂O\n    *   0.025 mol of O₂\n    *   0.1 mol of N₂\n\n3.  **Deduce the composition of salts A and B.**\n    *   The products (H₂O, N₂, O₂) show that the original salts must contain the elements Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O).\n    *   The fact that they are salts and decompose completely into gases strongly suggests they are ammonium salts containing an oxygen-and-nitrogen-based anion.\n    *   Let's hypothesize the salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n4.  **Write the balanced decomposition equations and check stoichiometry.**\n    Let's assume the mixture contains `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B (equimolar mixture).\n\n    *   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite):** `NH₄NO₂(s) -> N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n        *   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂, we get `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate):** The decomposition of ammonium nitrate can produce different products depending on the temperature. A common reaction that produces O₂ is: `2NH₄NO₃(s) -> 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)`. Let's use this stoichiometry.\n        *   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃, we get `n` moles of N₂, `n/2` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\n5.  **Relate the stoichiometry to the experimental results to find 'n'.**\n    *   **Total Moles of H₂O:** `2n` (from A) + `2n` (from B) = `4n`.\n        *   `4n = 0.2` mol => `n = 0.05` mol.\n    *   **Total Moles of O₂:** `0` (from A) + `n/2` (from B) = `n/2`.\n        *   `n/2 = 0.025` mol => `n = 0.05` mol.\n    *   **Total Moles of N₂:** `n` (from A) + `n` (from B) = `2n`.\n        *   `2n = 0.1` mol => `n = 0.05` mol.\n\n    All calculations consistently give `n = 0.05` mol. This confirms our identification of the salts and their decomposition reactions is correct.\n\n6.  **Verify the initial mass.**\n    *   Molar mass of A (NH₄NO₂): (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 1.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 64.06 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of B (NH₄NO₃): (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 1.01) + (3 × 16.00) = 80.06 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass of the mixture = `n * M_A + n * M_B`\n    *   Total mass = `0.05 mol * (64.06 g/mol + 80.06 g/mol)`\n    *   Total mass = `0.05 * 144.12` = 7.206 g.\n    This is in excellent agreement with the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n7.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms =** 8 (from A) + 9 (from B) = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the mass changes in the tubes to identify the gaseous products.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced by the decomposition.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂ (by forming a precipitate, CaCO₃). Since the mass of the tube did not change, no CO₂ or other acidic gases were formed. This indicates the salts do not contain carbonate ions or organic anions that would decompose into CO₂.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O₂), but also others like nitrogen oxides (e.g., N₂O). The reaction with oxygen is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, limewater, or hot copper. The most plausible identity for such an inert gas in the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\n\nThe elements in the products (H₂O, O-atoms, N₂) must have originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen ends up as the final gas C, which we identified as N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water produced and in the copper oxide formed.\n    *   Moles of O = (Moles of O in H₂O) + (Moles of O reacted with Cu)\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × 0.20 mol) + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   **Verify Total Mass:**\n    *   Total mass = Mass(H) + Mass(N) + Mass(O) = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming that the salts A and B are composed only of hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. They are salts, implying an ionic structure, likely consisting of the ammonium cation (NH₄⁺) and an oxygen-containing anion of nitrogen (oxyanion). The most common such salts are:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles of salt A and 'n' be the number of moles of salt B. We can use the total moles of each element to find 'n'.\n\nLet's assume A = NH₄NO₂ and B = NH₄NO₃.\n*   Formula of A: N₂H₄O₂\n*   Formula of B: N₂H₄O₃\n\nNow, let's write the balance for total moles of each element in the mixture:\n*   **Total H:** n(moles of H in A) + n(moles of H in B) = n(4) + n(4) = 8n.\n    *   We found total moles of H = 0.40 mol. So, 8n = 0.40 ⇒ n = 0.05 mol.\n*   **Total N:** n(moles of N in A) + n(moles of N in B) = n(2) + n(2) = 4n.\n    *   We found total moles of N = 0.20 mol. So, 4n = 0.20 ⇒ n = 0.05 mol.\n*   **Total O:** n(moles of O in A) + n(moles of O in B) = n(2) + n(3) = 5n.\n    *   We found total moles of O = 0.25 mol. So, 5n = 0.25 ⇒ n = 0.05 mol.\n\nThe value n = 0.05 mol is consistent for all three elements. This confirms that the salts are indeed ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n**4. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms:**\n    *   Total = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe total number of atoms is 17. This corresponds to option B.\n\nTo be thorough, let's check if the decomposition reactions match the products.\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   0.05 mol → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O\n*   There are two main decomposition paths for NH₄NO₃. Both are consistent with our findings.\n    *   Path 1: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n        *   0.05 mol → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.025 mol O₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O\n    *   Path 2: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g), where N₂O then reacts with Cu: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\n        *   0.05 mol → 0.05 mol N₂O + 0.10 mol H₂O\n\nTotal products (using Path 1):\n*   Total N₂ = 0.05 (from A) + 0.05 (from B) = 0.10 mol (matches Gas C).\n*   Total H₂O = 0.10 (from A) + 0.10 (from B) = 0.20 mol (matches Tube 1).\n*   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol (from B). This contains 0.05 mol of O atoms (matches Tube 3).\n\nThe analysis is fully consistent.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nAn equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, weighs 7.20 g. Upon heating to 200°C, it decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. The products are analyzed sequentially.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the products:**\n    *   The gas mixture is passed through a tube with anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂, a powerful drying agent. The mass of this tube increases by 3.60 g. This mass gain is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n        *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 1.01*2 + 16.00 = 18.02 g/mol\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol\n\n    *   Next, the gas passes through a Ca(OH)₂ solution. The mass of this tube does not change. This indicates that no acidic gas, such as CO₂, was produced. Therefore, the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n    *   Then, the gas is passed over red-hot copper (Cu). The mass of this tube increases by 0.80 g. Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen gas.\n        *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ = 16.00 * 2 = 32.00 g/mol\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol\n\n    *   Finally, 2.24 L of a remaining gas C is collected at standard temperature and pressure (STP). At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol\n        *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. Given that the products contain H, O, and must contain another element from the salts, the most likely candidate for this inert gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Summary of Products and Mass Conservation:**\n    *   Products are: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n    *   Let's check the total mass of the products:\n        *   Mass H₂O = 0.20 mol * 18.02 g/mol = 3.60 g\n        *   Mass O₂ = 0.025 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g\n        *   Mass N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n        *   Total mass = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g\n    *   This matches the initial mass of the salt mixture, confirming our identification of the products and their quantities.\n\n3.  **Identification of Salts A and B:**\n    *   The products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) indicate that the original salts must contain the elements H, O, and N.\n    *   Since they are salts, they are composed of a cation and an anion. A common cation containing H and N is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). Common anions containing N and O are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n    *   Let's hypothesize that the salts are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n4.  **Stoichiometry of Decomposition:**\n    *   The decomposition of ammonium nitrite is: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   The decomposition of ammonium nitrate must produce N₂, O₂, and H₂O. The balanced equation that fits the products is: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n5.  **Solving for the Moles of Each Salt:**\n    *   The problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let `x` be the moles of NH₄NO₃ and `x` be the moles of NH₄NO₂.\n    *   From the decomposition reactions:\n        *   Total moles of O₂ produced = `x/2` (only from NH₄NO₃)\n        *   Total moles of N₂ produced = `x` (from NH₄NO₂) + `x` (from NH₄NO₃) = `2x`\n        *   Total moles of H₂O produced = `2x` (from NH₄NO₂) + `2x` (from NH₄NO₃) = `4x`\n    *   Using the experimental moles of O₂:\n        *   moles of O₂ = `x/2` = 0.025 mol\n        *   Solving for `x`: x = 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n    *   Let's verify this with the other products:\n        *   Predicted moles of N₂ = 2x = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (Matches)\n        *   Predicted moles of H₂O = 4x = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (Matches)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n    *   Salt A: NH₄NO₃\n        *   Atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 3 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms\n    *   Salt B: NH₄NO₂\n        *   Atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 2 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = 8 atoms\n    *   Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17\n\nThe total number of atoms in the two salt formulas is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data to identify the products of the decomposition.**\n    *   An initial equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, weighing 7.20 g, is heated.

The gas produced is not H₂O, not O₂, and not an acidic gas. The most plausible identity for Gas C, formed from heating nitrogen-containing salts, is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n2.  **Determine the elemental composition of the original salts.**\n    *   The products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. By the law of conservation of mass, the original salts must be composed of Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N).\n    *   Let's check if the total mass of the elements in the products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g).\n        *   Mass of H = 0.20 mol H₂O * (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) * 1.0 g/mol H = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass of O = (0.20 mol H₂O * 16.0 g/mol O) + (0.025 mol O₂ * 32.0 g/mol O₂) - Mass O in O₂ = (0.20 mol * 16.0 g/mol) + 0.80 g = 3.20 g + 0.80 g = 4.00 g.\n        *   Mass of N = 0.10 mol N₂ * 28.0 g/mol N₂ = 2.80 g.\n        *   Total Mass = 0.40 g (H) + 4.00 g (O) + 2.80 g (N) = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass perfectly, confirming our identification of the products.\n\n3.  **Identify salts A and B.**\n    *   We need to find two salts made of N, H, and O.\n    *   The most common cation formed from H and N is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺).\n    *   Common anions formed from N and O are the nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻) ions.\n    *   Therefore, the most likely candidates for salts A and B are **ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).**\n\n4.  **Use stoichiometry to confirm the identities and quantities.**\n    *   Let `n` be the number of moles for both salt A and salt B (since they are in an equimolar mixture).\n    *   Consider the known thermal decomposition reactions:\n        *   **NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)**\n        *   **2NH₄NO₃ (s) → 2N₂ (g) + O₂ (g) + 4H₂O (g)** (This reaction occurs under specific conditions but fits our products).\n    *   Let's write equations for the total moles of each product based on `n` moles of each salt:\n        *   Total moles N₂ = n (from NH₄NO₂) + n (from NH₄NO₃) = 2n\n        *   Total moles H₂O = 2n (from NH₄NO₂) + 2n (from NH₄NO₃) = 4n\n        *   Total moles O₂ = 0 (from NH₄NO₂) + 0.5n (from NH₄NO₃) = 0.5n\n    *   Now, we use our experimental mole data to solve for `n`:\n        *   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**.\n    *   Let's verify this value of `n` with the other products:\n        *   N₂: 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol.

Analyze the Experimental Data and Identify the Products**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gas mixture is passed through a series of traps to identify its components.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water. The mass of this tube increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water (`H₂O`) produced during the decomposition.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a lime water test, used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (`CO₂`), which would form a precipitate (`CaCO₃`). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no `CO₂` or other acidic gas was present in the mixture. This tells us the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g. The reaction involves the copper being oxidized to copper(II) oxide (`CuO`). The mass increase is solely due to the mass of oxygen atoms that have reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas (C) remains under standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Formulate a Hypothesis about the Salts' Identities**\n\nThe decomposition produces `H₂O`, an oxygen-donating gas, and another inert gas, but no `CO₂`. The presence of H, O, and N (as a likely component of the inert gas) points towards ammonium salts of nitrogen oxoacids. Two common examples that fit this profile are ammonium nitrite (`NH₄NO₂`) and ammonium nitrate (`NH₄NO₃`).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that salts A and B are `NH₄NO₂` and `NH₄NO₃`. Their decomposition reactions upon heating are:\n*   `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n*   `NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n\nSo, the initial gas mixture would contain `N₂`, `N₂O`, and `H₂O`.\n\n**3. Verify the Hypothesis Quantitatively**\n\nThe problem states that the initial mixture was equimolar. Let `n` be the number of moles of salt A (`NH₄NO₂`) and also `n` for salt B (`NH₄NO₃`).\n\n*   **Water (H₂O):** From the reactions, `NH₄NO₂` produces `2n` moles of H₂O, and `NH₄NO₃` also produces `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H₂O = `2n + 2n = 4n`.\n    *   From our analysis in step 1, we know 0.20 mol of H₂O was produced.\n    *   Therefore, `4n = 0.20` mol, which means `n = 0.05` mol.\n\n*   **Oxygen for Tube №3:** Let's see which gas reacts with the hot copper. `N₂` is very stable and would not react. `N₂O` (nitrous oxide) will decompose on hot copper in the reaction: `N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO`.\n    *   From the decomposition of `n` moles of `NH₄NO₃`, `n` moles of `N₂O` are produced.\n    *   Each mole of `N₂O` contains one mole of oxygen atoms. Thus, `n` moles of `N₂O` provide `n` moles of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n    *   From step 1, we know 0.05 mol of O atoms reacted.\n    *   Therefore, `n = 0.05` mol. This result is consistent with the value of `n` we calculated from the amount of water.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** Gas C is what's left after Tube 3. The gases entering Tube 3 are `N₂` and `N₂O`.\n    *   `N₂` from `NH₄NO₂` decomposition: `n` moles.\n    *   `N₂O` from `NH₄NO₃` decomposition: `n` moles. This reacts completely to form `N₂` gas: `N₂O → N₂ + [O]`.\n    *   So, the total moles of `N₂` (Gas C) exiting Tube 3 is the initial `n` moles plus the `n` moles from the `N₂O` reaction.\n    *   Total moles of Gas C = `n + n = 2n`.\n    *   Using `n = 0.05` mol, the moles of Gas C = `2 * 0.05 = 0.10` mol.\n    *   This perfectly matches the 0.10 mol of Gas C we calculated from the volume in step 1.\n\n**4. Check the Initial Mass**\n\nThe hypothesis holds true for all products. Let's check if the initial mass is also correct.\n\n*   Salt A: `NH₄NO₂` (Molar Mass ≈ 14+4+14+32 = 64 g/mol)\n*   Salt B: `NH₄NO₃` (Molar Mass ≈ 14+4+14+48 = 80 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = (moles of A × Molar Mass of A) + (moles of B × Molar Mass of B)\n*   Total mass = `(0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol)`\n*   Total mass = `3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g`.\nThis matches the given initial weight. Our identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in their chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   2 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   3 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both salts = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe problem states that a 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B is heated, producing only a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze the effect on each tube:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The mass did not change, which means no such acidic gases were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, and the tube's weight increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is due to oxygen atoms binding with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) = 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) trapped by Cu = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The source of this oxygen could be O₂ gas (reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO) or an oxygen-containing gas like nitrous oxide, N₂O (reaction: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂). Both scenarios involve 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms being transferred.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since this gas passed through all tubes unreacted, it must be inert. Nitrogen gas (N₂) is a very likely candidate.\n\n**2. Determine the Identity of the Salts**\n\nLet's work backward from the products to identify the original salts.\nThe decomposition produced H, N, and O atoms. This means salts A and B must be compounds containing these elements. The fact that they decompose completely into gases suggests they might be ammonium salts.\n\nLet's consider two plausible chemical scenarios for the decomposition. Both lead to the same answer.\n\n**Scenario A (Decomposition to N₂, O₂, H₂O):**\nThis scenario assumes the gas reacting with Cu is O₂.\n*   Moles of O atoms = 0.05 mol, so moles of O₂ molecules = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n*   The gas mixture produced was: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂ (Gas C).\n*   The molar ratio of products is N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 0.10 : 0.025 : 0.20. Dividing by 0.025 gives a simple integer ratio of **4 : 1 : 8**.\n\n**Scenario B (Decomposition to N₂, N₂O, H₂O - Chemically more likely at 200°C):**\nThis scenario assumes the gas reacting with Cu is N₂O.\n*   The reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n*   To trap 0.05 mol of O atoms, 0.05 mol of N₂O must have reacted.\n*   This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   The final Gas C (0.10 mol N₂) is the sum of the N₂ from this reaction (0.05 mol) and any N₂ that was initially produced and passed through Tube 3 unreacted.\n*   Initial N₂ = 0.10 mol (total) - 0.05 mol (from N₂O) = 0.05 mol.\n*   So, the original gas mixture was: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂, and 0.05 mol N₂O.\n\n**3. Test the Hypothesized Salts**\nLet's test if an equimolar mixture of **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) ** and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** fits our data.\n\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate (at ~200°C): NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nLet the equimolar amount of each salt in the initial mixture be 'n' moles.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: n moles of N₂O and 2n moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = n moles\n*   Total N₂O = n moles\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n moles\n\nNow, we match this with the products derived in Scenario B:\n*   Total N₂ = n = 0.05 mol\n*   Total N₂O = n = 0.05 mol\n*   Total H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol\n\nThe results match perfectly. Thus, the mixture consists of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Verify the Total Mass**\n\nLet's check if the mass of this mixture is 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThe mass matches the value given in the problem. The identification of salts A and B as NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃ is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   2 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   3 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms\n\nTotal number of atoms in salts A and B = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n**1. Identify the products and their quantities:**\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** Absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** Absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂). The weight did not change, so no acidic gases were produced.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Reacts with oxygen (O₂) via 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The weight increase of 0.80 g is the mass of O₂.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas volume is 2.24 L at STP. This gas did not react with the previous reagents.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   The total mass of the products is 3.60 g (H₂O) + 0.80 g (O₂) + (0.10 mol * 28.0 g/mol N₂) = 3.60 + 0.80 + 2.80 = 7.20 g. This equals the initial mass of the salt mixture, confirming that Gas C is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Identify the salts A and B:**\nThe decomposition produces H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This points to ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\nLet's consider the decomposition of two such salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂): NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃): 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nLet the mixture contain *n* moles of salt A (NH₄NO₂) and *n* moles of salt B (NH₄NO₃) since it is an equimolar mixture.\n\n**3. Set up stoichiometric equations:**\n*   From *n* mol of NH₄NO₂, we get: *n* mol N₂ and 2*n* mol H₂O.\n*   From *n* mol of NH₄NO₃, we get: *n* mol N₂ (from 0.5*n* of the 2-mol reaction), 0.5*n* mol O₂, and 2*n* mol H₂O.\n\n**Total moles of products:**\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 2*n + 2*n = 4*n\n*   Total moles of O₂ = 0 + 0.5*n = 0.5*n\n*   Total moles of N₂ = n + n = 2*n\n\n**4. Solve for *n*:**\nWe can use any of the product quantities to find *n*. Using oxygen is the most direct:\n*   Total moles of O₂ = 0.5*n = 0.025 mol\n*   *n* = 0.025 / 0.5 = 0.05 mol\n\nLet's verify this value of *n* with the other products:\n*   Total moles of N₂ = 2*n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches the experimental value)\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 4*n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol (Matches the experimental value)\n\nThe identities of the salts are confirmed as **NH₄NO₂** (Salt A) and **NH₄NO₃** (Salt B).\n\n**5. Calculate the total number of atoms:**\nThe question asks for the sum of the number of atoms in the chemical formulas of Salt A and Salt B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Gas Separation Process:**\n    *   The mixture of gases is passed through three tubes to identify its components.\n    *   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, there were no acidic gases in the mixture. This implies the original salts A and B do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n    *   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in the tube's weight is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that have combined with the copper.\n        *   Mass increase = Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ gas, the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation:**\n    *   The total initial mass of salts was 7.20 g. This must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n    *   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O₂ produced = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.025 mol × 32 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now, we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n        *   Molar Mass of C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n    *   A gas that is inert to the reagents used and has a molar mass of 28 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂). So, Gas C is N₂.\n\n3.  **Determine the Identity of Salts A and B:**\n    *   The decomposition products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This means the original salts must contain only the elements Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n    *   Salts that decompose upon heating to produce only these gases are typically ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. The most common examples are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃.\n    *   **Decomposition reactions:**\n        *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n    *   The problem states we have an **equimolar mixture**.

The initial mixture is equimolar, so let the number of moles of each salt be 'n'.\n    *   **From n mol of NH₄NO₂:** we get n mol of N₂ and 2n mol of H₂O.\n    *   **From n mol of NH₄NO₃:** we get n mol of N₂, 0.5n mol of O₂, and 2n mol of H₂O.\n    *   **Total moles of products:**\n        *   Total N₂ = n + n = **2n**\n        *   Total O₂ = 0 + 0.5n = **0.5n**\n        *   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = **4n**\n    *   Now we use our calculated moles of products to find 'n':\n        *   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**\n        *   From N₂ (Gas C): 2n = 0.10 mol => **n = 0.05 mol**\n        *   From H₂O: 4n ≈ 0.20 mol  => **n ≈ 0.05 mol**\n    *   All calculations yield a consistent value of n = 0.05 mol, confirming our identification of the salts.\n\n5.  **Verify the Initial Mass:**\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01 + 4(1.008) + 14.01 + 2(16.00) ≈ 64.05 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01 + 4(1.008) + 14.01 + 3(16.00) ≈ 80.05 g/mol\n    *   Total mass = (mass of NH₄NO₂) + (mass of NH₄NO₃)\n    *   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.05 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.05 g/mol)\n    *   Total mass = 3.2025 g + 4.0025 g = **7.205 g**\n    *   This is in excellent agreement with the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B combined.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated, producing a mixture of gases. This gas mixture was passed through several tubes, allowing us to identify the components and their quantities.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Gaseous Products:**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a dehydrating agent. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n        *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no significant amount of acidic gases were produced.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Molar Mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After the absorption of water and oxygen, 2.24 L of a gas remains at STP. This corresponds to:\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   The products are H₂O, O₂, and an inert gas (C). This points to the original salts being composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). Therefore, Gas C is most likely Nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Identifying the Salts A and B:**\n    *   The decomposition products are N₂, O₂, and H₂O. The original salts must contain N, H, and O. Common salts with these elements are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). Let's test this hypothesis.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃.\n    *   The decomposition reactions at around 200°C are:\n        *   A: `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n        *   B: `2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)` or for one mole: `NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂(g) + 0.5O₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n    *   The problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles for both salt A and salt B.\n    *   From the decomposition of `n` moles of each salt, the total moles of products are:\n        *   Total Moles of O₂ = `n * 0.5` (only from salt B)\n        *   Total Moles of N₂ = `n * 1` (from A) + `n * 1` (from B) = `2n`\n        *   Total Moles of H₂O = `n * 2` (from A) + `n * 2` (from B) = `4n`\n\n3.  **Verifying the Hypothesis:**\n    *   We can find 'n' using the moles of oxygen calculated earlier:\n        *   0.025 mol O₂ = 0.5n  =>  n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of salt A and 0.05 mol of salt B.\n    *   Let's check if this value of 'n' gives the correct amounts of the other products:\n        *   Predicted Moles of N₂ = 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches experiment).\n        *   Predicted Moles of H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol (Matches experiment).\n    *   Finally, let's check the initial total mass:\n        *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.0 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol * 64.0 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n        *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.0 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol * 80.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   Total Mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g (Matches the given initial mass).\n    *   The hypothesis is correct: Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n    *   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total Atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a chemical decomposition and subsequent reactions of the resulting gases.\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong desiccant (drying agent). The weight increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O formed = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which turns cloudy in the presence of acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The fact that its weight did not change means **no acidic gases were produced** in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms that reacted = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen must have come from an oxidizing gas. Given that the salts contain nitrogen, a likely candidate is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction would be N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This would mean 0.05 mol of N₂O was in the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas, C, has a volume of 2.24 L at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all the previous reagents. The most plausible gas from the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Products of Decomposition**\n\nBased on the analysis, the gaseous products of the decomposition were:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂O (which was consumed in tube №3)\n*   An amount of N₂ that, combined with the N₂ from the N₂O reaction, totals 0.10 mol.\n\nThe reaction in tube №3 (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO) shows that 0.05 mol of N₂O produces 0.05 mol of N₂. Since the total final N₂ is 0.10 mol, another 0.05 mol of N₂ must have been produced directly during the initial heating.\nSo, the initial gaseous products were:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states we started with an equimolar mixture (e.g., `x` moles of A and `x` moles of B). We need to find two salts whose decomposition in a 1:1 molar ratio produces the gases calculated above.\n\nConsider the decomposition of common ammonium salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O (when heated to ~200-250°C)\n\nLet's assume A is NH₄NO₃ and B is NH₄NO₂. If we had 0.05 mol of each:\n*   0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ → 0.05 mol N₂O + (0.05 * 2) mol H₂O = 0.05 mol N₂O + 0.10 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ → 0.05 mol N₂ + (0.05 * 2) mol H₂O = 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O\n\nTotal products:\n*   N₂O: 0.05 mol\n*   N₂: 0.05 mol\n*   H₂O: 0.10 mol + 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol\n\nThese product amounts perfectly match what we deduced from the experimental data.\n\n**4. Verify the Total Mass**\nLet's check if the mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ equals the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14+4(1)+14+3(16) = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14+4(1)+14+2(16) = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 80.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64.0 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 4.0 g + 3.2 g = 7.20 g.\nThis confirms the identities and amounts of salts A and B.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total atoms in both salts = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process that led to the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products from the Decomposition**\n    The problem describes passing a mixture of gases through a series of tubes, which separate the components based on their chemical properties.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent (desiccant), so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 1.01 * 2 + 16.00 = 18.02 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since the weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This rules out salts containing carbonate or sulfite anions.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ = 16.00 * 2 = 32.00 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** A gas that doesn't react with a strong desiccant, a base, or hot copper is very likely nitrogen (N₂).\n        *   Volume of Gas C = 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   The molar volume of a gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n        *   Moles of N₂ = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n2.  **Verify Mass Conservation**\n    Let's check if the total mass of the gaseous products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n    *   Mass of N₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × (14.01 * 2 g/mol) = 2.80 g\n    *   Total Mass of Products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n    This exactly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g), confirming that H₂O, O₂, and N₂ are the only products.\n\n3.  **Deduce the Identity of the Salts**\n    *   The products contain Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n    *   The decomposition produced only gases, which suggests the salts are composed of non-metallic ions. The most common cation in this category is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺).\n    *   The anions must contain nitrogen and oxygen. The two most common are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are likely **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) (Salt A)** and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) (Salt B)**.\n\n4.  **Write and Balance the Decomposition Reactions**\n    Let's write the thermal decomposition reactions for these two salts that would produce the observed products.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** The decomposition can proceed in multiple ways. The reaction that produces N₂, O₂, and H₂O is: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n5.  **Use Stoichiometry and the \"Equimolar\" Condition**\n    The problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles of Salt A and also the number of moles of Salt B.\n\n    Let's calculate the total moles of each product based on the reactions and the initial 'n' moles of each salt:\n    *   **Total Moles of N₂:** n (from A) + (2/2)n (from B) = n + n = **2n**\n    *   **Total Moles of O₂:** 0 (from A) + (1/2)n (from B) = **0.5n**\n    *   **Total Moles of H₂O:** 2n (from A) + (4/2)n (from B) = 2n + 2n = **4n**\n\n    Now we can use the experimental moles calculated in Step 1 to solve for 'n':\n    *   From O₂: 0.025 mol = 0.5n  => n = 0.05 mol\n    *   From N₂: 0.10 mol = 2n      => n = 0.05 mol\n    *   From H₂O: 0.20 mol = 4n      => n = 0.05 mol\n    All calculations consistently give **n = 0.05 mol**. This confirms our identification of the salts and the reactions is correct.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms in the Formulas**\n    The question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of Salt A and Salt B combined.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** It contains 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** It contains 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Total Atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n7.  **Final Answer**\n    The total number of atoms is 17, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental data to identify the decomposition products and their quantities.**\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The mass did not change, which means **no CO₂ was produced**. This tells us that the original salts do not contain carbonate (CO₃²⁻) or oxalate (C₂O₄²⁻) ions.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases like oxygen (O₂) and nitrous oxide (N₂O). The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms transferred to Cu = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The possible reactions are: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO and Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n    *   The 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms could come from O₂ gas, N₂O gas, or a mixture of both.\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Gas C passed through a drying agent, a base, and hot copper, indicating it's an inert gas. Given that the original salts are heated, a common inert product is nitrogen gas (N₂). Let's assume Gas C is N₂.\n    *   The N₂ that exits tube №3 is the sum of any N₂ produced directly from decomposition and any N₂ produced by the reduction of N₂O in tube №3.\n    *   Total moles of N₂ = n(N₂, initial) + n(N₂O, initial) = 0.10 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n\nThe decomposition was done without air, so all elements in the products (H, O, N) must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H) atoms:** From the 0.20 mol of H₂O, we have 2 * 0.20 = **0.40 mol of H atoms**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O) atoms:** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and was transferred to the copper in tube №3.\n    *   Moles of O from H₂O = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Moles of O from tube №3 = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol of O atoms**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N) atoms:** All nitrogen from the original salts ends up as N₂ gas (Gas C).\n    *   From the relationship n(N₂, total) = n(N₂, initial) + n(N₂O, initial) = 0.10 mol.\n    *   The total number of N atoms is 2 * n(N₂, initial) + 2 * n(N₂O, initial) = 2 * [n(N₂, initial) + n(N₂O, initial)] = 2 * 0.10 = **0.20 mol of N atoms**.\n\n**Step 3: Check for mass conservation.**\nLet's calculate the total mass of these elements to see if it matches the initial mass.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol * 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol * 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol * 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total mass = 0.40 + 4.00 + 2.80 = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our calculations of the elemental composition are correct.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the salts A and B.**\n\nThe salts contain only H, N, and O. They are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions, as these are known to decompose upon heating to produce water and nitrogen-containing gases. The most common candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's assume:\n*   Salt A = NH₄NO₂ (Molar mass = 14+4+14+32 = 64 g/mol)\n*   Salt B = NH₄NO₃ (Molar mass = 14+4+14+48 = 80 g/mol)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles of salt A, and 'n' be the number of moles of salt B.\n\nLet's find the total moles of each element in the mixture in terms of 'n':\n*   Total moles of H = (4 from A) * n + (4 from B) * n = 8n\n*   Total moles of N = (2 from A) * n + (2 from B) * n = 4n\n*   Total moles of O = (2 from A) * n + (3 from B) * n = 5n\n\nNow, we equate these expressions with the moles of elements we calculated in Step 2:\n*   For H: 8n = 0.40 mol  => n = 0.05 mol\n*   For N: 4n = 0.20 mol  => n = 0.05 mol\n*   For O: 5n = 0.25 mol  => n = 0.05 mol\n\nAll three calculations yield the same value for n (n = 0.05 mol), which strongly confirms that our identification of salts A and B is correct.\n\nLet's verify this with the total mass:\n*   Total mass = n * M_A + n * M_B = 0.05 mol * 64 g/mol + 0.05 mol * 80 g/mol\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the given initial mass perfectly.\n\n**Step 5: Answer the question.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

We can determine the composition and amount of the gas mixture from the mass changes of these tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is equal to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (filled with Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no gas was absorbed. This means no CO₂ (or other acidic gases like SO₂, NO₂) was present in the gas mixture. Therefore, the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (filled with red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ molecules, the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with the drying agent, the alkaline solution, or the hot copper. Given that we expect the salts to contain nitrogen (a very common component of salts that decompose into gases), the most logical identity for Gas C is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition of the 7.20 g salt mixture produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol N₂\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n\nSince salts A and B decomposed completely into these gases, we can calculate the total moles of each element present in the initial mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All N comes from N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen comes from both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × Moles of H₂O) + (2 × Moles of O₂) = 0.20 mol + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nNow, let's check if the total mass of these elements matches the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches perfectly, confirming our analysis of the products is correct.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The combined empirical formula of the mixture (A+B) has an atomic ratio of H:N:O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25. To get whole numbers, we can multiply by 20, giving a ratio of H:N:O = 8:4:5.\n\nSo, the combined formula of one molecule of salt A plus one molecule of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to find two common salt formulas that add up to this total. The salts are composed of H, N, and O. The most common cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺), and the common anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻). Let's test these.\n\n*   Let Salt A be ammonium nitrite: **NH₄NO₂**. Its chemical formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n*   Let Salt B be ammonium nitrate: **NH₄NO₃**. Its chemical formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n\nLet's sum the formulas of our candidate salts:\n(N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = **N₄H₈O₅**\nThis perfectly matches the overall composition we derived. Thus, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\nWe can verify this with the moles and masses. M(NH₄NO₂) = 64 g/mol, M(NH₄NO₃) = 80 g/mol. Since the mixture is equimolar, let's say we have 'n' moles of each.\nTotal mass = n × M(NH₄NO₂) + n × M(NH₄NO₃) = n × (64 + 80) = 144n.\n144n = 7.20 g → n = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol.\nThe mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃. This is consistent with all the product amounts.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 2 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 3 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total atoms in both salts** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products from the Decomposition.**\n    The problem states that a 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. These gases are then analyzed.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a powerful dehydrating agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The problem states its weight did not change. This is a crucial piece of information: no CO₂ was produced, which means the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube, 0.80 g, is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that have bonded to the copper.\n        *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.00 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since the gas was O₂, each molecule contains two oxygen atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = Moles of O atoms / 2 = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas C remains. The volume is given at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas C and Check Mass Conservation.**\n    We can determine the identity of Gas C by using the law of conservation of mass. The initial mass of the salts must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n    *   Total initial mass = 7.20 g.\n    *   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O₂ produced = Moles of O₂ × Molar mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol × 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Total initial mass - Mass of H₂O - Mass of O₂\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass of C = Mass of C / Moles of C = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n    *   A gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is inert under these conditions is nitrogen (N₂). The presence of nitrogen is also suggested because we are dealing with the decomposition of salts. Therefore, Gas C is N₂.\n\n3.  **Determine the Elemental Composition and Identify the Salts.**\n    The decomposition products are 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂. From this, we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n    *   **Moles of N:** from 0.1 mol N₂ → 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 mol N.\n    *   **Moles of H:** from 0.2 mol H₂O → 0.2 × 2 = 0.4 mol H.\n    *   **Moles of O:** from 0.2 mol H₂O and 0.025 mol O₂ → (0.2 × 1) + (0.025 × 2) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\n    The empirical formula of the entire mixture is N₀.₂H₀.₄O₀.₂₅. To get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20, which gives N₄H₈O₅.\n\n    The problem states we have an *equimolar* mixture of two salts, A and B. This means the sum of the atoms in their chemical formulas must be N₄H₈O₅. We are looking for two common salts containing only N, H, and O that add up to this formula. Ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions are excellent candidates.\n\n    Let's test two likely salts:\n    *   **Ammonium Nitrate:** NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n    *   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\n    Let's sum their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    This perfectly matches the elemental composition we derived from the products.\n\n4.  **Verify with Reaction Stoichiometry and Molar Masses.**\n    Let's check if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these two salts produces the observed molar ratios of products (H₂O : O₂ : N₂ = 0.2 : 0.025 : 0.1 = 8 : 1 : 4).\n    *   Decomposition of NH₄NO₂: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   Decomposition of NH₄NO₃ (at high temp): 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\n    If we start with 'n' moles of each salt, the products are:\n    *   From `n` mol NH₄NO₂: `n` mol N₂ + `2n` mol H₂O\n    *   From `n` mol NH₄NO₃: `n` mol N₂ + `n/2` mol O₂ + `2n` mol H₂O\n    *   Total products: (n+n) mol N₂ + (n/2) mol O₂ + (2n+2n) mol H₂O = `2n` mol N₂ + `0.5n` mol O₂ + `4n` mol H₂O.\n    *   The molar ratio of products is H₂O : O₂ : N₂ = 4n : 0.5n : 2n = 8 : 1 : 4.\n    This matches the experimental ratio, confirming the identities of salts A and B.\n\n    We can also find 'n': from 0.025 mol of O₂, we have `n/2` = 0.025, so n = 0.05 mol.\n    The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n    *   Mass = (0.05 mol × 80.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 64.04 g/mol) = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g. This matches the initial mass.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms.**\n    The final step is to answer the question: \"Indicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\" This means the sum of the atoms in the individual formula units.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nAn equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, undergoes thermal decomposition. The products are analyzed to determine the composition of the original salts.\n\n**1. Analysis of Decomposition Products:**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** The mass of this tube did not change. This indicates that no acidic gases, such as CO₂, were produced. This rules out the presence of carbon in the original salts that could be oxidized to CO₂.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot Cu):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen gas (O₂): 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen gas exists as O₂ molecules, the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through the tubes, 2.24 L of gas C remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   According to Avogadro's law, 1 mole of any gas at STP occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n**2. Identification of Gas C and Mass Conservation:**\n\nThe initial mass of the mixture was 7.20 g. The total mass of the gaseous products must also be 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.025 mol × 32.0 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g\n*   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A diatomic gas that is unreactive with the reagents in the tubes and has a molar mass of 28 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**3. Elemental Composition and Identification of Salts A and B:**\n\nThe decomposition was done without air, so all the elements in the products (N, H, O) must have come from the original salts.\n*   **Total moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.1 mol of N₂ → 2 × 0.1 = 0.2 mol N.\n*   **Total moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.2 mol of H₂O → 2 × 0.2 = 0.4 mol H.\n*   **Total moles of Oxygen (O):** From 0.2 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂ → (1 × 0.2) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O, which strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\n*   The 0.4 mol of H corresponds to 0.1 mol of ammonium ions (NH₄⁺), since each ion has 4 H atoms (0.4 mol H / 4 = 0.1 mol NH₄⁺).\n*   The problem states the mixture is equimolar. If we have n moles of salt A and n moles of salt B, and each contains one ammonium ion, then 2n = 0.1 mol, which means n = 0.05 mol.\n*   The mixture contains 0.05 mol of salt A and 0.05 mol of salt B.\n*   Let's find the anions. The anions must contain the remaining nitrogen and all the oxygen.\n    *   N in anions = Total N - N in NH₄⁺ = 0.2 mol - 0.1 mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   O in anions = Total O = 0.25 mol.\n*   For 0.05 mol of each salt, if the anions are (NₓOᵧ) and (NₐOᵦ), then:\n    *   0.05x + 0.05a = 0.1  =>  x + a = 2\n    *   0.05y + 0.05b = 0.25 =>  y + b = 5\n*   The two most common nitrogen oxyanions are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n    *   If one anion is NO₂⁻ (x=1, y=2) and the other is NO₃⁻ (a=1, b=3):\n        *   x + a = 1 + 1 = 2 (Correct)\n        *   y + b = 2 + 3 = 5 (Correct)\n*   Therefore, the salts are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n*   **Verification by mass:**\n    *   M(NH₄NO₂) = 64 g/mol; Mass = 0.05 mol × 64 g/mol = 3.20 g\n    *   M(NH₄NO₃) = 80 g/mol; Mass = 0.05 mol × 80 g/mol = 4.00 g\n    *   Total Mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given information.\n\n**4.

In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Products from Experimental Data:**\n    *   Tube 1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂): Absorbs H₂O. Mass increase = 3.60 g. Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol H₂O**.\n    *   Tube 2 (Ca(OH)₂): Absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Mass did not change, so no acidic gases were formed. The salts do not contain carbon.\n    *   Tube 3 (Hot Cu): Reacts with O₂. Mass increase = 0.80 g. Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol O₂**.\n    *   Gas C (Remaining gas): Unreactive gas. Volume = 2.24 L at STP. Moles = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**. This gas is most likely N₂.\n\n2.  **Determine the Salts A and B:**\n    *   The products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) indicate the original salts contained only Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n    *   Common salts that fit this description and decompose on heating are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n    *   Decomposition reactions:\n        *   Salt B: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   Salt A: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n    *   The mixture is equimolar, so let `n` be the moles of each salt.\n    *   Total moles of products from `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B:\n        *   Moles O₂ = `n/2` (only from A)\n        *   Moles N₂ = `n` (from A) + `n` (from B) = `2n`\n        *   Moles H₂O = `2n` (from A) + `2n` (from B) = `4n`\n    *   Solve for `n` using the experimental data:\n        *   From O₂: `n/2` = 0.025 mol  => `n` = 0.05 mol\n        *   From N₂: `2n` = 0.10 mol  => `n` = 0.05 mol\n        *   From H₂O: `4n` = 0.20 mol  => `n` = 0.05 mol\n    *   The consistent value of `n` = 0.05 mol confirms the identities of the salts.\n\n3.  **Verify the Total Mass:**\n    *   Mass of A (NH₄NO₃) = 0.05 mol * 80 g/mol = 4.00 g\n    *   Mass of B (NH₄NO₂) = 0.05 mol * 64 g/mol = 3.20 g\n    *   Total Mass = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g.

Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of salts A and B is heated, and the resulting gases are passed through a series of tubes. We can identify the products and their quantities from the changes in the tubes' weights.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The weight increase is 3.60 g. Therefore, mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂).\n    *   The weight did not change. This is a crucial piece of information: **no acidic gases were produced** in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The weight increase is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted. Therefore, mass of O₂ produced = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Gas C did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. The most likely candidate for such an unreactive gas formed from the decomposition of salts is nitrogen (N₂). We will proceed with this assumption.\n\nSo, the decomposition of the 7.20 g mixture yielded:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol N₂\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nSince the salts completely decomposed into gases, we can find the elemental composition of the original mixture by calculating the moles of each element in the products.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All N comes from N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × Moles of H₂O) + (2 × Moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nNow, let's check if the total mass of these elements matches the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1 g/mol = 0.40 g\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 + 2.80 + 4.00 = 7.20 g.\n\nThe calculated mass matches the initial mass of the mixture. This confirms that salts A and B are composed only of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts are made of N, H, and O. This points to ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxoacids. The most common are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nLet's find the overall empirical formula for the mixture. The molar ratio of the elements is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get integers, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nSo, the combined formula of the (A+B) unit from the equimolar mixture is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nNow let's see if our candidate salts fit this combined formula.\n*   Formula of ammonium nitrate (Salt A): NH₄NO₃ → **N₂H₄O₃**\n*   Formula of ammonium nitrite (Salt B): NH₄NO₂ → **N₂H₄O₂**\n\nLet's add them together: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match! Therefore, the two salts are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Verify the Quantities**\n\nLet's confirm this identification by calculating the moles of each salt. The mixture is equimolar, so let 'n' be the moles of each salt.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = n × M(NH₄NO₃) + n × M(NH₄NO₂) = 7.20 g\n*   n × (80 + 64) = 7.20\n*   n × 144 = 7.20\n*   n = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂. The decomposition reactions must be:\n*   Decomposition of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   Products: 0.05 mol N₂ and 2 × 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   This leaves the remaining products to come from the decomposition of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃.\n    *   Remaining N₂ = 0.10 (total) - 0.05 = 0.05 mol\n    *   Remaining H₂O = 0.20 (total) - 0.10 = 0.10 mol\n    *   Remaining O₂ = 0.025 (total) - 0 = 0.025 mol\n*   So, the reaction for ammonium nitrate must be:\n    *   0.05 NH₄NO₃ → 0.05 N₂ + 0.10 H₂O + 0.025 O₂\n    *   Multiplying by 20 gives the molar ratio: 1 NH₄NO₃ → 1 N₂ + 2 H₂O + 0.5 O₂\n    *   Or, balanced with integers: **2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + 4H₂O + O₂**. This is a known decomposition reaction for ammonium nitrate under strong heating.\nEverything is consistent.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to answer the question: \"Indicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\" This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Atoms = 1 N (in NH₄) + 4 H + 1 N (in NO₃) + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Atoms = 1 N (in NH₄) + 4 H + 1 N (in NO₂) + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Mixture Composition**\n\nThe problem describes heating a mixture of two salts, A and B, which decompose entirely into a mixture of gases. This gas mixture is then passed through a series of tubes to identify its components.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of this tube is equal to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = mass / molar mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ (by forming a precipitate, CaCO₃). The problem states the weight of this tube did not change, which means there were no acidic gases like CO₂ in the mixture. This implies the original salts did not contain carbonate (CO₃²⁻) or similar anions.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases. The weight of the tube increased by 0.80 g, and CuO was formed. This increase in mass is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen is 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = mass / atomic mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    The source of this oxygen must be an oxygen-containing gas from the decomposition. Common gases from heating nitrogen-based salts include N₂O (nitrous oxide) and O₂.\n    Let's hypothesize the gas is N₂O. The reaction with copper is: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\n    From the stoichiometry, 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of O atoms to form CuO. Therefore, the amount of N₂O that reacted is 0.05 mol. This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    This final gas C must be chemically inert to all the reagents used. It consists of any inert gas from the original decomposition plus any inert gas formed in the tubes. Following our hypothesis for tube 3, the final gas C (0.10 mol) is composed of the N₂ produced from the N₂O reaction (0.05 mol) and another inert gas that was present from the initial decomposition. The amount of this initial inert gas is 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol. A very likely candidate for this inert gas is N₂ itself.\n\n**2. Determine the Initial Products**\n\nBased on the analysis, the gas mixture produced by heating salts A and B consists of:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe products contain only nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. The salts decompose completely into gases. This strongly suggests that A and B are ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxoacids. Let's consider the thermal decomposition of two common salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let's assume the mixture contains `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B. If A is NH₄NO₂ and B is NH₄NO₃:\n*   Decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ produces `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   Decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ produces `n` moles of N₂O and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\nThe total amounts of products would be:\n*   Total moles of N₂ = `n`\n*   Total moles of N₂O = `n`\n*   Total moles of H₂O = `2n + 2n = 4n`\n\nNow, let's compare this with our derived product amounts:\n*   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol  => `n` = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol => `n` = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of H₂O = 0.20 mol => `4n` = 0.20 => `n` = 0.05 mol\n\nThe results are perfectly consistent. The mixture contained 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Verify the Total Mass**\n\nLet's check if the mass of this mixture matches the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (moles of NH₄NO₂) × (Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂) + (moles of NH₄NO₃) × (Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃)\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass given in the problem.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe salts A and B are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in their chemical formulas).\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\n1.  **Analyze the Products from the Gas Analysis Train:**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This chemical is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced by the decomposition.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This tells us the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen gas (O₂) according to the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   **Gas C:** The remaining gas (2.24 L at STP) is inert to all the previous traps. In the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this gas is almost certainly nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Moles of Each Gaseous Product:**\n    *   **Moles of Water (H₂O):**\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 1.0*2 + 16.0 = 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol H₂O.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O₂):**\n        *   The mass increase (0.80 g) is from oxygen atoms (O). Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol O.\n        *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol O₂.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N₂):**\n        *   At standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n        *   Moles = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n3.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of Salts A and B:**\n    By the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts.\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the water (H₂O). Each H₂O molecule has 2 H atoms.\n        *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol H.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the nitrogen gas (N₂). Each N₂ molecule has 2 N atoms.\n        *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol N.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water (H₂O) and the oxygen gas (O₂).\n        *   Moles of O = (moles of H₂O) + 2 × (moles of O₂) = 0.20 mol + 2 × 0.025 mol = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\n4.  **Verify Composition and Identify the Salts:**\n    *   Let's check if the total mass of these elements equals the starting mass:\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g\n        *   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.8 g\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.0 g\n        *   Total Mass = 0.4 + 2.8 + 4.0 = 7.2 g. This matches the initial mass perfectly.\n    *   The total molar ratio of elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n    *   To get a simple whole number ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20): N₁ : H₂ : O₁.₂₅.\n    *   To eliminate the fraction, multiply all by 4: N₄ : H₈ : O₅.\n    *   This formula, N₄H₈O₅, represents the combined formula of one molecule of salt A and one molecule of salt B (since they are in an equimolar mixture). We must split this into two plausible salt formulas. Common salts containing only N, H, and O are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\n        *   Ammonium Nitrite: NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n        *   Ammonium Nitrate: NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n    *   Let's see if these two add up: (N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\n    *   So, salt A is NH₄NO₂ and salt B is NH₄NO₃.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   Count the atoms in the formula for salt A (NH₄NO₂): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   Count the atoms in the formula for salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   The total number of atoms is the sum of the atoms in both salts: 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nThe problem asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of two salts, A and B. To find this, we first need to identify the chemical composition of salts A and B based on the provided experimental data.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Gas Absorption Data:**\n    *   The gas mixture produced by heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) absorbed.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol H₂O**.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since the mass did not change, no such gases were present in the mixture. This tells us the salts A and B do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This means an oxidizing gas in the mixture transferred its oxygen atoms to the copper.\n        *   Mass of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol O atoms**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Gaseous Products:**\n    *   The elements present must come from the original salts. Since H₂O is produced, the salts contain Hydrogen and Oxygen. The lack of CO₂ and SO₂ rules out C and S. The remaining likely element is Nitrogen, as many nitrogen-containing salts decompose upon heating.\n    *   The gas that reacted with copper was an oxidizing gas. A common product from the decomposition of nitrogen salts is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is: N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂. In this reaction, one mole of N₂O provides one mole of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n    *   Therefore, the 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms came from **0.05 mol of N₂O**. This reaction also produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n    *   **Final Gas (C):** At the end, 2.24 L of an inert gas C remained at STP.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n        *   This inert gas is most likely Nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   The total N₂ at the end (0.10 mol) is the sum of the N₂ produced in Tube №3 (0.05 mol) and any N₂ that was part of the original gas mixture.\n    *   Original N₂ = Total N₂ - N₂ from N₂O reaction = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol N₂**.\n    *   So, the initial mixture of gases formed from heating the salts was:\n        *   0.20 mol H₂O\n        *   0.05 mol N₂O\n        *   0.05 mol N₂\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:**\n    *   We need to find two salts that decompose to yield these products. We are told the initial mixture of salts A and B was equimolar. Let's assume there were `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B.\n    *   Consider the thermal decomposition of common ammonium salts:\n        *   **NH₄NO₂ (Ammonium nitrite) → N₂ + 2H₂O**\n        *   **NH₄NO₃ (Ammonium nitrate) → N₂O + 2H₂O**\n    *   This pair of reactions perfectly matches our identified products. Let's check the stoichiometry.\n    *   Let Salt A be NH₄NO₂ and Salt B be NH₄NO₃. If the mixture is equimolar, `n` = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Decomposition of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ yields: 0.05 mol N₂ and 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n        *   Decomposition of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ yields: 0.05 mol N₂O and 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n    *   The total products are: 0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol H₂O. This perfectly matches our findings from step 2.\n\n4.  **Verify the Initial Mass:**\n    *   Let's check if 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ have a total mass of 7.20 g.\n        *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n        *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n        *   Total Mass = (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This confirms that salts A and B are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n    *   Total number of atoms in salts A and B = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the decomposition products to identify the original salts.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Moles**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (absorbs H₂O):** The mass increased by 3.60 g. This mass corresponds to the water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (absorbs acidic gases like CO₂):** The mass did not change. This is a crucial clue, indicating that no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (reacts with O₂):** The mass increased by 0.80 g. Red-hot copper reacts with oxygen (2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO). The mass gain is equal to the mass of the oxygen (O₂).\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ is 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products must equal the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g) due to the law of conservation of mass.\n*   Total Mass = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n*   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n*   7.20 g = 4.40 g + Mass(Gas C)\n*   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n\nNow we can determine the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass(C) = Mass(C) / Moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol.\nA common, non-acidic gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂). This suggests the original salts were nitrogen compounds.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe decomposition products are N₂, H₂O, and O₂. The original salts A and B must contain only Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. Since they are salts that decompose fully into gases, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. Let's consider the decomposition of ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n*   Ammonium Nitrite: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Ammonium Nitrate: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + 4H₂O(g) + O₂(g) (This decomposition pathway occurs at temperatures around 200-250°C).\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture. Let's assume we have `x` moles of NH₄NO₃ and `x` moles of NH₄NO₂. The balanced reactions for the mixture would be:\n`x` NH₄NO₂(s) → `x` N₂(g) + `2x` H₂O(g)\n`x` NH₄NO₃(s) → `x` N₂(g) + `2x` H₂O(g) + `0.5x` O₂(g)  (dividing the standard equation by 2)\n\nTotal moles of products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = `x` + `x` = `2x`\n*   Total H₂O = `2x` + `2x` = `4x`\n*   Total O₂ = `0.5x`\n\nNow let's compare the molar ratio of the products:\nN₂ : H₂O : O₂ = `2x` : `4x` : `0.5x` = 4 : 8 : 1.\n\nLet's check the experimental ratio from our calculations in step 1:\nN₂ : H₂O : O₂ = 0.10 mol : 0.20 mol : 0.025 mol\nDividing by the smallest value (0.025):\n(0.10/0.025) : (0.20/0.025) : (0.025/0.025) = 4 : 8 : 1.\n\nThe ratios match perfectly. Therefore, the salts A and B are Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n**4. Verify the Initial Mass**\nFrom the product ratios, we know that moles of O₂ = `0.5x`.\n*   0.025 mol = `0.5x`\n*   `x` = 0.05 mol.\nThis means the initial equimolar mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol * 80 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol * 64 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n*   Total Initial Mass = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g. This matches the value given in the problem.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\nNow we can find the total number of atoms in the formulas of the two salts.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of atoms in their respective formulas:\nTotal atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Treatment Process**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced by heating salts A and B is passed through three tubes. We can deduce the composition of the gas mixture by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H2O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H2O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H2O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO2 or SO2, which would form a precipitate (CaCO3 or CaSO3) and increase the mass of the tube. The fact that the mass did not change indicates that no such acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O2) or nitrogen oxides like N2O. The reaction is the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) is 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the reagents used.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   A very common inert gas produced in decomposition reactions of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N2).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nFrom the products, we can determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture. The total mass of the mixture is 7.20 g, which must equal the total mass of the products by the law of conservation of mass.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.2 mol of H2O produced.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 * Moles of H2O = 2 * 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.4 mol * 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H2O and in the oxidizing gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O from H2O = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Moles of O from the oxidizing gas = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol * 16.0 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The only remaining element must be nitrogen, which forms the final unreactive gas C (N2).\n    *   Assuming Gas C is N2, Moles of N atoms = 2 * Moles of N2 = 2 * 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Mass of N = 0.2 mol * 14.0 g/mol = 2.8 g.\n\n*   **Mass Check:** Total mass of elements = Mass(H) + Mass(O) + Mass(N) = 0.4 g + 4.0 g + 2.8 g = 7.2 g. This matches the initial mass of the salt mixture, confirming our elemental analysis.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts A and B are composed of H, N, and O. They are in an equimolar mixture. Let `n` be the number of moles of salt A and `n` be the number of moles of salt B. The entire sample consists of `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n\nFrom our elemental analysis, the `n(A) + n(B)` mixture contains:\n*   0.4 mol H atoms\n*   0.2 mol N atoms\n*   0.25 mol O atoms\n\nThe combined formula for one unit of A and one unit of B must have an atom ratio of H : N : O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25. To get integers, we multiply by 20, giving a ratio of 8 : 4 : 5.\nSo, the combined chemical formula of (A + B) is **H8N4O5**.\n\nWe need to find two common nitrogen- and oxygen-containing salts (likely ammonium salts of oxoacids) that add up to this formula. Let's consider:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH4NO2): Formula is H4N2O2.\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3): Formula is H4N2O3.\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(H4N2O2) + (H4N2O3) = H8N4O5.\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, we can identify Salt A as **NH4NO2** and Salt B as **NH4NO3** (or vice versa).\n\n**4. Verify the Hypothesis with Decomposition Reactions**\n\nLet's check if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these salts matches the observed products.\n*   `NH4NO2(s) -> N2(g) + 2H2O(g)`\n*   `NH4NO3(s) -> N2O(g) + 2H2O(g)`\n\nIf we heat `n` moles of each salt:\n*   Products: `n` moles of N2, `n` moles of N2O, and (2n + 2n) = `4n` moles of H2O.\n\nNow, let's trace these gases through the tubes:\n1.  **Tube 1:** Absorbs `4n` moles of H2O. From step 1, we know this is 0.2 mol. So, `4n = 0.2` => `n = 0.05` mol.\n2.  Gases leaving Tube 1 are `n` mol N2 and `n` mol N2O (i.e., 0.05 mol N2 and 0.05 mol N2O).\n3.  **Tube 2:** No reaction.\n4.  **Tube 3:** The oxidizing gas N2O reacts: `N2O + Cu -> N2 + CuO`.\n    *   0.05 mol of N2O reacts, consuming 0.05 mol of O atoms (Mass = 0.05*16 = 0.80 g). This matches the mass increase of the tube.\n    *   This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N2.\n5.  **Final Gas C:** The final gas is the initial N2 (0.05 mol) plus the N2 produced from N2O (0.05 mol). Total N2 = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.1 mol. This matches the moles of Gas C.\n\nAll calculations are consistent with A = NH4NO2 and B = NH4NO3, and n = 0.05 mol.\nA final check on mass: M(NH4NO2)=64 g/mol, M(NH4NO3)=80 g/mol.\nTotal Mass = 0.05 mol * (64 + 80) g/mol = 0.05 * 144 = 7.2 g. This is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH4NO2):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms (N)\n    *   4 Hydrogen atoms (H)\n    *   2 Oxygen atoms (O)\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH4NO3):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms (N)\n    *   4 Hydrogen atoms (H)\n    *   3 Oxygen atoms (O)\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nAlternatively, we found the combined formula for (A+B) is H8N4O5. The total number of atoms is 8 (H) + 4 (N) + 5 (O) = 17.\n\nThe correct answer is 17.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThe problem is solved by analyzing the products of the decomposition to identify the composition of the original salts.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe gas mixture from the decomposition was passed through a series of tubes, and the mass changes were recorded.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The weight did not change, so no acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase is due to the oxygen consumed.\n    *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO\n    *   Mass increase = Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n**2. Identification of Gas C and the Original Elements**\n\n*   By the Law of Conservation of Mass, the total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n    *   Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g\n    *   3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g\n    *   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 - 4.40 = 2.80 g.\n*   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass(C) = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A gas that is unreactive under these conditions with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**3. Determination of the Empirical Formula and Identity of the Salts**\n\n*   Since the products are N₂, O₂, and H₂O, the original salts A and B must contain Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O) atoms. Let's find the total moles of each element in the initial mixture.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × Moles(H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Total moles of N = 2 × Moles(N₂) = 2 × 0.1 = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O = (1 × Moles(H₂O)) + (2 × Moles(O₂)) = 0.2 + (2 × 0.025) = 0.25 mol.\n*   The molar ratio of elements in the combined salts (A+B) is N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, multiply by 20:\n    *   N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5.\n*   So, the combined formula of one mole of salt A plus one mole of salt B (as they are an equimolar mixture) is N₄H₈O₅.\n*   Given that these are salts formed from N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxoanions. The 8 hydrogen atoms strongly suggest the presence of two ammonium ions (2 x NH₄⁺), which account for N₂H₈.\n*   The remaining part, for the anions, is N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\n*   Two common anions that sum to N₂O₅ are the nitrite ion (NO₂⁻) and the nitrate ion (NO₃⁻).\n*   Thus, the salts are:\n    *   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n    *   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\n**4. Verification**\nLet's check the decomposition reactions.\n*   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   At 200°C, a relevant decomposition for ammonium nitrate is: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n*   The python code execution confirms that a mixture of 0.05 mol of each salt has a total mass of 7.20 g. Let's check the products from these amounts:\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: 0.05 mol N₂ and 0.1 mol H₂O.\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio): 0.05 mol N₂, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol H₂O.\n    *   **Total products:** 0.1 mol N₂, 0.2 mol H₂O, and 0.025 mol O₂. This perfectly matches our initial calculations.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B combined.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   **Total atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental results to determine the composition of the gaseous products.**\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such gases were produced. This suggests the salts do not contain carbon.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** This tube reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass gain is from oxygen atoms.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms captured = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen must come from an oxidizing gas in the mixture. Two main scenarios are possible:\n        *   **Scenario A:** The oxidizing gas is O₂. The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, we need 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol of O₂ gas.\n        *   **Scenario B:** The oxidizing gas is N₂O. The reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, we need 0.05 mol of N₂O gas. This reaction would also produce 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas (C):** 2.24 L of gas C at standard temperature and pressure (STP) remained.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all the reagents. Nitrogen (N₂) is the most likely candidate.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total elemental composition of the initial mixture.**\n\nLet's evaluate both scenarios to see if they are consistent.\n\n*   **Scenario A:** The products are 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂ (Gas C).\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × n(H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × n(N₂) = 2 × 0.1 = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (1 × n(H₂O)) + (2 × n(O₂)) = (1 × 0.2) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Let's check the total mass:\n        *   Mass = (0.4 mol H × 1 g/mol) + (0.2 mol N × 14 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16 g/mol)\n        *   Mass = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass of the mixture perfectly.\n\n*   **Scenario B:** The products are 0.2 mol H₂O and 0.05 mol N₂O. The 0.1 mol of remaining gas is N₂. However, the reduction of N₂O also produces N₂. The total N₂ (0.1 mol) is the sum of the N₂ initially present and the N₂ produced from N₂O.\n    *   n(N₂ from N₂O) = n(N₂O) = 0.05 mol.\n    *   n(N₂ initial) = Total n(N₂) - n(N₂ from N₂O) = 0.1 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, the decomposition products are: 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × n(H₂O) = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = (2 × n(N₂O)) + (2 × n(N₂)) = (2 × 0.05) + (2 × 0.05) = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (1 × n(H₂O)) + (1 × n(N₂O)) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   This yields the exact same elemental composition as Scenario A, which also sums to 7.20 g.\n\nBoth scenarios are consistent with the data and lead to the same conclusion: the 7.20 g mixture contains **0.4 mol H, 0.2 mol N, and 0.25 mol O**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify salts A and B.**\n\nThe salts contain only H, N, and O, and decompose fully into gases. This strongly points to ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids, specifically ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nThe decomposition reactions are:\n*   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   A common high-temperature decomposition of ammonium nitrate is: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\nThe problem states the mixture of salts A and B is equimolar. Let's assume we have *n* moles of each salt.\nIf A = NH₄NO₂ and B = NH₄NO₃:\n*   *n* NH₄NO₂ produces *n* mol N₂ and 2*n* mol H₂O.\n*   *n* NH₄NO₃ produces *n* mol N₂ + (n/2) mol O₂ + 2*n* mol H₂O (based on the 2:2:1:4 ratio).\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Total O₂ = n/2\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n\nNow we match this with our findings from Scenario A: n(N₂) = 0.1 mol, n(O₂) = 0.025 mol, n(H₂O) = 0.2 mol.\n*   From O₂: n/2 = 0.025  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**.\n*   Check N₂: Total N₂ = 2n = 2 × 0.05 = 0.1 mol. (Matches)\n*   Check H₂O: Total H₂O = 4n = 4 × 0.05 = 0.2 mol. (Matches)\n\nThe identification is correct. We have an equimolar mixture of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of atoms in the salts.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the formula units of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nThis is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem.\n\n**1. Identify and Quantify the Products**\n\nThe problem states that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B is heated, and the resulting gases are passed through a series of tubes. We analyze the mass change in each tube to identify the products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This chemical is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = 3.60 g. This is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol H₂O**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The mass did not change, which means **no acidic gases** were formed. This rules out salts containing carbon (carbonates, oxalates) or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase is from the oxygen.\n    *   Mass increase = 0.80 g. This is the mass of O₂ produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of O₂ ≈ 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol O₂**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After the other gases were removed, a final gas C remained.\n    *   Volume at STP = 2.24 L.\n    *   The molar volume of any ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol of Gas C**.\n\n**2. Identify Gas C and Verify Conservation of Mass**\n\nThe elements in the products (H, O, and the element(s) in Gas C) must have come from the original salts A and B. Since no acidic gases were formed, the most likely candidate for a stable, unreactive gas produced from a salt is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nLet's assume Gas C is N₂ and check if the mass is conserved:\n*   Mass of N₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(N₂) = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = **7.20 g**.\nThis perfectly matches the initial mass of the mixture. Our product identification is correct.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts are composed of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. These are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. The most common ones are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃). Let's check their decomposition reactions.\n\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite: **NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)**\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate at ~200°C: **2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + 4H₂O(g) + O₂(g)**\n\nThis matches our observed products: N₂, H₂O, and O₂.\nLet 'n' be the number of moles for each salt in the equimolar mixture.\n\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ we get: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ we get: `n` moles of N₂, `2n` moles of H₂O, and `0.5n` moles of O₂.\n\nNow, let's sum the products and compare them to our experimental results:\n*   Total O₂ produced = `0.5n`. We measured 0.025 mol. So, `0.5n = 0.025 mol`, which gives **`n = 0.05` mol**.\n*   Let's check this value with the other products:\n    *   Total N₂ = `n` (from nitrite) + `n` (from nitrate) = `2n` = 2 × 0.05 = **0.10 mol**. This matches our calculation.\n    *   Total H₂O = `2n` (from nitrite) + `2n` (from nitrate) = `4n` = 4 × 0.05 = **0.20 mol**. This also matches.\n\nThe salts A and B are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question is to find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in A and B** = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products of Decomposition:**\n    The problem describes the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gas mixture is analyzed by passing it through three tubes.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful desiccant (drying agent). It absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a limewater test. A milky precipitate (CaCO₃) would form if acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂ were present. Since the weight did not change, no such gases were formed. This implies the original salts do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO) via the reaction `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`. The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen consumed.\n        *   Mass increase = Mass of O = 0.80 g.\n        *   Wait, the reaction shows the mass increase is the mass of O₂, not just O. Let's re-examine. `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`. The tube contains copper initially. The mass *increase* is the mass of the other reactant, which is O₂.\n        *   Okay, wait. Let's think carefully. If we have a tube of copper, and we pass O₂ through it, the copper turns into CuO. The mass of the *tube's contents* increases. The increase is the mass of the oxygen that has become part of the solid CuO. So the 0.80 g increase is the mass of atomic oxygen, not diatomic oxygen gas.\n        *   Let's check the wording again: \"the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3)\". This phrasing usually means the mass of the absorbed/reacted substance. For red-hot copper, it reacts with O₂ gas. The mass increase of the *copper* itself is the mass of oxygen atoms. So, mass of O is 0.80g.\n            *   Moles of O from this source = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol. This came from O₂ gas, so Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol. This is consistent.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After the first three steps, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to the reagents used.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume at STP / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n        *   Given the elements likely present (H, O from H₂O and O₂), and the fact that we're dealing with decomposing salts, a very common inert gaseous product is Nitrogen (N₂). Let's assume Gas C is N₂.\n\n2.  **Determine Elemental Composition of the Original Salts:**\n    Since the products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂, the original salts must be composed of Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O). Let's calculate the total moles of each element in the 7.20 g mixture.\n\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the H₂O.\n        *   Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n        *   Mass of H = 0.4 mol × 1.008 g/mol ≈ 0.4 g.\n\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the N₂.\n        *   Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n        *   Mass of N = 0.2 mol × 14.01 g/mol ≈ 2.8 g.\n\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the produced H₂O and from the O that reacted with copper (which came from O₂ gas).\n        *   Moles of O from H₂O = 1 × Moles of H₂O = 0.2 mol.\n        *   Moles of O that reacted with Cu = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Total moles of O = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.00 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n\n3.  **Verify the Composition and Identify the Salts:**\n    *   **Total Mass Check:** Mass(H) + Mass(N) + Mass(O) = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.2 g. This matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our analysis.\n    *   **Find the Salt Formulas:** We have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Let's say we have `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n        *   The overall ratio of atoms in the mixture is H : N : O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25.\n        *   To get integers, multiply by 20: 8 : 4 : 5.\n    *   This H₈N₄O₅ represents the total atoms from one formula unit of salt A plus one formula unit of salt B. We are looking for two common salts made of H, N, and O that add up to this composition.\n    *   These salts are typically ammonium salts of oxyacids of nitrogen. Let's consider Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n        *   Chemical formula of NH₄NO₂ is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n        *   Chemical formula of NH₄NO₃ is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n    *   Let's check if the sum of their atoms matches our ratio:\n        *   Total H = 4 (from N₂H₄O₂) + 4 (from N₂H₄O₃) = 8. (Matches)\n        *   Total N = 2 (from N₂H₄O₂) + 2 (from N₂H₄O₃) = 4. (Matches)\n        *   Total O = 2 (from N₂H₄O₂) + 3 (from N₂H₄O₃) = 5. (Matches)\n    *   The identification is successful. Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃ (or vice-versa).\n\n4.  **Answer the Question:**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in the chemical formula unit of each salt.\n\n    *   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n        *   Number of atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n\n    *   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n        *   Number of atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n\n    *   **Total atoms in both salts** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nThe Python code executed previously confirmed this calculation by taking the same logical steps and computing the total atoms from the identified formulas (N₂H₄O₂ and N₂H₄O₃). The output `17` is correct.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup and results.**\n    The mixture of gases from the heated salts is passed through a series of tubes to identify and quantify the components.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since the weight did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This implies the salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper. Therefore, the mass of O₂ gas produced is 0.80 g.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** The gas that does not react in any of the tubes remains. We have 2.24 L of this gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of each product.**\n    *   **Moles of H₂O:**\n        Molar mass of H₂O = 2(1.01) + 16.00 = 18.02 g/mol.\n        Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Moles of O₂:**\n        Molar mass of O₂ = 2(16.00) = 32.00 g/mol.\n        Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Moles of Gas C:**\n        At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        Moles of C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas C.**\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the gaseous products must equal the initial mass of the salts.\n    *   Total mass = mass(H₂O) + mass(O₂) + mass(C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + mass(C)\n    *   mass(C) = 7.20 - 3.60 - 0.80 = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now, we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n        Molar Mass (C) = mass(C) / moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A diatomic gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is Nitrogen (N₂), since the molar mass of N is ~14 g/mol (2 * 14.01 = 28.02 g/mol).\n\n4.  **Determine the total elemental composition of the salts.**\n    The salts A and B must contain all the atoms found in the products (H, O, N), as nothing else was added.\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 0.20 mol H₂O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) = 0.40 mol H.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N) atoms:** 0.10 mol N₂ × (2 mol N / 1 mol N₂) = 0.20 mol N.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O) atoms:** (0.20 mol H₂O × 1 mol O/mol) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 mol O/mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\n5.  **Identify Salts A and B.**\n    The initial mixture contained an equimolar amount of salt A and salt B. Let `n` be the moles of A and `n` be the moles of B. The total atomic composition we found above (0.4 mol H, 0.2 mol N, 0.25 mol O) is distributed between `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n\n    Let's find the ratio of atoms in the combined \"formula unit\" of (A + B).\n    Ratio: H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25\n    To get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20:\n    Ratio: H : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5\n\n    So, the combination of one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B must contain a total of 8 H atoms, 4 N atoms, and 5 O atoms.\n\n    The salts are formed from H, N, and O. Common salts of this type are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxoacids. The ammonium ion is NH₄⁺.\n    *   Let's see if we can construct the salts using the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺), which contains 1 N and 4 H.\n    *   Our total H atom count is 8. This corresponds exactly to two ammonium ions (2 × 4 H = 8 H).\n    *   This implies that each salt, A and B, contains one ammonium ion:\n        *   Salt A = NH₄(Anion_A)\n        *   Salt B = NH₄(Anion_B)\n    *   Now let's account for the remaining atoms. We have used 2 N atoms and 8 H atoms.\n        *   Remaining N atoms = 4 (total) - 2 (in NH₄⁺ ions) = 2 N atoms.\n        *   Remaining O atoms = 5 (total) - 0 = 5 O atoms.\n    *   These remaining 2 N and 5 O atoms must make up the two anions (Anion_A and Anion_B). Common nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n    *   Let's check if they fit:\n        *   Nitrite (NO₂⁻) has 1 N and 2 O.\n        *   Nitrate (NO₃⁻) has 1 N and 3 O.\n    *   Total atoms from these two anions: (1+1) N and (2+3) O = 2 N and 5 O. This is a perfect match.\n\n    Therefore, the two salts are:\n    *   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n    *   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n6.  **Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in their formula units).\n    *   Number of atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Number of atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nFinal check of the mass:\nMolar Mass(NH₄NO₂) = 64.05 g/mol\nMolar Mass(NH₄NO₃) = 80.05 g/mol\nLet's find the number of moles `n` from the product data. Based on the decomposition 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O (or 1 NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + ½O₂ + 2H₂O), the 0.025 mol of O₂ must have come from `n` moles of NH₄NO₃, where 0.5*n = 0.025, so n = 0.05 moles.\nLet's check the mass with n = 0.05 mol:\nTotal Mass = 0.05 mol × (64.05 g/mol) + 0.05 mol × (80.05 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis confirms our calculations.\n\nThe total number of atoms in the formula units of salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nThe step-by-step reasoning has been laid out, and all calculations have been performed and verified.\n\n1.  **Analyze Products from Mass Changes:**\n    *   The mass increase in tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂) is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n        *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   The weight of tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂) did not change, indicating the absence of acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The mass increase in tube №3 (hot copper) is due to oxygen binding to form CuO.\n        *   Mass of Oxygen = 0.80 g.\n        *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol. This oxygen must have come from an oxidizing gas.\n    *   The remaining gas C is 2.24 L at STP.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol. Since it is inert to all the previous reagents, it is very likely Nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Determine Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture:**\n    *   The total mass of the gaseous products is the sum of the mass of water, the mass of oxygen that reacted, and the mass of the final gas C. Let's first determine the mass of gas C. Since we concluded it's N₂, its molar mass is 28 g/mol. Mass of Gas C = 0.1 mol * 28 g/mol = 2.8 g.\n    *   Let's check for conservation of mass. Total mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O that reacted with Cu) + Mass(Gas C before reacting) is tricky. It's better to work with the elemental masses from the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n    *   **Mass of Hydrogen:** From 0.2 mol of H₂O, moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol. Mass = 0.4 mol × 1 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n    *   **Mass of Oxygen:** From 0.2 mol of H₂O (0.2 mol O atoms) and 0.05 mol O atoms that reacted with Cu. Total moles of O atoms = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol. Mass = 0.25 mol × 16 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n    *   **Mass of Nitrogen:** The salts must be composed of H, N, and O. Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.4 g - 4.0 g = 2.8 g. Moles of N atoms = 2.8 g / 14 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n3.  **Identify the Salts A and B:**\n    *   The original mixture contained 0.4 mol H, 0.2 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n    *   The molar ratio of H:N is 0.4:0.2, which is 2:1. A combination of ammonium salts (NH₄⁺) gives a H:N ratio of 4:2 or 2:1, which fits perfectly. The salts are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   Let the salts be NH₄NOₓ and NH₄NOᵧ.\n    *   The mixture is equimolar, meaning moles of A = moles of B = n.\n    *   From the moles of Nitrogen: n(moles N in A) + n(moles N in B) = n(2) + n(2) = 4n = 0.2 mol N atoms. This gives n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   From the moles of Hydrogen: n(4) + n(4) = 8n = 0.4 mol H atoms. This gives n = 0.05 mol. The values are consistent.\n    *   From the moles of Oxygen: n(x) + n(y) = n(x+y) = 0.05(x+y) = 0.25 mol O atoms.\n    *   Solving for (x+y): x+y = 0.25 / 0.05 = 5.\n    *   The two most common stable nitrogen oxyanions are nitrite (NO₂⁻, so x=2) and nitrate (NO₃⁻, so y=3). 2 + 3 = 5.\n    *   Therefore, salt A is ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and salt B is ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Atoms:**\n    *   Atoms in one formula unit of salt A (NH₄NO₂): 2(N) + 4(H) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in one formula unit of salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2(N) + 4(H) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   The total number of atoms in salts A and B is the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each.\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Moles**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases is produced and passed through a series of tubes. We can identify the components of the gas mixture from the effects on these tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The mass of this tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO): 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, limewater, or hot copper. The most common unreactive gas produced from the decomposition of salts is nitrogen (N₂). Let's assume Gas C is N₂ and verify this with a mass balance check.\n\n**2. Verify Mass Conservation and Determine Elemental Composition**\n\nThe initial mass of the salt mixture was 7.20 g. By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the gaseous products must also be 7.20 g.\n\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ (assuming C is N₂) = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.1 mol × 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly. Our identification of the products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) and their quantities is correct. Now we can determine the total moles of each element in the original salts.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × n(H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Moles of N = 2 × n(N₂) = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in both H₂O and O₂. Moles of O = (1 × n(H₂O)) + (2 × n(O₂)) = (1 × 0.2) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nSo, the original 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B contained 0.4 mol of H, 0.2 mol of N, and 0.25 mol of O.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe are told the mixture is equimolar, meaning n(A) = n(B). Let's call this number of moles 'x'.\nThe elements present (H, N, O) and the fact that they are salts suggest they could be ammonium salts of oxygen-containing anions. Let's assume both salts contain the ammonium cation (NH₄⁺).\n\n*   Salt A = NH₄⁺X⁻\n*   Salt B = NH₄⁺Y⁻\n\nTotal moles of H atoms in the mixture = (moles of NH₄⁺ in A) × 4 + (moles of NH₄⁺ in B) × 4 = (x × 4) + (x × 4) = 8x.\nFrom our product analysis, we know the total moles of H is 0.4.\n*   8x = 0.4 mol  =>  x = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, we have 0.05 mol of salt A and 0.05 mol of salt B. Now let's determine the composition of the anions X and Y.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):**\n    *   Total N required = 0.2 mol.\n    *   N from the NH₄⁺ cations = (moles of NH₄⁺ in A) + (moles of NH₄⁺ in B) = x + x = 2x = 2(0.05) = 0.1 mol.\n    *   The remaining N must come from the anions: N(anions) = 0.2 - 0.1 = 0.1 mol.\n    *   Let Nₓ and Nᵧ be the number of N atoms per anion in X and Y. Then: (0.05 × Nₓ) + (0.05 × Nᵧ) = 0.1 => Nₓ + Nᵧ = 2.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):**\n    *   Total O required = 0.25 mol.\n    *   The NH₄⁺ cation contains no oxygen. All oxygen comes from the anions.\n    *   Let Oₓ and Oᵧ be the number of O atoms per anion in X and Y. Then: (0.05 × Oₓ) + (0.05 × Oᵧ) = 0.25 => Oₓ + Oᵧ = 5.\n\nWe need to find two common nitrogen-oxygen anions, X and Y, such that the total number of nitrogen atoms is 2 and the total number of oxygen atoms is 5.\nLet's consider the common anions nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n\n*   For NO₂⁻: N=1, O=2\n*   For NO₃⁻: N=1, O=3\n\nIf we set X = NO₂⁻ and Y = NO₃⁻:\n*   Total N atoms = N(NO₂⁻) + N(NO₃⁻) = 1 + 1 = 2. (This matches)\n*   Total O atoms = O(NO₂⁻) + O(NO₃⁻) = 2 + 3 = 5. (This also matches)\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: NH₄NO₂ (Ammonium nitrite)**\n*   **Salt B: NH₄NO₃ (Ammonium nitrate)**\n\nLet's do a final check with the total mass:\n*   M(NH₄NO₂) = 14.01×2 + 1.01×4 + 16.00×2 = 64.06 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol × 64.06 g/mol = 3.203 g.\n*   M(NH₄NO₃) = 14.01×2 + 1.01×4 + 16.00×3 = 80.06 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol × 80.06 g/mol = 4.003 g.\n*   Total Mass = 3.203 g + 4.003 g = 7.206 g. This matches the given 7.20 g.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 N in NH₄⁺ + 1 N in NO₂⁻ = 2 Nitrogen atoms\n    *   4 H in NH₄⁺ = 4 Hydrogen atoms\n    *   2 O in NO₂⁻ = 2 Oxygen atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 N in NH₄⁺ + 1 N in NO₃⁻ = 2 Nitrogen atoms\n    *   4 H in NH₄⁺ = 4 Hydrogen atoms\n    *   3 O in NO₃⁻ = 3 Oxygen atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the gaseous products and their quantities.**\n\nThe problem states that a 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B is heated and decomposes entirely into a mixture of gases. These gases are then analyzed.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube, 0.80 g, is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to the reagents used.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition products are: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original mixture.**\n\nThe atoms in the products must have come from the original salts A and B. Let's calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Moles of N = 2 × moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in both H₂O and O₂. Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the conservation of mass.**\n\nLet's calculate the total mass of the elements found and see if it matches the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Total mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly, confirming our analysis of the products is correct.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the salts A and B.**\n\nThe problem states we have an **equimolar mixture** of A and B. Let's say we have 'n' moles of A and 'n' moles of B. The total elemental composition of the mixture (2n moles of salt) is 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe ratio of elements in the combined formulas of (A + B) is:\nH : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20), which gives H:N:O = 2 : 1 : 1.25. Multiplying by 4 to clear the decimal gives:\n**H : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5**\n\nThis means that one formula unit of salt A plus one formula unit of salt B must contain 8 Hydrogen atoms, 4 Nitrogen atoms, and 5 Oxygen atoms.\n\nThe fact that the salts decompose completely into gases at 200°C strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxyanions. Let's test candidates:\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n\nLet's check if the sum of their formulas matches our derived ratio:\n(N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis perfectly matches the elemental ratio of N:H:O = 4:8:5. Therefore, salts A and B are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\nWe can also verify the number of moles.\n*   Mass of (NH₄NO₂ + NH₄NO₃) = M(N₂H₄O₂) + M(N₂H₄O₃) = 64.0 g/mol + 80.0 g/mol = 144.0 g/mol for the pair.\n*   Total mass of mixture = n × (M_A + M_B) = n × 144.0 g/mol = 7.20 g\n*   n = 7.20 / 144.0 = 0.05 mol.\n*   So the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃. This is consistent with our product analysis.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe final question is for the total number of atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   N: 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₂⁻) = 2 atoms\n    *   H: 4 atoms\n    *   O: 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   N: 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₃⁻) = 2 atoms\n    *   H: 4 atoms\n    *   O: 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B)**\n    *   Total = 8 + 9 = **17**\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Treatment and Determine Products**\n\nThe mixture of salts A and B is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g. This means 3.60 g of H₂O was produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change. This implies that no acidic gases like CO₂ were formed during the decomposition. Therefore, the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. It can also react with nitrogen oxides like N₂O (Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂).\n    *   The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that combined with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of oxygen (O) ≈ 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all these reactions, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, limewater, or hot copper. This indicates it is an inert gas. Given that the original substances are salts likely containing nitrogen (as many salts do), the most probable identity for gas C is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBased on the products, we can calculate the total moles of each element (H, N, O) in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and was absorbed by the copper.\n    *   Moles of O in H₂O = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Moles of O reacted with Cu = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass in the original mixture must be nitrogen.\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass of H - Mass of O\n    *   Mass of N = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Atomic mass of N ≈ 14 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of N = 2.80 g / 14 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n**3. Deduce the Formulas of Salts A and B**\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Let's say there are `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B. The total elemental composition is 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe ratio of the elements in the combined mixture is:\nH : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25\nTo get simple integers, we can multiply by 20:\nH : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5\n\nThis means that for every `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B, the total number of atoms corresponds to the formula H₈N₄O₅. We need to split this \"combined formula\" into two plausible salt formulas.\n\nSince they are salts, they consist of a cation and an anion.\n*   The H₈N₄ portion strongly suggests two ammonium cations (NH₄⁺), which would account for N₂H₈²⁺.\n*   This leaves a remaining \"anion part\" of N₂O₅, which must be split between two anions with a total charge of 2-.\n*   The common anions of nitrogen and oxygen are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   Let's see if they fit: NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ = [N₂O₅]²⁻. This is a perfect match for the remaining atoms and the required charge.\n\nTherefore, the two salts must be:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n\n**(Self-Consistency Check):** Let's verify this. If we have n=0.05 moles of each salt (total moles N = n*(2+2) = 4n = 0.2 => n=0.05), the mass would be 0.05*M(NH₄NO₃) + 0.05*M(NH₄NO₂). M(NH₄NO₃) = 80 g/mol, M(NH₄NO₂) = 64 g/mol. Total mass = 0.05 * (80 + 64) = 0.05 * 144 = 7.2 g. This matches perfectly. The decomposition reactions NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O and NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O also produce quantities that exactly match all the experimental data.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in their chemical formulas).\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B**\n    *   Total = 9 + 8 = 17\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products from the Experimental Data**\n\n    *   The mixture of salts A and B weighs 7.20 g and decomposes upon heating into only a mixture of gases.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H2O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H2O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H2O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** This is used to absorb acidic gases (e.g., CO2, SO2, NO2, N2O). Since its weight did not change, no such gases were formed.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Copper at high temperatures reacts with oxygen (O2) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The weight increase of 0.80 g corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Molar mass of O2 = 32 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O2 = 0.80 g / 32 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remained at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\n    *   The total mass of the gaseous products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n    *   Mass of products = mass(H2O) + mass(O2) + mass(C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + mass(C)\n    *   mass(C) = 7.20 - 4.40 = 2.80 g.\n    *   We can now calculate the molar mass of gas C:\n        *   Molar Mass(C) = mass(C) / moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol.\n    *   A common gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that does not react with the absorbents is nitrogen (N2). So, **Gas C is N2**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\n    *   The products of the decomposition are N2, H2O, and O2. Therefore, the original salts A and B must be composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n    *   Let's find the total moles of each element in the products, which must equal the total moles in the initial salt mixture:\n        *   **Moles of H atoms:** 0.20 mol H2O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H2O) = 0.4 mol H.\n        *   **Moles of N atoms:** 0.10 mol N2 × (2 mol N / 1 mol N2) = 0.2 mol N.\n        *   **Moles of O atoms:** (0.20 mol H2O × 1 O) + (0.025 mol O2 × 2 O) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\n4.  **Identify Salts A and B**\n\n    *   The problem states it is an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Let's find the overall empirical formula of the combined salts.\n    *   The mole ratio of the elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25.\n    *   To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20: (0.2 * 20) : (0.4 * 20) : (0.25 * 20) = 4 : 8 : 5.\n    *   So, the combined formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is **N4H8O5**.\n    *   We need to partition these atoms into two plausible salts that decompose into gases. Since the salts contain N and H, they are likely ammonium salts.\n    *   The H8 suggests the presence of two ammonium cations, `(NH4)2+`, which would account for N2H8.\n    *   The remaining atoms are `N4H8O5 - N2H8 = N2O5`. These atoms must form the two anions of the salts.\n    *   The common oxyanions of nitrogen are nitrite (NO2⁻) and nitrate (NO3⁻).\n    *   Let's check if they fit: `NO2⁻ + NO3⁻ = N2O5²⁻`. This perfectly matches the remaining atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are formed by combining one `NH4⁺` with `NO2⁻` and the other `NH4⁺` with `NO3⁻`.\n        *   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2)**\n        *   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3)**\n\n5.  **Verify the Decomposition and Stoichiometry**\n\n    *   Let's check if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these two salts yields the observed products. At the given temperature and conditions, plausible reactions are:\n        *   `NH4NO2 -> N2 + 2H2O`\n        *   `2NH4NO3 -> 2N2 + O2 + 4H2O` (A decomposition pathway for NH4NO3 that yields N2 and O2).\n    *   If we start with `n` moles of NH4NO2 and `n` moles of NH4NO3 (equimolar):\n        *   From `n` mol NH4NO2: produces `n` mol N2 and `2n` mol H2O.\n        *   From `n` mol NH4NO3: produces `n` mol N2, `n/2` mol O2, and `2n` mol H2O.\n    *   Total Moles of Products:\n        *   Total N2 = `n + n = 2n`\n        *   Total H2O = `2n + 2n = 4n`\n        *   Total O2 = `n/2`\n    *   The ratio of products is `N2 : H2O : O2` = `2n : 4n : n/2`, which simplifies to `4 : 8 : 1`.\n    *   Let's check the ratio from our experimental data:\n        *   `n(N2) : n(H2O) : n(O2)` = `0.10 : 0.20 : 0.025`. Dividing by 0.025 gives the ratio `4 : 8 : 1`.\n    *   The ratios match perfectly, confirming our identification of the salts is correct.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n    *   **Salt A (NH4NO2):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH4NO3):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nThis is a classic stoichiometry and qualitative analysis problem. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the salts and solve the question.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products\n\nThe initial mixture of salts A and B weighs 7.20 g and decomposes upon heating to form only gaseous products. We can identify these gases and their quantities by analyzing their journey through the tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This substance is a strong desiccant and absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol H₂O**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, or NO₂. The problem states that the weight of this tube did not change.\n    *   This is a crucial clue: **No acidic gases were formed.** This implies that the original salts do not contain elements like Carbon or Sulfur, or if they contain Nitrogen, it doesn't form acidic oxides like NO₂.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases, primarily oxygen (O₂) or nitrous oxide (N₂O).\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper to form copper(II) oxide (CuO).\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen atom (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms absorbed = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol O**.\n    *   If the gas was O₂, the moles of O₂ would be 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   If the gas was N₂O (reacting as Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂), the moles of N₂O would be 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, limewater, or hot copper. This indicates it is a relatively inert gas. Given the elements we're likely dealing with (see next step), this gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Deducing the Identity of the Salts\n\nNow we determine the total elemental composition of the products to figure out the composition of the original salts. The salts must only contain elements that form the identified products (H₂O, N₂, and an oxygen-containing gas) and do not leave a solid residue. This suggests the salts are composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). Salts that decompose completely into gases are typically ammonium salts of oxygen-containing anions.\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the gas reacting with copper is N₂O, as the decomposition of ammonium nitrate at 200°C typically produces N₂O and H₂O.\n\n**Hypothesis:** The products are H₂O, N₂, and N₂O. Salts A and B are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   **Decomposition reactions:**\n    *   Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite): NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)\n    *   Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate): NH₄NO₃ (s) → N₂O (g) + 2H₂O (g)\n\nLet's assume the initial equimolar mixture contains `x` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `x` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n1.  **Water (H₂O):** According to the reactions, `x` mol of NH₄NO₂ produces `2x` mol of H₂O, and `x` mol of NH₄NO₃ produces `2x` mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total H₂O produced = `2x + 2x = 4x`.\n    *   From our analysis, we know 0.20 mol of H₂O was produced.\n    *   `4x = 0.20 mol` ⇒ `x = 0.05 mol`.\n    *   So, the initial mixture contained **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂** and **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃**.\n\n2.  **Gases passed to Tube №3:** The gases entering the copper tube would be `x` moles of N₂ (from NH₄NO₂) and `x` moles of N₂O (from NH₄NO₃). With `x=0.05`, that's 0.05 mol N₂ and 0.05 mol N₂O.\n\n3.  **Reaction in Tube №3:** The N₂O reacts with the hot copper: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\n    *   `0.05 mol` of N₂O reacts, transferring `0.05 mol` of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n    *   Mass of oxygen = 0.05 mol * 16.0 g/mol = **0.80 g**. This exactly matches the experimental data.\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas C:** The final gas is the N₂ that was initially present plus the N₂ formed from the decomposition of N₂O.\n    *   Total N₂ = (N₂ from NH₄NO₂) + (N₂ from N₂O) = `x + x = 2x`.\n    *   Total moles of N₂ = 2 * 0.05 mol = **0.10 mol**. This exactly matches the amount of Gas C calculated from its volume.\n\n5.  **Initial Mass Verification:** Let's check if the mass of 0.05 mol of each salt equals 7.20 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Total Mass = (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = **7.20 g**. This also perfectly matches the initial data.\n\nOur hypothesis is confirmed. The salts A and B are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to answer the question: \"Indicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\" This means summing the atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the experimental data from the gas treatment**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases, most notably carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight did not change, it means no CO₂ (or other acidic gases like SO₂) was produced during the decomposition. This implies the salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This increase is purely due to the mass of oxygen atoms from an oxidizing gas in the mixture.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the reagents used.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **2. Determine the composition of the initial gas mixture**\n\nFrom step 1, we know the initial salts decomposed to produce a mixture of gases containing H₂O, N₂, and an oxidizing gas containing nitrogen and/or oxygen. Let's determine the identity and quantity of the oxidizing gas.\n\n*   The oxidizing gas contains 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms. Plausible candidates from the decomposition of nitrogen-based salts include O₂, N₂O, or NO.\n*   The temperature of decomposition is 200°C. This is a key piece of information for identifying the likely decomposition products of common salts.\n*   Let's consider the common thermal decomposition of ammonium salts:\n    *   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O (This reaction occurs between 170°C and 240°C).\n    *   At higher temperatures (>250°C), NH₄NO₃ can decompose differently: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O.\n*   Given the temperature of 200°C, the formation of N₂O from ammonium nitrate is the most likely reaction. This suggests our oxidizing gas is N₂O.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n*   If the oxidizing gas is nitrous oxide (N₂O), we need 0.05 mol of N₂O to provide 0.05 mol of O atoms.\n*   The reaction in tube №3 with hot copper is: N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂.\n*   This means 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted, producing 0.05 mol of N₂ gas inside tube №3.\n*   The final collected gas (Gas C) is 0.10 mol of N₂. This gas consists of any N₂ that entered tube №3 plus the N₂ produced from the N₂O reaction.\n    *   Total N₂ = (N₂ that entered) + (N₂ produced from N₂O)\n    *   0.10 mol = (N₂ that entered) + 0.05 mol\n    *   Solving for the amount of N₂ that entered, we get: (N₂ that entered) = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the mixture of gases produced by heating the salts was:\n*   **0.20 mol H₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol N₂O** (the oxidizing gas)\n*   **0.05 mol N₂** (the initial inert gas)\n\n### **3. Verify with Mass Conservation and Identify Salts A and B**\n\nLet's check if the total mass of these gaseous products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of H₂O = 0.20 mol * 18.0 g/mol = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of N₂O = 0.05 mol * 44.0 g/mol = 2.20 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.05 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 1.40 g\n*   **Total mass = 3.60 g + 2.20 g + 1.40 g = 7.20 g.**\nThis perfectly matches the initial mass. Our identification of the product mixture is correct.\n\nNow, we must find two salts, A and B, which are in an equimolar mixture and decompose to give this specific set of products.\n*   The products 0.05 mol N₂ and 0.2 mol H₂O (0.1 mol H₂O from each source) correspond perfectly to the decomposition of:\n    *   **0.05 mol of Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):**\n        0.05 NH₄NO₂(s) → 0.05 N₂(g) + 0.1 H₂O(g)\n    *   **0.05 mol of Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):**\n        0.05 NH₄NO₃(s) → 0.05 N₂O(g) + 0.1 H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states an equimolar mixture (0.05 mol of each) was used. This scenario fits all the data. Therefore:\n*   **Salt A is NH₄NO₂**\n*   **Salt B is NH₄NO₃**\n\n### **4. Calculate the total number of atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in salts A and B** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the products and calculate their amounts (moles).**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases is formed and passed through three tubes, and a final gas C remains. Let's analyze each step:\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong desiccant, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The problem states the weight of this tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were present in the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`. The weight increase of the tube is equal to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Gas C:** This is the gas that remained after passing through all three tubes. It is inert to water absorption, basic solutions, and hot copper.\n    *   Volume of Gas C = 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify Gas C and verify the law of conservation of mass.**\n\nThe total initial mass of the salt mixture was 7.20 g. This must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n\nNow we can determine the identity of Gas C by calculating its molar mass:\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   The molar mass of 28.0 g/mol corresponds to nitrogen gas (N₂). This also fits the chemical profile of being relatively inert.\n\nSo, the decomposition products are: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n**3. Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n\nLet's find the total moles of each element (N, H, O) present in the products, which must equal the moles of elements in the original salts A and B.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O, moles of H = 2 × 0.20 = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol of N₂, moles of N = 2 × 0.10 = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂, moles of O = (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nSo, the initial 7.20 g mixture contained 0.40 mol of H, 0.20 mol of N, and 0.25 mol of O.\n\n**4. Identify salts A and B.**\n\n*   The fact that the salts decompose completely into gaseous products at a relatively low temperature (200°C) strongly suggests they are ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-based oxyanions.\n*   Let's check if the cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺). The total moles of H atoms is 0.40 mol. If the cation is NH₄⁺, the total moles of NH₄⁺ ions would be 0.40 mol H / 4 H per ion = 0.10 mol.\n*   This 0.10 mol of NH₄⁺ ions would contribute 0.10 mol of N atoms. The total N atoms are 0.20 mol, so the remaining 0.10 mol of N must come from the anions.\n*   The total O atoms (0.25 mol) must also come from the anions.\n*   We have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total number of moles of salt is equal to the total moles of the cation, which is 0.10 mol. Since the mixture is equimolar:\n    *   Moles of salt A = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Moles of salt B = 0.05 mol.\n*   Now, let's find the formulas of the two anions. The 0.05 mol of anion A and 0.05 mol of anion B must together contain 0.10 mol of N and 0.25 mol of O. Let the anions be (NₓOᵧ)⁻ and (NₐOᵦ)⁻.\n    *   For Nitrogen: (0.05 mol × x) + (0.05 mol × a) = 0.10 mol N ⇒ x + a = 2.\n    *   For Oxygen: (0.05 mol × y) + (0.05 mol × b) = 0.25 mol O ⇒ y + b = 5.\n*   The most common nitrogen oxyanions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻). Let's see if they fit.\n    *   For nitrate (NO₃⁻): one N and three O atoms (x=1, y=3).\n    *   For nitrite (NO₂⁻): one N and two O atoms (a=1, b=2).\n    *   Check: x + a = 1 + 1 = 2. (Correct)\n    *   Check: y + b = 3 + 2 = 5. (Correct)\n*   Thus, the two salts are Ammonium Nitrate and Ammonium Nitrite.\n    *   **Salt A = NH₄NO₃**\n    *   **Salt B = NH₄NO₂**\n\n**5. Verify the initial mass.**\n\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14+4(1)+14+3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14+4(1)+14+2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 × 80 = 4.00 g.\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 × 64 = 3.20 g.\n*   Total mass = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g. This matches the initial weight perfectly.\n\n**6. Calculate the total number of atoms in salts A and B.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n*   Number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A (NH₄NO₃) = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n*   Number of atoms in one formula unit of salt B (NH₄NO₂) = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n*   Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the gaseous products and their quantities from the experimental data.**\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of this tube is equal to the mass of water produced by the decomposition.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases, most notably carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the mass of this tube did not change, no acidic gases like CO₂ were produced. This implies that the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: Hot copper acts as a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, which means the copper was oxidized. This is typically a reaction with O₂ or another oxygen-containing oxidizing gas like N₂O. The mass increase of the copper tube is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that have chemically bonded to the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   The molar mass of atomic oxygen is 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas C**: This is the gas that did not get absorbed or react in the previous three tubes. Its volume is given at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Volume of Gas C = 2.24 L.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n\nThe total mass of the products must equal the mass of the reactants (7.20 g). Let's calculate the mass of the elements in the gaseous products.\n*   Mass of Hydrogen = Moles(H₂O) * 2 * Molar Mass(H) = 0.20 mol * 2 * 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n*   Mass of Oxygen = Moles(H₂O) * 1 * Molar Mass(O) + Moles(O atoms) * Molar Mass(O) = 0.20 mol * 16.0 g/mol + 0.05 mol * 16.0 g/mol = 3.20 g + 0.80 g = 4.00 g.\n*   The remaining mass must belong to the element(s) that make up Gas C. Total mass = Mass(H) + Mass(O) + Mass(C_element) = 7.20 g.\n*   Mass(C_element) = 7.20 g - 0.4 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n\nGas C is inert to the reagents used. Nitrogen gas (N₂) is the most plausible candidate, especially from heating nitrogen-containing salts. Let's check if this fits.\n*   If Gas C is N₂, its molar mass is 28.0 g/mol.\n*   Mass of 0.10 mol N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\nThis perfectly matches the remaining mass. Therefore, the original salts A and B are composed only of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n**Step 3: Propose the identities of salts A and B.**\n\nSince salts A and B are composed of N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of oxyacids of nitrogen. The most common ones are:\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n\nLet's hypothesize that A and B are these two salts. We are told the mixture is equimolar, meaning moles(A) = moles(B) = n.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the hypothesis with the reaction stoichiometry.**\n\nLet's consider the thermal decomposition reactions for these salts around 200°C.\n*   **NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)**\n*   **NH₄NO₃ (s) → N₂O (g) + 2H₂O (g)**\n\nIn this scenario, the initial gas mixture from decomposing n moles of each salt would be:\n*   H₂O: 2n (from nitrite) + 2n (from nitrate) = 4n mol\n*   N₂: n mol (from nitrite)\n*   N₂O: n mol (from nitrate)\n\nNow, let's trace these gases through the tubes:\n1.  **Tube 1:** Absorbs 4n moles of H₂O.\n2.  **Tube 2:** N₂ and N₂O pass through unreacted.\n3.  **Tube 3:** The oxidizing gas N₂O reacts with hot copper: **N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO**. This reaction consumes n moles of N₂O and adds n moles of oxygen atoms to the copper tube.\n4.  **Final Gas C:** The final gas is the N₂ from the nitrite decomposition (n mol) plus the N₂ from the N₂O reaction (n mol). Total moles of Gas C = n + n = 2n.\n\nNow let's match this stoichiometry with our experimental mole calculations:\n*   Moles of H₂O = 4n = 0.20 mol  =>  n = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of O atoms = n = 0.05 mol  =>  n = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of Gas C = 2n = 0.10 mol  =>  n = 0.05 mol\n\nAll three results consistently give **n = 0.05 mol**. This confirms that the mixture contains 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\n**Step 5: Final verification with total mass.**\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 80.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64.0 g/mol) = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass given in the problem. The identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**Step 6: Answer the question.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in their chemical formulas).\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe total number of atoms in both salts combined is 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nThe problem has been solved correctly in the previous steps. Here is a summary of the logical procedure leading to the final answer.\n\n**1. Data Analysis:**\n*   **Tube 1 (H₂O absorber):** Mass increased by 3.60 g. This means 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol of H₂O** was produced.\n*   **Tube 2 (Acidic gas absorber):** No mass change, so no acidic gases (CO₂, SO₂, NO₂) were formed. The salts do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n*   **Tube 3 (Reacts with O₂/N₂O):** Mass increased by 0.80 g. This is the mass of oxygen atoms transferred to the copper. Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol of O atoms**.\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 L at STP. This inert gas is N₂. Moles = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol of N₂**.\n\n**2. Reconstructing the Decomposition Products:**\n*   The oxidizing gas that reacted in Tube 3 must have been N₂O, as it's a common decomposition product and isn't acidic. The reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n*   To provide 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms, **0.05 mol of N₂O** must have reacted. This reaction also produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   The total 0.10 mol of N₂ collected at the end is the sum of N₂ from the original decomposition plus the 0.05 mol of N₂ from the N₂O reaction.\n*   Therefore, the original decomposition must have produced 0.10 - 0.05 = **0.05 mol of N₂**.\n*   In summary, the thermal decomposition produced: **0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.**\n\n**3. Determining the Elemental Composition:**\n*   From the products, we can find the total moles of each element in the original salt mixture.\n    *   **Moles H:** 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 = **0.40 mol H**\n    *   **Moles N:** (0.05 mol N₂ × 2) + (0.05 mol N₂O × 2) = **0.20 mol N**\n    *   **Moles O:** (0.20 mol H₂O × 1) + (0.05 mol N₂O × 1) = **0.25 mol O**\n\n**4. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms:**\n*   The mole ratio of elements in the combined salts (A+B) is H:N:O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25.\n*   To get the simplest whole-number ratio for the atoms in a combined formula unit of (A+B), we multiply by 20:\n    H: (0.40 × 20) = 8\n    N: (0.20 × 20) = 4\n    O: (0.25 × 20) = 5\n*   The combined formula representing one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **H₈N₄O₅**.\n*   The total number of atoms is the sum of the subscripts: 8 + 4 + 5 = **17**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Reaction Products from Experimental Data**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of salts A and B is heated, and the resulting gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes. We can deduce the composition of the gas mixture from the changes in the tubes' weights.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol H₂O**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The problem states its weight did not change, which means **no CO₂ was produced**. This rules out carbonates, oxalates, or other salts that would decompose to form CO₂.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The weight of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This means an oxidizing gas reacted with the copper, and the 0.80 g mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol O**.\n    *   Common oxidizing gases that decompose from salts are O₂ and N₂O. If the gas was O₂, its moles would be `moles(O)/2` = 0.05/2 = **0.025 mol O₂**. If the gas was N₂O, its moles would be `moles(O)` = **0.05 mol N₂O**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert under the given conditions.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   This inert gas is almost certainly **Nitrogen (N₂) **, a common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n### **2. Determine the Overall Composition and Identify Salts**\n\nLet's check the mass balance. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\nTotal mass = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(N₂) + Mass(oxidizing gas).\n\n*   Let's assume the oxidizing gas is **O₂**.\n    *   Mass H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Mass O₂ = 0.025 mol * 32.0 g/mol = 0.80 g\n    *   Mass N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n    *   Total Mass = 3.60 + 0.80 + 2.80 = **7.20 g**.\n    *   This perfectly matches the initial mass. This confirms that the products are **0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂**.\n\nNow we need to find two salts, A and B, in an equimolar mixture, that produce these products in this ratio upon heating. Ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions are the most likely candidates. Let's consider **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite:**\n    NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate (at ~200-250°C):**\n    2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + 4H₂O(g) + O₂(g)\n    *Note: Decomposition of NH₄NO₃ can also produce N₂O, but the mass balance pointed us to O₂ as the product.*\n\nLet the mixture contain `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ (equimolar).\nLet's calculate the total moles of products:\n*   **Total O₂:** Only comes from NH₄NO₃. From the balanced equation, `n` mol of NH₄NO₃ produces `n/2` mol of O₂.\n    *   We know 0.025 mol of O₂ was formed. So, `n/2 = 0.025` mol => **`n = 0.05` mol**.\n\nThis means the mixture contained 0.05 mol of salt A and 0.05 mol of salt B. Let's verify the amounts of the other products with `n=0.05`:\n*   **Total N₂:**\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: `n` = 0.05 mol N₂\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃: `n` = 0.05 mol N₂\n    *   Total N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = **0.10 mol**. This matches our data.\n\n*   **Total H₂O:**\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: `2n` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃: `2n` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O\n    *   Total H₂O = 0.10 + 0.10 = **0.20 mol**. This also matches our data.\n\nThe identification of salts A and B as **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** is correct.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to sum the number of atoms in the chemical formulas of both salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both salts** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThe result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products of the Reaction:**\n    The problem states that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B is heated, producing a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through a series of tubes, and the change in weight of the tubes tells us what gases were produced and in what quantities.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O).\n        *   The weight increase is 3.60 g. Therefore, the mass of H₂O produced is 3.60 g.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n        *   The weight of this tube did not change. This is a crucial piece of information: **no CO₂ was produced**. This rules out salts containing carbonate (CO₃²⁻) or oxalate (C₂O₄²⁻) ions.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n        *   The weight increase is due to the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Mass of oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O is 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since the gas is molecular oxygen (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas C and Verify Conservation of Mass:**\n    The total mass of the starting salts (7.20 g) must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.025 mol × 32.0 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂)\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass of C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   The most common gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that would be produced from heating salts is nitrogen gas (N₂), with M ≈ 14.01 × 2 = 28.02 g/mol. This is also consistent with the fact that no carbon was detected (no CO₂). So, **Gas C is N₂**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture:**\n    The atoms in the product gases (H₂O, O₂, N₂) must have come from the original salts A and B. We can calculate the total moles of each element.\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Moles(H) = 2 × Moles(H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Moles(N) = 2 × Moles(N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** O is in H₂O and O₂. Moles(O) = Moles(O in H₂O) + Moles(O in O₂) = 0.20 mol + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n    So, the 7.20 g mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O. The mole ratio is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives N₈H₄O₅, which is wrong. N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25 -> 20:40:25 -> simplified by 5 gives **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n4.  **Identify Salts A and B:**\n    We have an equimolar mixture of A and B. Let's say there are `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n    *   The total chemical formula of the `n`(A+B) mixture that was heated is N₀.₂₀H₀.₄₀O₀.₂₅.\n    *   This means the formula of one \"unit\" of (A+B) is proportional to N₄H₈O₅.\n    *   The molar mass of a N₄H₈O₅ unit is 4(14.01) + 8(1.008) + 5(16.00) ≈ 56 + 8 + 80 = 144 g/mol.\n    *   The total mass of the mixture is `n` × (Molar Mass of A + Molar Mass of B).\n    *   If the formula of (A+B) is N₄H₈O₅, then M(A)+M(B) = 144 g/mol.\n    *   The amount of this combined unit is `n` = Total Mass / Combined Molar Mass = 7.20 g / 144 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, the mixture consists of **0.05 mol of salt A** and **0.05 mol of salt B**.\n\n    Now we need to find two salts, A and B, whose formulas add up to N₄H₈O₅ and are consistent with the problem's conditions (decomposing to gas, no C, etc.).\n    *   The presence of nitrogen and hydrogen suggests ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts. The H₈ in the combined formula N₄H₈O₅ suggests two NH₄⁺ ions (2 × 4 = 8 H).\n    *   Let's try splitting N₄H₈O₅ into two common ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   Candidate salts: Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n    *   Let's check their formulas:\n        *   NH₄NO₃ -> **N₂H₄O₃**\n        *   NH₄NO₂ -> **N₂H₄O₂**\n    *   Sum of formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Let's check their molar masses:\n        *   M(NH₄NO₃) = 80.0 g/mol\n        *   M(NH₄NO₂) = 64.0 g/mol\n    *   Sum of molar masses: 80.0 + 64.0 = **144.0 g/mol**. This also matches perfectly.\n\n    Thus, the salts A and B are **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their individual chemical formulas.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total atoms** = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the gas treatment process to identify the products of the decomposition.**\n    1.  The mixture of gases is first passed through a tube with anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂, which is a strong desiccant that absorbs water. The mass of this tube increased by 3.60 g. This means the mass of water (H₂O) produced is 3.60 g.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n    2.  Next, the remaining gases are passed through a Ca(OH)₂ solution. This solution absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The mass of this tube did not change, which implies that no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition of the salts.\n\n    3.  Then, the gases are passed through a tube with red-hot copper. Copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g. This increase is equal to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.80 g.\n        *   The gas must have been O₂. Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are 0.05 mol atoms / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n    4.  Finally, 2.24 liters of a remaining gas C were collected at standard temperature and pressure (STP). At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n        *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the identity of Gas C and the total composition of the gas mixture.**\n    *   The total mass of the initial salts was 7.20 g. By the law of conservation of mass, this must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n    *   Total Mass = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   7.20 g = 4.40 g + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   We can now find the molar mass of Gas C:\n        *   Molar Mass(Gas C) = Mass(Gas C) / Moles(Gas C) = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n    *   A gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is unreactive towards Ca(OH)₂ and hot copper is most certainly Nitrogen (N₂).\n\n*   **Step 3: Summarize the decomposition products.**\n    *   H₂O: 0.2 mol\n    *   O₂: 0.025 mol\n    *   N₂: 0.1 mol\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the salts A and B.**\n    *   The products are H₂O, N₂, and O₂. This indicates the salts are composed of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. Since they are salts that decompose upon heating, ammonium salts of oxyanions are likely candidates.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that the salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n        *   Decomposition of ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n        *   Decomposition of ammonium nitrate (strong heating): 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n    *   The mixture of salts A and B is equimolar. Let 'n' be the moles of each salt.\n        *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01 + 4*1.01 + 14.01 + 2*16.00 = 64.04 g/mol.\n        *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01 + 4*1.01 + 14.01 + 3*16.00 = 80.05 g/mol.\n    *   The total mass of the mixture is 7.20 g:\n        *   n * M(NH₄NO₂) + n * M(NH₄NO₃) = 7.20 g\n        *   n * (64.04 + 80.05) = 7.20 g\n        *   n * (144.09) = 7.20 g\n        *   n = 7.20 / 144.09 ≈ 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, we have 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃. Let's see if this produces the correct amount of gas.\n        *   From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂:\n            *   N₂ produced = 0.05 mol\n            *   H₂O produced = 2 * 0.05 mol = 0.1 mol\n        *   From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃:\n            *   Using the 2:2:1:4 ratio for the reaction 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O:\n            *   N₂ produced = (2/2) * 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n            *   O₂ produced = (1/2) * 0.05 mol = 0.025 mol\n            *   H₂O produced = (4/2) * 0.05 mol = 0.1 mol\n    *   Total products:\n        *   Total N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.1 mol. (Matches our finding)\n        *   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol. (Matches our finding)\n        *   Total H₂O = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 mol. (Matches our finding)\n    *   The hypothesis is correct. The salts A and B are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each.\n    *   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemistry problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of the Decomposition**\n\nThe problem states that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 g, is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. This gas mixture is then passed through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase is 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 2(1.0) + 16.0 = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, etc.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change, meaning no acidic gases were formed in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxidizing agents, most commonly oxygen (O₂). The problem states CuO is formed (2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO). The increase in mass is due to the oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   The mass increase is 0.80 g, which corresponds to the mass of O₂ produced.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2 * 16.0 = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   Note: Hot copper also reacts with nitrous oxide (N₂O) via Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. If N₂O were produced, the mass increase would still correspond to the mass of oxygen atoms, and it would produce N₂ gas. We will consider this later.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nLet's check the total mass of the products identified so far.\n*   Total initial mass = 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n*   From the law of conservation of mass, we can find the mass of Gas C:\n    Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂)\n    Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Now we can determine the molar mass of Gas C:\n    Molar Mass(Gas C) = Mass(Gas C) / Moles(Gas C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that is unreactive towards Ca(OH)₂ is nitrogen (N₂). So, **Gas C is N₂**.\n\n**3. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Reactants**\n\nSince the salts decomposed completely into H₂O, O₂, and N₂, the original salts A and B must be composed only of Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O).\nLet's calculate the total moles of each element in the products, which must equal the moles in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n*   **Moles of H atoms:** From 0.20 mol of H₂O, we have 2 × 0.20 = **0.40 mol H**.\n*   **Moles of N atoms:** From 0.10 mol of N₂, we have 2 × 0.10 = **0.20 mol N**.\n*   **Moles of O atoms:** From 0.20 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂, we have (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol O**.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe reactants are salts composed of N, H, and O. This strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. The most common ones are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂). Let's test this hypothesis.\n*   Let Salt A = **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) -> Formula: N₂H₄O₂**\n*   Let Salt B = **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) -> Formula: N₂H₄O₃**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let `n` be the number of moles of Salt A and `n` be the number of moles of Salt B.\nThe total moles of each element in the initial mixture are:\n*   Total moles of N = (2 N per formula A) × n + (2 N per formula B) × n = 2n + 2n = **4n**\n*   Total moles of H = (4 H per formula A) × n + (4 H per formula B) × n = 4n + 4n = **8n**\n*   Total moles of O = (2 O per formula A) × n + (3 O per formula B) × n = 2n + 3n = **5n**\n\nNow we equate these expressions with the moles of elements we calculated from the products:\n*   For N: 4n = 0.20 mol => n = 0.05 mol\n*   For H: 8n = 0.40 mol => n = 0.05 mol\n*   For O: 5n = 0.25 mol => n = 0.05 mol\n\nAll three calculations yield **n = 0.05 mol**. This is a consistent result, confirming our hypothesis.\n\n**5. Final Check with Initial Mass**\n\nLet's check if the mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ equals the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.0+4(1.0)+14.0+2(16.0) = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.0+4(1.0)+14.0+3(16.0) = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (n × M(A)) + (n × M(B)) = (0.05 mol × 64.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.0 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly. Our identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17 atoms**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
