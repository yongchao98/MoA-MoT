The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom—a hydrogen atom on an sp3-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n    1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone, C₆H₄O₂):**\n        *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl groups at opposite positions.\n        *   The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds within the ring.\n        *   These alpha-carbons are sp2-hybridized, not sp3-hybridized.\n        *   Since there are no alpha-hydrogens on sp3-hybridized carbons, benzoquinone cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (C₆H₆O₃):**\n        *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons between the carbonyls (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups.\n        *   These carbons (C2, C4, C6) are sp3-hybridized and are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons has two alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   Due to the presence of these alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can and does exhibit keto-enol tautomerism. It readily converts to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and highly stable compound.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism. Therefore, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Part B)**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Methyl lactate):**\n        *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        *   This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since the carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and thus exhibits optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n    2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is the *trans* isomer, meaning the two methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃) groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n        *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there are no chiral centers.\n        *   The molecule possesses a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the C=C bond), which makes it achiral.\n        *   Since the molecule is achiral, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism. Therefore, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer:**\n    *   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is an equilibrium between two constitutional isomers, most commonly keto-enol tautomers. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This alpha-hydrogen must be on an sp3 hybridized carbon for the process to occur readily.\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   Structure: It is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 4, and double bonds between carbons 2-3 and 5-6.\n    *   The alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyls) are C2, C6, C3, and C5.\n    *   All these alpha-carbons are sp2 hybridized because they are part of the ring's double bonds.\n    *   While they do have hydrogen atoms attached, removing one of these protons is difficult, and the process would disrupt the stable conjugated system of the molecule. Standard keto-enol tautomerism involves an alpha-hydrogen on an sp3 carbon. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   Structure: It is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp3 hybridized.\n    *   The alpha-carbons are C2, C4, and C6. Each of these carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   These hydrogens are acidic because they are located between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   The presence of these sp3 alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerization to form its enol, which is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and therefore very stable.\n    *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n    *   Let's analyze the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the -OH group.\n    *   This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since it is bonded to four different groups, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n    *   Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   Structure: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is the trans isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate.\n    *   The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond, and the structure is planar.\n    *   It does not contain any chiral centers (no carbon is bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making it achiral.\n    *   Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where molecules can interconvert by the migration of an atom (usually hydrogen) and a shift in the location of a double bond. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one **alpha-hydrogen**, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (the alpha-carbon). This alpha-carbon must be sp³ hybridized.\n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** Its structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4) and two C=C double bonds. The molecular formula is C₆H₄O₂. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized, not sp³. They do not have the type of alpha-hydrogens required for standard keto-enol tautomerism. Converting it to its corresponding \"enol\" form (hydroquinone, C₆H₆(OH)₂) would require adding two hydrogen atoms, changing the molecular formula from C₆H₄O₂ to C₆H₆O₂. Since tautomers must have the same molecular formula, this is a redox reaction, not tautomerism. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Its structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The molecular formula is C₆H₆O₃. The carbons between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are sp³ hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms (-CH₂-). These are alpha-hydrogens. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because the negative charge on the resulting carbanion (enolate) is stabilized by two adjacent carbonyl groups. This compound readily undergoes tautomerism to form its enol, **phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene)**, which has the same molecular formula (C₆H₆O₃). The enol form is aromatic and thus exceptionally stable. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore **will show optical isomerism** (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond. The molecule has a center of symmetry and is planar, meaning it is superimposable on its mirror image. It contains no chiral centers. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer**\n\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n    This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where isomers can interconvert through a chemical reaction, most commonly the migration of a proton. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon). This hydrogen is called an α-hydrogen.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Let's examine its structure. It is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are α-carbons to two carbonyl groups each. Each of these α-carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms (α-hydrogens). The presence of these acidic α-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo tautomerization to form its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and therefore very stable, meaning cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily exhibits tautomerism.\n         \n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** Let's examine its structure. It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4). The α-carbons (positions 2, 3, 5, and 6) are part of carbon-carbon double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). They do not have the typical structure of an α-carbon (sp³ hybridized) from which a proton can be easily removed to form an enol. Therefore, benzoquinone does not have α-hydrogens in the conventional sense required for keto-enol tautomerism. It cannot tautomerize.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Let's draw its structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-C(=O)OCH₃. Let's analyze the carbon atom at position 2 (the one with the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-C(=O)OCH₃)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and thus exhibits optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OC(=O)CH=CH(C=O)OCH₃. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is planar. It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane containing all the atoms) and a center of inversion. Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion are achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism. (Note: It does show geometric isomerism, as it is the *trans* isomer, and its *cis* counterpart is dimethyl maleate. But geometric isomerism is different from optical isomerism).\n\n    *   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Formulation**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n    1.  **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two structural isomers (called tautomers) that can be interconverted, most commonly by the migration of a proton (H+) and a shift in a double bond. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, where a molecule containing a carbonyl group (keto form) is in equilibrium with its enol form (a molecule containing a hydroxyl group bonded to a carbon that is part of a C=C double bond).\n\n    2.  A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an **alpha-hydrogen**. This is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group. This alpha-carbon must typically be sp³ hybridized.\n\n    3.  Let's examine **benzoquinone** (specifically p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone).\n        *   Structure: It's a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at opposite positions (1 and 4) and two C=C double bonds.\n        *   Alpha-carbons: The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n        *   Alpha-hydrogens: Each of these alpha-carbons is part of a C=C double bond (they are sp² hybridized) and is bonded to one hydrogen atom. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ hybridized carbon, benzoquinone cannot undergo the typical keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    4.  Now let's examine **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.\n        *   Structure: It's a six-membered saturated ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH₂- groups.\n        *   Alpha-carbons: The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha to two carbonyl groups.\n        *   Alpha-hydrogens: Each of these alpha-carbons is sp³ hybridized and has two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are highly acidic because the negative charge of the resulting carbanion (enolate) can be delocalized over two carbonyl groups.\n        *   This compound readily undergoes tautomerism. In fact, it exists almost exclusively in its aromatic enol form, **phloroglucinol** (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is much more stable.\n        *   Keto form (Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) ⇌ Enol form (Phloroglucinol)\n        *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n    5.  **Conclusion for A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n    1.  **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable on the original molecule. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a **chiral center** (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    2.  Let's examine **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n        *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n        *   Let's analyze the carbon at position 2 (the one with the -OH group).

A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n    3.  Now let's examine **dimethyl fumarate**.\n        *   Structure: It is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n        *   The molecule is planar. It has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n        *   Alternatively, there are no chiral centers in the molecule (no carbon is bonded to four different groups).\n        *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **Conclusion for B**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Formulation**\n    *   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This matches the pair: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify two compounds from given pairs based on their isomeric properties.\n    *   **Part A:** Identify the compound between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione that does *not* show tautomerism.\n    *   **Part B:** Identify the compound between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate that *will* show optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   **Definition of Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers (tautomers) can readily interconvert.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an **alpha-hydrogen**—a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    2.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone)**: The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms alpha (adjacent) to the carbonyl groups are the carbons involved in the C=C double bonds. These carbons have no hydrogen atoms attached to them. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    3.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons is a CH₂ group, possessing two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows this compound to undergo tautomerism to form its enol isomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and highly stable, so the equilibrium strongly favors it.\n    4.  **Conclusion for A**: The compound that **does not** show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        *   -H (hydrogen)\n        *   -OH (hydroxyl)\n        *   -CH₃ (methyl)\n        *   -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and thus exhibits optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n    3.  **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, and it is the *trans* isomer. The molecule is planar. It possesses a center of symmetry (midpoint of the C=C bond) and a plane of symmetry (the plane containing the entire molecule). Molecules with a plane or center of symmetry are achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n    4.  **Conclusion for B**: The compound that **will show** optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one alpha-hydrogen. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to an alpha-carbon, which is the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring containing two ketone groups at opposite positions (positions 1 and 4) and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   Let's identify the alpha-carbons. The carbons adjacent to the C=O at position 1 are C2 and C6. The carbons adjacent to the C=O at position 4 are C3 and C5.\n    *   In the benzoquinone ring, all these alpha-carbons (C2, C3, C5, C6) are part of a C=C double bond. They are sp²-hybridized and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them.\n    *   Since benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   Let's identify the alpha-carbons. For each carbonyl group, the adjacent carbons are alpha-carbons. For example, for the C=O at position 1, the alpha-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 each have two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   Because it possesses alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it tautomerizes to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound and thus highly stable.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part 1:** Benzoquinone does not have alpha-hydrogens and thus does not show tautomerism. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does.\n    *   Therefore, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying Compound B (Shows optical isomerism)**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the -OH group.\n    *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since all four attached groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are in a *trans* position relative to the C=C double bond.\n    *   To check for chirality, we look for chiral centers or overall molecular asymmetry.\n    *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The carbons of the double bond are sp²-hybridized.\n    *   The molecule possesses a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   Since dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part 2:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and is optically active. Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and not optically active.\n    *   Therefore, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Combination**\n\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Part A)**\n\n    1.  **Definition of Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers.

They do have hydrogen atoms, but these are vinylic hydrogens, not the typical alpha-hydrogens on an sp3 carbon required for keto-enol tautomerism.\n        *   Attempting to form an enol would disrupt the conjugated system of the ring, leading to a very unstable structure. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n\n    3.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   Structure: A saturated six-membered ring (all sp3 carbons except for the carbonyl carbons) with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n        *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons to two carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons has two hydrogen atoms (alpha-hydrogens).\n        *   The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the molecule to easily undergo tautomerism to form its enol tautomer, which is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol).

The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This carbon must be sp3 hybridized.\n\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups opposite each other (at positions 1 and 4) and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These alpha-carbons are sp2 hybridized (they are part of the ring's double bonds). They do not have the required sp3 hybridization for typical keto-enol tautomerism.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) that can migrate to the carbonyl oxygen.\n\n1.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The hydrogen atoms on carbons 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-hydrogens because these carbons are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. In fact, they are alpha to two carbonyl groups, making them particularly acidic and easy to remove.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. By losing protons from the alpha-carbons and rearranging the double bonds, it converts into its enol form, which is **1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol)**.\n    *   **Keto form:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (C₆H₆O₃)\n    *   **Enol form:** 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (C₆H₆O₃)\n    *   **Stability:** The enol form (phloroglucinol) is an **aromatic** compound. The stability gained from forming an aromatic ring is a powerful driving force, so this compound exists almost entirely in its enol form.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups at opposite (para) positions. Its chemical name is cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons alpha (adjacent) to the carbonyl groups are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds within the ring. While these carbons do have hydrogen atoms, a key distinction must be made.\n    *   **Tautomerization vs. Redox:** Tautomers must have the same molecular formula. The molecular formula for benzoquinone is C₆H₄O₂. If it were to undergo a process to form its corresponding aromatic alcohol, it would become hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene). The formula for hydroquinone is C₆H₆O₂. Since the molecular formulas are different (C₆H₄O₂ vs. C₆H₆O₂), the conversion between benzoquinone and hydroquinone is not tautomerism; it is a **redox reaction** (reduction/oxidation). Benzoquinone does not have a stable tautomeric form with the same molecular formula.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n**Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is benzoquinone.**\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\nA compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n\n1.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine carbon-2 (the carbon bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Chirality:** Since carbon-2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and **will show** optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is trans-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The double-bonded carbons are only bonded to three groups each.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (an inversion point at the center of the C=C bond). The presence of a center of symmetry or a plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and **will not show** optical isomerism.\n\n**Therefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.**\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **A** (does not show tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   **B** (will show optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\n*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Part A)**\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers.

The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) on an sp³ hybridized carbon. The proton migrates from the alpha-carbon to the carbonyl oxygen, and a double bond shifts.\n\n    2.  **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):** The structure is a cyclic conjugated diketone. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are part of the ring's double bonds, meaning they are sp² hybridized. It lacks alpha-hydrogens on sp³ hybridized carbons, which is the standard requirement for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism under normal conditions.\n\n    3.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp³ hybridized, and each carries two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens located between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, making them particularly acidic and mobile. The compound readily tautomerizes to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and thus exceptionally stable, so the equilibrium heavily favors the enol form. Since it can interconvert between keto and enol forms, it shows tautomerism.\n\n    4.  **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Part B)**\n\n    1.  **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules.

The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral. It will exist as a pair of enantiomers (optical isomers).\n\n    3.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is a planar molecule (around the C=C double bond). It possesses a plane of symmetry and is achiral. It does not have any chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups). Therefore, it cannot exhibit optical isomerism. (It does exhibit geometric isomerism, with its cis-isomer being dimethyl maleate).\n\n    4.  **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer**\n\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\n*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where isomers, called tautomers, can readily interconvert.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen, and the carbon is the alpha-carbon.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups on carbons 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH2- groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The hydrogen atoms on carbons 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-hydrogens because they are attached to carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. In fact, these alpha-hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerization. It can lose protons and rearrange its double bonds to form its enol tautomer, which is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (also known as phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and therefore exceptionally stable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show extensive tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It's a six-membered ring containing two C=C double bonds and two C=O groups opposite each other (at positions 1 and 4).\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons do not have any hydrogen atoms attached that fit the typical requirement for keto-enol tautomerism (i.e., hydrogens on an sp³ hybridized alpha-carbon).\n    *   **Tautomerization:** The conversion of benzoquinone to its corresponding 'enol', hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene), is a reduction reaction (it requires the addition of two electrons and two protons), not a simple tautomeric equilibrium. Therefore, benzoquinone is not considered to exhibit tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does *not* show tautomerism.\n\n**Therefore, compound (A) is benzoquinone.**\n\n---\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (also known as methyl lactate):**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon bonded to the -OH group).\n        *   Group 1: -H (hydrogen)\n        *   Group 2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n        *   Group 3: -CH₃ (methyl)\n        *   Group 4: -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and will exhibit optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers, R and S).\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the trans isomer of an alkene with methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃) on each side of the double bond.\n        H₃COOC     H\n               \\   /\n                C=C\n               /   \\\n              H     COOCH₃\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar.

A molecule with a center of inversion is always achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does *not* show optical isomerism.\n\n**Therefore, compound (B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.**\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\n*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A):**\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where isomers, known as tautomers, can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl C=O group).\n    *   Let's examine **benzoquinone** (specifically p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone). The structure consists of a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O groups at opposite positions (1 and 4). The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   Now, let's examine **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**. This molecule is a cyclic ketone with carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons has two hydrogen atoms. These alpha-hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. This allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its enol form, which is **phloroglucinol** (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This enol form is aromatic and therefore exceptionally stable, meaning the equilibrium lies far towards the enol side. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows extensive tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B):**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs when a molecule is **chiral**, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reason for chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center.

This is the *trans* isomer of an alkene with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar around the double bond and possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry). Molecules with a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry are achiral and thus do not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers, called tautomers, can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This carbon is called the alpha-carbon (α-carbon), and the hydrogen is an alpha-hydrogen (α-hydrogen). The α-carbon must be sp³ hybridized.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered carbon ring with ketone groups (C=O) at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the α-carbons. They are sp³ hybridized and each has two α-hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since it has sp³ α-carbons with α-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it readily tautomerizes to its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is highly stable due to aromaticity. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (specifically, 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds between positions 2-3 and 5-6.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the ketone groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6. These α-carbons are part of the C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp² hybridized.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not have any α-hydrogens on an sp³ hybridized carbon. The requirement for standard keto-enol tautomerism is not met. Therefore, benzoquinone does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, will show optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (or chiral center), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2, the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the central carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral. Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate *will* show optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a *trans* configuration around the double bond:\n        ```\n          H      COOCH₃\n           \\    /\n            C==C\n           /    \\\n      CH₃OOC     H\n        ```\n    *   **Chirality:**\n        *   The molecule has no chiral centers (no carbon is attached to four different groups).\n        *   The molecule is largely planar and possesses a center of symmetry (an inversion center) located at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the center of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and its mirror image is superimposable on itself.

These carbons are part of the C=C double bonds. They are sp² hybridized.\n        *   While these alpha-carbons do have hydrogen atoms attached, these are vinylic hydrogens. The typical mechanism for keto-enol tautomerism involves the removal of a proton from an sp³ hybridized alpha-carbon.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon).

Each of these α-carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Tautomerism:** Since it possesses α-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. It tautomerizes to form 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and highly stable enol form.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an α-hydrogen (alpha-hydrogen).\n\n2.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone:**\n    *   **Structure:** Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone) is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups opposite each other and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** Let's look at the carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the two carbonyl groups. These alpha carbons are also part of the carbon-carbon double bonds.

Therefore, it does not show tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has multiple α-hydrogens, it can readily undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it exists in equilibrium with its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is aromatic and thus highly stable.\n\n4.  **Decision for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism (B)**\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in molecules that are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reason for chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a central carbon atom (at position 2) bonded to the following four groups:\n        1.

The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the α-carbons) are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds. These carbons are sp²-hybridized and do not have the required α-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This is a saturated six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are α-carbons. Each of these carbons is sp³-hybridized and is bonded to two hydrogen atoms (α-hydrogens). The presence of these α-hydrogens allows it to undergo tautomerism to form its enol, which is phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).

Isomers, including tautomers, must have the same molecular formula. The conversion of benzoquinone to hydroquinone is a reduction, not a tautomerization.

A very common form is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it typically needs a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen on an sp³-hybridized carbon). The tautomers must have the same molecular formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH₂- groups.\n    *   **α-Hydrogens:** Each -CH₂- group is positioned between two carbonyl groups, making the hydrogens on these carbons (α-hydrogens) particularly acidic and available for tautomerism.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize to form its enol isomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (also known as phloroglucinol).\n        *   Keto form: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (C₆H₆O₃)\n        *   Enol form: Phloroglucinol (C₆H₆O₃)\n    *   **Stability:** The enol form, phloroglucinol, is an aromatic compound, which makes it exceptionally stable.

They do have hydrogens, but these carbons are sp²-hybridized. Standard keto-enol tautomerism involves abstraction of a proton from an sp³-hybridized alpha-carbon.\n    *   **Tautomerization Check:** If benzoquinone were to tautomerize, it would form 1,4-dihydroxybenzene (hydroquinone). Let's check their molecular formulas:\n        *   Benzoquinone: C₆H₄O₂\n        *   Hydroquinone: C₆H₆O₂\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecular formulas are different. The conversion from benzoquinone to hydroquinone requires the addition of two hydrogen atoms, which is a reduction reaction, not an isomerization (tautomerism).

Its molecular formula is C6H4O2. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp2-hybridized. Keto-enol tautomerism typically involves the removal of a proton from an sp3-hybridized alpha-carbon. While protons can be removed from sp2-carbons, in the case of benzoquinone, this would lead to a highly unstable intermediate. More importantly, for benzoquinone to form an aromatic \"enol\" (which would be hydroquinone), it would need to gain two hydrogen atoms, changing its molecular formula to C6H6O2. Since tautomers must have the same molecular formula, the conversion of benzoquinone to hydroquinone is a reduction reaction, not tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    3.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** The structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups.

The hydrogens on these carbons (α-hydrogens) are highly acidic and are readily removed. The compound can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. The resulting enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which has the same molecular formula (C6H6O3). This enol form is aromatic, making it exceptionally stable.

This process typically requires a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the alpha-carbon), and this carbon must be sp3 hybridized.\n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):**\n        *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds and two carbonyl groups at opposite positions (1 and 4).\n        *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n        *   These alpha-carbons are part of a C=C double bond, meaning they are sp2 hybridized.\n        *   Because there are no alpha-hydrogens on an sp3 hybridized carbon, standard keto-enol tautomerism is not possible. To form an enol (a phenol-type structure), a chemical reaction (reduction) would be required, which is different from tautomerism (an equilibrium between isomers).\n        *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   Its structure is a six-membered saturated ring (all single bonds between carbons) with three carbonyl groups (C=O) at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n        *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the alpha-carbons.\n        *   Each of these alpha-carbons is a CH2 group, so they are sp3 hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows for keto-enol tautomerism. The molecule can lose protons from these alpha-carbons to form enols.\n        *   In fact, this compound exists almost exclusively in its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n        *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    The question asks to identify which compound between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate will show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n        *   Let's analyze the carbon at position 2 (the one with the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n        *   The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus capable of showing optical isomerism (it exists as two enantiomers).\n        *   Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are *trans* to each other across the C=C double bond.\n        *   Let's check for chirality.\n        *   The molecule has no chiral centers (no carbon is attached to four different groups).\n        *   The molecule has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. It also has a plane of symmetry if we consider the molecule to be planar.\n        *   Since the molecule is achiral, it is not optically active.\n        *   Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n3.  **Final Combination:**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\n*   **Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two or more interconvertible constitutional isomers, usually involving the migration of a proton. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one **alpha-hydrogen**. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to an alpha-carbon, which is the carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This alpha-carbon must be sp³ hybridized.\n\n    *   Let's analyze the given compounds:\n        1.  **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone)**: Its structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl groups opposite each other. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of C=C double bonds. They are sp² hybridized and do not have the characteristics required for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n        2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: Its structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbon atoms between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons. Each of these alpha-carbons is sp³ hybridized and is bonded to two hydrogen atoms (-CH₂-). The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it tautomerizes to form the highly stable aromatic compound phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Thus, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism (B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in molecules that are **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group).\n            *   It is bonded to four different groups:\n                1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n                2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n                3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n                4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n            *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is chiral and therefore **will show optical isomerism** (it has two enantiomers, R and S).\n\n        2.  **Dimethyl fumarate**: This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n            *   The molecule has a center of inversion symmetry in the middle of the C=C double bond.\n            *   It has no chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups).\n            *   Molecules with a center of inversion are achiral. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B**: The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Determination**:\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\n**Thinking Process:**\n\nThe user wants me to identify two compounds from a given set based on their chemical properties. I need to solve two sub-problems.\n\n**Part A: Identify the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\nThe compounds to consider are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n\n1.  **Analyze Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structures (tautomers) are in equilibrium and are readily interconvertible. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism. A necessary condition for a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one hydrogen atom on the alpha-carbon (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Analyze Benzoquinone:** Let's assume the user is referring to the most common isomer, 1,4-benzoquinone.\n    *   The chemical formula is C₆H₄O₂.\n    *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with alternating single and double bonds, and two ketone (C=O) groups at opposite positions (1 and 4).\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are C-2, C-3, C-5, and C-6.\n    *   Let's examine these alpha-carbons. They are all part of carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) within the ring. Each of these carbons is bonded to another carbon via a double bond and a single bond, leaving only one bond for a hydrogen. In the structure of 1,4-benzoquinone, these carbons are bonded to hydrogen atoms. Wait, let me re-check the structure of 1,4-benzoquinone. The formula is C6H4O2. The structure is a cycle: O=C(1)-CH=CH-C(4)(=O)-CH=CH- (closing the ring between C(1) and the last CH).\n    *   Let's check the alpha positions again. The carbons alpha to the C1=O are C2 and C6. The carbons alpha to the C4=O are C3 and C5. Are these carbons bonded to hydrogen? Yes, the carbons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 are sp2 hybridized and each is bonded to one hydrogen atom.\n    *   However, for keto-enol tautomerism, the alpha-carbon is typically sp3 hybridized. Deprotonation of an sp2 carbon is much more difficult than an sp3 carbon. More importantly, tautomerism involves the formation of an enol (a C=C-OH group). If we try to form an enol from benzoquinone, we would have to break the existing conjugated system. The key point here is the absence of an *sp3 hybridized alpha-carbon with a hydrogen*. Keto-enol tautomerism, in its standard form, does not occur. To form the aromatic hydroquinone tautomer would require a reduction (addition of 2H), not just an intramolecular proton shift. Therefore, 1,4-benzoquinone is considered not to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The chemical formula is C₆H₆O₃.\n    *   Its structure is a saturated six-membered ring (cyclohexane) with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the alpha-carbons, situated between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   Each of these alpha-carbons is a CH₂ group, meaning they each have two alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   These alpha-hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can easily lose an alpha-hydrogen to form an enolate, which can then be protonated on the oxygen to form an enol.\n    *   In fact, it can tautomerize to form 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound. The stability gained from aromaticity makes this tautomerization highly favorable.\n    *   So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione definitely shows tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does. The compound labeled (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identify the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\nThe compounds to consider are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n\n1.  **Analyze Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   This is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's focus on the central carbon atom, C-2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   Let's identify the four groups attached to this carbon:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   All four of these groups are different.\n    *   Therefore, C-2 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule does not have an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Analyze dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid.\n    *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   Let's look for chiral centers. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The two central carbons are sp2 hybridized and part of a double bond.\n    *   Let's check for overall molecular chirality. The molecule is relatively planar. It has a center of inversion (also called a center of symmetry) located at the midpoint of the C=C bond. Any molecule that possesses a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate will not. The compound labeled (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching these conclusions with the options:\n*   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (Incorrect), B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Correct)\n*   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (Incorrect), B = dimethyl fumarate (Incorrect)\n*   C) A = benzoquinone (Correct), B = dimethyl fumarate (Incorrect)\n*   D) A = benzoquinone (Correct), B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Correct)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\n*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers can interconvert by a chemical reaction called tautomerization. A common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Its structure is `(-C(=O)-CH2-)` repeated three times in a ring. Each methylene group (`-CH2-`) is located between two carbonyl groups (`C=O`). The hydrogen atoms on these methylene groups are α-hydrogens. They are particularly acidic and can easily move to an adjacent oxygen atom, forming an enol. In fact, this compound exists predominantly in its tautomeric form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is stabilized by aromaticity. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):** This molecule consists of a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O groups. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them. Since there are no α-hydrogens, keto-enol tautomerism cannot occur.

    "This is a two-part question requiring the analysis of tautomerism and optical isomerism for specific compounds. The reasoning across all provided candidate answers is highly consistent, even if their final letter choices vary.\n\n### **Detailed Reasoning**\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Definition of Tautomerism:** The most common type of tautomerism is keto-enol tautomerism.

These carbons are sp²-hybridized and do not have the required α-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom—a hydrogen atom on an sp3-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n    1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone, C₆H₄O₂):**\n        *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl groups at opposite positions.\n        *   The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds within the ring.\n        *   These alpha-carbons are sp2-hybridized, not sp3-hybridized.\n        *   Since there are no alpha-hydrogens on sp3-hybridized carbons, benzoquinone cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (C₆H₆O₃):**\n        *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons between the carbonyls (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups.\n        *   These carbons (C2, C4, C6) are sp3-hybridized and are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons has two alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   Due to the presence of these alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can and does exhibit keto-enol tautomerism. It readily converts to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and highly stable compound.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism. Therefore, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Part B)**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Methyl lactate):**\n        *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        *   This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since the carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and thus exhibits optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n    2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is the *trans* isomer, meaning the two methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃) groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n        *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there are no chiral centers.\n        *   The molecule possesses a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the C=C bond), which makes it achiral.\n        *   Since the molecule is achiral, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism. Therefore, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer:**\n    *   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is an equilibrium between two constitutional isomers, most commonly keto-enol tautomers. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This alpha-hydrogen must be on an sp3 hybridized carbon for the process to occur readily.\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   Structure: It is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 4, and double bonds between carbons 2-3 and 5-6.\n    *   The alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyls) are C2, C6, C3, and C5.\n    *   All these alpha-carbons are sp2 hybridized because they are part of the ring's double bonds.\n    *   While they do have hydrogen atoms attached, removing one of these protons is difficult, and the process would disrupt the stable conjugated system of the molecule. Standard keto-enol tautomerism involves an alpha-hydrogen on an sp3 carbon. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   Structure: It is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp3 hybridized.\n    *   The alpha-carbons are C2, C4, and C6. Each of these carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   These hydrogens are acidic because they are located between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   The presence of these sp3 alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerization to form its enol, which is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and therefore very stable.\n    *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n    *   Let's analyze the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the -OH group.\n    *   This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since it is bonded to four different groups, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n    *   Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   Structure: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is the trans isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate.\n    *   The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond, and the structure is planar.\n    *   It does not contain any chiral centers (no carbon is bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making it achiral.\n    *   Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where molecules can interconvert by the migration of an atom (usually hydrogen) and a shift in the location of a double bond. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one **alpha-hydrogen**, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (the alpha-carbon). This alpha-carbon must be sp³ hybridized.\n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** Its structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4) and two C=C double bonds. The molecular formula is C₆H₄O₂. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized, not sp³. They do not have the type of alpha-hydrogens required for standard keto-enol tautomerism. Converting it to its corresponding \"enol\" form (hydroquinone, C₆H₆(OH)₂) would require adding two hydrogen atoms, changing the molecular formula from C₆H₄O₂ to C₆H₆O₂. Since tautomers must have the same molecular formula, this is a redox reaction, not tautomerism. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Its structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The molecular formula is C₆H₆O₃. The carbons between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are sp³ hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms (-CH₂-). These are alpha-hydrogens. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because the negative charge on the resulting carbanion (enolate) is stabilized by two adjacent carbonyl groups. This compound readily undergoes tautomerism to form its enol, **phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene)**, which has the same molecular formula (C₆H₆O₃). The enol form is aromatic and thus exceptionally stable. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore **will show optical isomerism** (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond. The molecule has a center of symmetry and is planar, meaning it is superimposable on its mirror image. It contains no chiral centers. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer**\n\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n    This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where isomers can interconvert through a chemical reaction, most commonly the migration of a proton. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon). This hydrogen is called an α-hydrogen.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Let's examine its structure. It is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are α-carbons to two carbonyl groups each. Each of these α-carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms (α-hydrogens). The presence of these acidic α-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo tautomerization to form its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and therefore very stable, meaning cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily exhibits tautomerism.\n         \n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** Let's examine its structure. It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4). The α-carbons (positions 2, 3, 5, and 6) are part of carbon-carbon double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). They do not have the typical structure of an α-carbon (sp³ hybridized) from which a proton can be easily removed to form an enol. Therefore, benzoquinone does not have α-hydrogens in the conventional sense required for keto-enol tautomerism. It cannot tautomerize.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules.

Let's analyze the carbon atom at position 2 (the one with the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-C(=O)OCH₃)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and thus exhibits optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OC(=O)CH=CH(C=O)OCH₃. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is planar. It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane containing all the atoms) and a center of inversion. Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion are achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism. (Note: It does show geometric isomerism, as it is the *trans* isomer, and its *cis* counterpart is dimethyl maleate. But geometric isomerism is different from optical isomerism).\n\n    *   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Formulation**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n    1.  **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two structural isomers (called tautomers) that can be interconverted, most commonly by the migration of a proton (H+) and a shift in a double bond. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, where a molecule containing a carbonyl group (keto form) is in equilibrium with its enol form (a molecule containing a hydroxyl group bonded to a carbon that is part of a C=C double bond).\n\n    2.  A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an **alpha-hydrogen**. This is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group. This alpha-carbon must typically be sp³ hybridized.\n\n    3.

The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one alpha-hydrogen. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to an alpha-carbon, which is the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring containing two ketone groups at opposite positions (positions 1 and 4) and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   Let's identify the alpha-carbons. The carbons adjacent to the C=O at position 1 are C2 and C6. The carbons adjacent to the C=O at position 4 are C3 and C5.\n    *   In the benzoquinone ring, all these alpha-carbons (C2, C3, C5, C6) are part of a C=C double bond. They are sp²-hybridized and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them.\n    *   Since benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   Let's identify the alpha-carbons. For each carbonyl group, the adjacent carbons are alpha-carbons. For example, for the C=O at position 1, the alpha-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 each have two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   Because it possesses alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it tautomerizes to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound and thus highly stable.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part 1:** Benzoquinone does not have alpha-hydrogens and thus does not show tautomerism. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does.\n    *   Therefore, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying Compound B (Shows optical isomerism)**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the -OH group.\n    *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since all four attached groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are in a *trans* position relative to the C=C double bond.\n    *   To check for chirality, we look for chiral centers or overall molecular asymmetry.\n    *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The carbons of the double bond are sp²-hybridized.\n    *   The molecule possesses a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   Since dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part 2:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and is optically active.

The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This carbon must be sp3 hybridized.\n\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups opposite each other (at positions 1 and 4) and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These alpha-carbons are sp2 hybridized (they are part of the ring's double bonds). They do not have the required sp3 hybridization for typical keto-enol tautomerism.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) that can migrate to the carbonyl oxygen.\n\n1.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The hydrogen atoms on carbons 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-hydrogens because these carbons are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. In fact, they are alpha to two carbonyl groups, making them particularly acidic and easy to remove.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. By losing protons from the alpha-carbons and rearranging the double bonds, it converts into its enol form, which is **1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol)**.\n    *   **Keto form:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (C₆H₆O₃)\n    *   **Enol form:** 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (C₆H₆O₃)\n    *   **Stability:** The enol form (phloroglucinol) is an **aromatic** compound. The stability gained from forming an aromatic ring is a powerful driving force, so this compound exists almost entirely in its enol form.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups at opposite (para) positions. Its chemical name is cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons alpha (adjacent) to the carbonyl groups are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds within the ring. While these carbons do have hydrogen atoms, a key distinction must be made.\n    *   **Tautomerization vs. Redox:** Tautomers must have the same molecular formula. The molecular formula for benzoquinone is C₆H₄O₂. If it were to undergo a process to form its corresponding aromatic alcohol, it would become hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene). The formula for hydroquinone is C₆H₆O₂. Since the molecular formulas are different (C₆H₄O₂ vs. C₆H₆O₂), the conversion between benzoquinone and hydroquinone is not tautomerism; it is a **redox reaction** (reduction/oxidation). Benzoquinone does not have a stable tautomeric form with the same molecular formula.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n**Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is benzoquinone.**\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\nA compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n\n1.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine carbon-2 (the carbon bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Chirality:** Since carbon-2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and **will show** optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is trans-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The double-bonded carbons are only bonded to three groups each.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (an inversion point at the center of the C=C bond). The presence of a center of symmetry or a plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and **will not show** optical isomerism.\n\n**Therefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.**\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **A** (does not show tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   **B** (will show optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\n*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Part A)**\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers.

The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) on an sp³ hybridized carbon. The proton migrates from the alpha-carbon to the carbonyl oxygen, and a double bond shifts.\n\n    2.  **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):** The structure is a cyclic conjugated diketone. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are part of the ring's double bonds, meaning they are sp² hybridized. It lacks alpha-hydrogens on sp³ hybridized carbons, which is the standard requirement for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism under normal conditions.\n\n    3.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp³ hybridized, and each carries two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens located between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, making them particularly acidic and mobile. The compound readily tautomerizes to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and thus exceptionally stable, so the equilibrium heavily favors the enol form. Since it can interconvert between keto and enol forms, it shows tautomerism.\n\n    4.  **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Part B)**\n\n    1.  **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules.

The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral. It will exist as a pair of enantiomers (optical isomers).\n\n    3.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is a planar molecule (around the C=C double bond). It possesses a plane of symmetry and is achiral. It does not have any chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups). Therefore, it cannot exhibit optical isomerism. (It does exhibit geometric isomerism, with its cis-isomer being dimethyl maleate).\n\n    4.  **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer**\n\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\n*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where isomers, called tautomers, can readily interconvert.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen, and the carbon is the alpha-carbon.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups on carbons 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH2- groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The hydrogen atoms on carbons 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-hydrogens because they are attached to carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. In fact, these alpha-hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerization. It can lose protons and rearrange its double bonds to form its enol tautomer, which is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (also known as phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and therefore exceptionally stable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show extensive tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It's a six-membered ring containing two C=C double bonds and two C=O groups opposite each other (at positions 1 and 4).\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons do not have any hydrogen atoms attached that fit the typical requirement for keto-enol tautomerism (i.e., hydrogens on an sp³ hybridized alpha-carbon).\n    *   **Tautomerization:** The conversion of benzoquinone to its corresponding 'enol', hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene), is a reduction reaction (it requires the addition of two electrons and two protons), not a simple tautomeric equilibrium. Therefore, benzoquinone is not considered to exhibit tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does *not* show tautomerism.\n\n**Therefore, compound (A) is benzoquinone.**\n\n---\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (also known as methyl lactate):**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon bonded to the -OH group).\n        *   Group 1: -H (hydrogen)\n        *   Group 2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n        *   Group 3: -CH₃ (methyl)\n        *   Group 4: -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and will exhibit optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers, R and S).\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the trans isomer of an alkene with methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃) on each side of the double bond.\n        H₃COOC     H\n               \\   /\n                C=C\n               /   \\\n              H     COOCH₃\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar.

A molecule with a center of inversion is always achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does *not* show optical isomerism.\n\n**Therefore, compound (B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.**\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\n*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A):**\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where isomers, known as tautomers, can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl C=O group).\n    *   Let's examine **benzoquinone** (specifically p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone). The structure consists of a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O groups at opposite positions (1 and 4). The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   Now, let's examine **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**. This molecule is a cyclic ketone with carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons has two hydrogen atoms. These alpha-hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. This allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its enol form, which is **phloroglucinol** (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This enol form is aromatic and therefore exceptionally stable, meaning the equilibrium lies far towards the enol side. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows extensive tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B):**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs when a molecule is **chiral**, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reason for chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center.

This is the *trans* isomer of an alkene with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar around the double bond and possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry). Molecules with a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry are achiral and thus do not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers, called tautomers, can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This carbon is called the alpha-carbon (α-carbon), and the hydrogen is an alpha-hydrogen (α-hydrogen). The α-carbon must be sp³ hybridized.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered carbon ring with ketone groups (C=O) at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the α-carbons. They are sp³ hybridized and each has two α-hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since it has sp³ α-carbons with α-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it readily tautomerizes to its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is highly stable due to aromaticity. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (specifically, 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds between positions 2-3 and 5-6.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the ketone groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6. These α-carbons are part of the C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp² hybridized.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not have any α-hydrogens on an sp³ hybridized carbon. The requirement for standard keto-enol tautomerism is not met. Therefore, benzoquinone does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, will show optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (or chiral center), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2, the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the central carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral. Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate *will* show optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a *trans* configuration around the double bond:\n        ```\n          H      COOCH₃\n           \\    /\n            C==C\n           /    \\\n      CH₃OOC     H\n        ```\n    *   **Chirality:**\n        *   The molecule has no chiral centers (no carbon is attached to four different groups).\n        *   The molecule is largely planar and possesses a center of symmetry (an inversion center) located at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the center of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and its mirror image is superimposable on itself.

These carbons are part of the C=C double bonds. They are sp² hybridized.\n        *   While these alpha-carbons do have hydrogen atoms attached, these are vinylic hydrogens. The typical mechanism for keto-enol tautomerism involves the removal of a proton from an sp³ hybridized alpha-carbon.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon).

Each of these α-carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Tautomerism:** Since it possesses α-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. It tautomerizes to form 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and highly stable enol form.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an α-hydrogen (alpha-hydrogen).\n\n2.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone:**\n    *   **Structure:** Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone) is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups opposite each other and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** Let's look at the carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the two carbonyl groups. These alpha carbons are also part of the carbon-carbon double bonds.

Therefore, it does not show tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has multiple α-hydrogens, it can readily undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it exists in equilibrium with its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is aromatic and thus highly stable.\n\n4.  **Decision for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism (B)**\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in molecules that are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reason for chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a central carbon atom (at position 2) bonded to the following four groups:\n        1.

The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the α-carbons) are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds. These carbons are sp²-hybridized and do not have the required α-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This is a saturated six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are α-carbons. Each of these carbons is sp³-hybridized and is bonded to two hydrogen atoms (α-hydrogens). The presence of these α-hydrogens allows it to undergo tautomerism to form its enol, which is phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).

Isomers, including tautomers, must have the same molecular formula. The conversion of benzoquinone to hydroquinone is a reduction, not a tautomerization.

A very common form is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it typically needs a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen on an sp³-hybridized carbon). The tautomers must have the same molecular formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH₂- groups.\n    *   **α-Hydrogens:** Each -CH₂- group is positioned between two carbonyl groups, making the hydrogens on these carbons (α-hydrogens) particularly acidic and available for tautomerism.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize to form its enol isomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (also known as phloroglucinol).\n        *   Keto form: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (C₆H₆O₃)\n        *   Enol form: Phloroglucinol (C₆H₆O₃)\n    *   **Stability:** The enol form, phloroglucinol, is an aromatic compound, which makes it exceptionally stable.

They do have hydrogens, but these carbons are sp²-hybridized. Standard keto-enol tautomerism involves abstraction of a proton from an sp³-hybridized alpha-carbon.\n    *   **Tautomerization Check:** If benzoquinone were to tautomerize, it would form 1,4-dihydroxybenzene (hydroquinone). Let's check their molecular formulas:\n        *   Benzoquinone: C₆H₄O₂\n        *   Hydroquinone: C₆H₆O₂\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecular formulas are different. The conversion from benzoquinone to hydroquinone requires the addition of two hydrogen atoms, which is a reduction reaction, not an isomerization (tautomerism).

Its molecular formula is C6H4O2. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp2-hybridized. Keto-enol tautomerism typically involves the removal of a proton from an sp3-hybridized alpha-carbon. While protons can be removed from sp2-carbons, in the case of benzoquinone, this would lead to a highly unstable intermediate. More importantly, for benzoquinone to form an aromatic \"enol\" (which would be hydroquinone), it would need to gain two hydrogen atoms, changing its molecular formula to C6H6O2. Since tautomers must have the same molecular formula, the conversion of benzoquinone to hydroquinone is a reduction reaction, not tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    3.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** The structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups.

The hydrogens on these carbons (α-hydrogens) are highly acidic and are readily removed. The compound can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. The resulting enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which has the same molecular formula (C6H6O3). This enol form is aromatic, making it exceptionally stable.

This process typically requires a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the alpha-carbon), and this carbon must be sp3 hybridized.\n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):**\n        *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds and two carbonyl groups at opposite positions (1 and 4).\n        *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n        *   These alpha-carbons are part of a C=C double bond, meaning they are sp2 hybridized.\n        *   Because there are no alpha-hydrogens on an sp3 hybridized carbon, standard keto-enol tautomerism is not possible. To form an enol (a phenol-type structure), a chemical reaction (reduction) would be required, which is different from tautomerism (an equilibrium between isomers).\n        *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   Its structure is a six-membered saturated ring (all single bonds between carbons) with three carbonyl groups (C=O) at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n        *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the alpha-carbons.\n        *   Each of these alpha-carbons is a CH2 group, so they are sp3 hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows for keto-enol tautomerism. The molecule can lose protons from these alpha-carbons to form enols.\n        *   In fact, this compound exists almost exclusively in its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n        *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    The question asks to identify which compound between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate will show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n        *   Let's analyze the carbon at position 2 (the one with the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n        *   The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus capable of showing optical isomerism (it exists as two enantiomers).\n        *   Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are *trans* to each other across the C=C double bond.\n        *   Let's check for chirality.\n        *   The molecule has no chiral centers (no carbon is attached to four different groups).\n        *   The molecule has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. It also has a plane of symmetry if we consider the molecule to be planar.\n        *   Since the molecule is achiral, it is not optically active.\n        *   Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n3.  **Final Combination:**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\n*   **Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two or more interconvertible constitutional isomers, usually involving the migration of a proton. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one **alpha-hydrogen**. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to an alpha-carbon, which is the carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This alpha-carbon must be sp³ hybridized.\n\n    *   Let's analyze the given compounds:\n        1.  **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone)**: Its structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl groups opposite each other. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of C=C double bonds. They are sp² hybridized and do not have the characteristics required for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n        2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: Its structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbon atoms between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons. Each of these alpha-carbons is sp³ hybridized and is bonded to two hydrogen atoms (-CH₂-). The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it tautomerizes to form the highly stable aromatic compound phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Thus, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism (B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in molecules that are **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a **chiral center** (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    *   Let's analyze the given compounds:\n        1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Its structural formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group).\n            *   It is bonded to four different groups:\n                1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n                2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n                3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n                4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n            *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is chiral and therefore **will show optical isomerism** (it has two enantiomers, R and S).\n\n        2.  **Dimethyl fumarate**: This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n            *   The molecule has a center of inversion symmetry in the middle of the C=C double bond.\n            *   It has no chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups).\n            *   Molecules with a center of inversion are achiral. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B**: The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Determination**:\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\n**Thinking Process:**\n\nThe user wants me to identify two compounds from a given set based on their chemical properties. I need to solve two sub-problems.\n\n**Part A: Identify the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\nThe compounds to consider are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n\n1.  **Analyze Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structures (tautomers) are in equilibrium and are readily interconvertible. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism. A necessary condition for a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one hydrogen atom on the alpha-carbon (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Analyze Benzoquinone:** Let's assume the user is referring to the most common isomer, 1,4-benzoquinone.\n    *   The chemical formula is C₆H₄O₂.\n    *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with alternating single and double bonds, and two ketone (C=O) groups at opposite positions (1 and 4).\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are C-2, C-3, C-5, and C-6.\n    *   Let's examine these alpha-carbons. They are all part of carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) within the ring. Each of these carbons is bonded to another carbon via a double bond and a single bond, leaving only one bond for a hydrogen. In the structure of 1,4-benzoquinone, these carbons are bonded to hydrogen atoms. Wait, let me re-check the structure of 1,4-benzoquinone. The formula is C6H4O2. The structure is a cycle: O=C(1)-CH=CH-C(4)(=O)-CH=CH- (closing the ring between C(1) and the last CH).\n    *   Let's check the alpha positions again. The carbons alpha to the C1=O are C2 and C6. The carbons alpha to the C4=O are C3 and C5. Are these carbons bonded to hydrogen? Yes, the carbons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 are sp2 hybridized and each is bonded to one hydrogen atom.\n    *   However, for keto-enol tautomerism, the alpha-carbon is typically sp3 hybridized. Deprotonation of an sp2 carbon is much more difficult than an sp3 carbon. More importantly, tautomerism involves the formation of an enol (a C=C-OH group). If we try to form an enol from benzoquinone, we would have to break the existing conjugated system. The key point here is the absence of an *sp3 hybridized alpha-carbon with a hydrogen*. Keto-enol tautomerism, in its standard form, does not occur. To form the aromatic hydroquinone tautomer would require a reduction (addition of 2H), not just an intramolecular proton shift. Therefore, 1,4-benzoquinone is considered not to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The chemical formula is C₆H₆O₃.\n    *   Its structure is a saturated six-membered ring (cyclohexane) with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the alpha-carbons, situated between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   Each of these alpha-carbons is a CH₂ group, meaning they each have two alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   These alpha-hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can easily lose an alpha-hydrogen to form an enolate, which can then be protonated on the oxygen to form an enol.\n    *   In fact, it can tautomerize to form 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound. The stability gained from aromaticity makes this tautomerization highly favorable.\n    *   So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione definitely shows tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does. The compound labeled (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identify the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\nThe compounds to consider are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n\n1.  **Analyze Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   This is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's focus on the central carbon atom, C-2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   Let's identify the four groups attached to this carbon:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   All four of these groups are different.\n    *   Therefore, C-2 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule does not have an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Analyze dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid.\n    *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   Let's look for chiral centers. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The two central carbons are sp2 hybridized and part of a double bond.\n    *   Let's check for overall molecular chirality. The molecule is relatively planar. It has a center of inversion (also called a center of symmetry) located at the midpoint of the C=C bond. Any molecule that possesses a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate will not. The compound labeled (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching these conclusions with the options:\n*   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (Incorrect), B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Correct)\n*   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (Incorrect), B = dimethyl fumarate (Incorrect)\n*   C) A = benzoquinone (Correct), B = dimethyl fumarate (Incorrect)\n*   D) A = benzoquinone (Correct), B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Correct)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\n*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers can interconvert by a chemical reaction called tautomerization.

Each methylene group (`-CH2-`) is located between two carbonyl groups (`C=O`). The hydrogen atoms on these methylene groups are α-hydrogens. They are particularly acidic and can easily move to an adjacent oxygen atom, forming an enol. In fact, this compound exists predominantly in its tautomeric form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is stabilized by aromaticity. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):** This molecule consists of a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O groups. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them.

This is a planar molecule (around the C=C bond) and possesses a plane of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.
