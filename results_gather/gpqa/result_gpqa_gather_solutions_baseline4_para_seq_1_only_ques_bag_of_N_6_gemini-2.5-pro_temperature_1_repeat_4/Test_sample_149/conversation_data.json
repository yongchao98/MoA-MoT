The triplet (t) indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons, meaning it's next to a -CH2- group. This confirms the presence of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group. The doublet (d) indicates it is coupled to one adjacent proton, which is the aldehyde proton. This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment. The chemical shift is consistent with a methylene group attached to both a benzene ring (benzylic position) and a carbonyl group.\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shifts are upfield (less than 7.26 ppm), suggesting the presence of an electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons strongly suggests a primary amine (-NH2) group, which is a powerful electron-donating group, consistent with the upfield aromatic signals.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and a 2-oxoethyl group (-CH2CHO).\n    *   Let's verify the molecular formula of 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal (also known as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde):\n        *   C6H4 (from the ring) + C2H3O (from -CH2CHO) + NH2 = C8H9NO.\n    *   The structure perfectly matches all the provided data.\n\n**Starting Material:** 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n```\n      CHO\n      |\n      CH2\n      |\n  /-----\\\n //     \\\\\n|       |\n \\\\     //\n  \\-----/\n      |\n      NH2\n```\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O.**\n    *   This is a standard two-step procedure to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    *   **Step 1 (Diazotization):** The primary amine (-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2, formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl) at low temperatures to form a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   **Step 2 (Hydrolysis):** Gentle warming of the aqueous solution of the diazonium salt causes it to react with water, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH) and releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n    *   The product of this step is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal** (or 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n\n**Intermediate Product:** 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal\n```\n      CHO\n      |\n      CH2\n      |\n  /-----\\\n //     \\\\\n|       |\n \\\\     //\n  \\-----/\n      |\n      OH\n```\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat.**\n    *   We are now reacting an aldehyde that has acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group) with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This is a classic **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This results in an aldol addition product.\n        *   Product of addition: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option A).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions strongly favors the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) and the acidic proton on the α-carbon (C2) are removed, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. This creates a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        *   The aldol addition product `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO` loses water.\n        *   The final condensation product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Final Product:** 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal\n```\n                            H   CHO\n                            |  /\n      HO-\\-----/--CH2--C = C\n          \\---/       |\n                      /-----\\--OH\n                     /       \\\n                    |         |\n                     \\       /\n                      \\-----/\n```\nThe IUPAC name for this structure is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal, which matches option D.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n1.  The starting material is 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal.\n2.  Diazotization followed by hydrolysis converts the amino group to a hydroxyl group, yielding 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal.\n3.  Base-catalyzed self-condensation with heat leads to the formation of an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, which is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n        DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n        A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). This leaves one additional degree of unsaturation, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the oxygen atom and the NMR data.\n\n    *   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** The chemical shift is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1 rule, n=2), indicating a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n        *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.0 ppm) are characteristic of a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. Each signal is a doublet representing two equivalent protons.\n        *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet (bs) for two protons is typical for the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to hydrogen exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n        *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal for two protons is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one adjacent proton (n=1). This corresponds to the -CH2- group, which is coupled to the single aldehyde proton. The chemical shift is appropriate for a benzylic methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl.\n\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:**\n        We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n        The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify the formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (side chain) = C8H9NO. This matches.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n    *   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n        This set of reagents converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The -NH2 group on the benzene ring is converted to -N2+Cl-.\n        The intermediate is **4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n    *   **Reagent 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n        Adding water and warming the diazonium salt solution causes the diazonium group (-N2+) to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n        The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    *   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n        4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde with acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-aldol condensation.\n\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated to form an aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This is option A).\n        4.  **Dehydration:** The condition \"Heat\" indicates that the reaction proceeds further. The aldol addition product undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The hydroxyl group on carbon 3 and the acidic proton on carbon 2 are eliminated.\n\n        The final product is the aldol condensation product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n    *   The structure of the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, formed before dehydration. The \"Heat\" condition makes this unlikely to be the final product.\n        B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect structure. The phenyl groups should have hydroxyl substituents, and the double bond position is wrong.\n        C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure. This would result from a different reaction, not a self-condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - This name correctly describes the final α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed from the self-condensation and dehydration of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nFirst, we need to deduce the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO from its 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5. A DoU of 4 is typical for a benzene ring, and the remaining 1 corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (1 proton sees 2 adjacent protons, 2+1=3, a triplet).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of an amino group (-NH2). The broadness is due to rapid proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) splitting means it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-), which is consistent with it being coupled to the aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n    *   Let's check if the structure, 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal (or 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde), matches the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n        *   Benzene ring (C6H4) + Amino group (NH2) + Acetaldehyde group (C2H3O) = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO.\n    *   The structure is consistent with all the data.\n\n    The starting material is:\n    ```\n        O=CH-CH2-Ph-NH2 (para-substituted)\n    ```\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nNow, we trace the starting material through the given series of reactions.\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    *   These reagents are used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The reaction is typically carried out at low temperatures (0-5 °C).\n    *   The primary amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   The product of this step is 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O**\n    *   Adding water to the diazonium salt solution and warming it up results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a standard method to synthesize phenols from anilines.\n    *   The product of this step is 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal (or 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n    ```\n        O=CH-CH2-Ph-OH (para-substituted)\n    ```\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves reacting the product from step 2, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, with a strong base (KOH) and heat.\n    *   4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde that has protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- protons).\n    *   Aldehydes with α-hydrogens undergo a base-catalyzed aldol condensation. Since there is only one type of aldehyde, this will be a self-condensation.\n    *   The reaction proceeds in two stages:\n        1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton from one aldehyde molecule to form an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n            The structure of the aldol addition product is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (C).\n        2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction mixture is heated. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the aldol addition product. The α-proton and the β-hydroxyl group are removed, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. This results in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n            The formation of the conjugated system (C=C double bond conjugated with both a phenyl ring and the carbonyl group) makes this dehydration step thermodynamically favorable.\n\n    Let's determine the structure of the final condensation product:\n    *   Aldol addition product: `(HO-Ph)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ph-OH)-CHO`\n    *   Dehydration removes the -OH from C3 and an -H from C2:\n    *   Final Product: `(HO-Ph)-CH2-CH=C(Ph-OH)-CHO`\n    *   The systematic name for this structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Matching the Product with Options**\n\n*   The final product derived from the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n*   Comparing this with the given options:\n    *   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure and lacks hydroxyl groups.\n    *   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This perfectly matches our derived final product.\n    *   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n    *   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DBE) and one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE), which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) indicates it's adjacent to a CH₂ group (n+1 rule, 2+1=3 peaks). So, we have a -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This corresponds to the CH₂ group adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet (d) is due to coupling with the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2 peaks). This confirms the -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets with an integration of 2H, are classic for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons in this region is typical for a primary amine (-NH₂).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have three fragments:\n    1.  A para-substituted benzene ring (C₆H₄)\n    2.  An ethyl-aldehyde group (-CH₂CHO)\n    3.  An amino group (-NH₂)\n\n    Connecting these fragments gives the structure 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde. The -NH₂ and -CH₂CHO groups are at positions 1 and 4 of the benzene ring. The chemical shifts support this: the electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its ortho protons (making them appear at a lower ppm, 6.51 ppm), while the protons ortho to the -CH₂CHO group are less shielded (higher ppm, 6.98 ppm).\n\n    **Starting Material (A):** 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n     \n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Reaction 1 & 2: NaNO₂ + HCl, followed by H₂O.**\n    1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl (0-5 °C):** These are the reagents for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    2.  **H₂O (often with gentle warming):** The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water to replace the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas (N₂). This is a standard synthesis of phenols from anilines.\n\n    The product after these two steps is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde (B)**.\n     \n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat.**\n    *   The reagent is a strong base (KOH) with heat, and the substrate is an aldehyde (2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde) with acidic α-protons (the protons on the carbon adjacent to the C=O group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate ion.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic enolate ion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. This forms an aldol addition product (an alkoxide).\n        3.  **Protonation:** The alkoxide is protonated by water to give the aldol addition product, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (C)**. This corresponds to option (B).\n        4.  **Dehydration:** The condition \"Heat\" strongly favors the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group at C-3 and the acidic proton at C-2 are removed, forming a double bond between C-2 and C-3. This dehydration step is called condensation. The product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, which is stabilized by conjugation between the new C=C double bond, the C=O group, and one of the phenyl rings.\n\n    **Final Product (D):** The final product is the result of this dehydration.\n    The structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n     \n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This name perfectly matches the structure of our derived final product from the aldol condensation.\n*   B) **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal:** This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which would dehydrate upon heating.\n*   C) **2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal:** This molecule lacks the hydroxyl groups on the phenyl rings.\n*   D) **4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal:** This molecule is not a dimer; it results from a different reaction pathway.\n\nGiven the reaction conditions, especially the application of heat, the condensation product is the expected final product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBE) and one additional degree of unsaturation (a C=C or C=O double bond, or another ring).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a CH2 group), according to the n+1 rule. This suggests a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to 2 protons. Its chemical shift is typical for protons on a carbon adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like an aldehyde or an aromatic ring). The splitting, a doublet (d), indicates it's adjacent to a carbon with 1 proton (a CH group). This is consistent with the aldehyde proton, confirming the `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets, each integrating to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring (an aniline derivative). The broadness is due to fast proton exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified, we have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. One substituent is the amino group (-NH2), and the other is the 2-oxoethyl group (-CH2-CHO).\n    The structure is 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal (also known as p-aminophenylacetaldehyde).\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2 + CHO = C8H(4+2+2+1)NO = C8H9NO. The structure matches the given formula and all NMR data.\n    Starting Material:\n     ![Starting Material: 2-(4-aminophenyl) ethanal](https://i.imgur.com/8Qh1e4h.png)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This is the standard procedure for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n    The product after this step is 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride.\n     \n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    The diazonium salt is then treated with water. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group via a substitution reaction (hydrolysis), releasing nitrogen gas (N2). This reaction forms a phenol.\n    The product after this step is 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal (also known as p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n     ![Phenol Intermediate: 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) ethanal](https://i.imgur.com/i9oF2vR.png)\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq.

When treated with a strong base (KOH) and heat, it undergoes a self-**aldol condensation**.\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic alpha-proton to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product.\n        The structure of this addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n         \n    3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction condition specifies \"Heat\". Heating the aldol addition product causes the elimination of a molecule of water (dehydration). The hydroxyl group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed. This forms an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This dehydration is highly favorable because the resulting double bond is in conjugation with both the aldehyde's carbonyl group and the aromatic ring on C2, creating a very stable, extended conjugated system.\n        The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n         \n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents (phenyl instead of hydroxyphenyl) and wrong double bond position.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure; only has one hydroxyphenyl group.\n*   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final, dehydrated aldol condensation product.

The DBE is calculated as:\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (DBE=4) plus one additional double bond or ring (DBE=1), which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Spectroscopy Data Interpretation:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly indicative of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), means it's coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1 rule: 2+1=3), suggesting a -CH2- group is next to the aldehyde. This confirms a **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for an exchangeable group like -OH or -NH2. Given the presence of nitrogen in the molecular formula, this is an **amino group (-NH2)**.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a CH2 group. The splitting, a doublet (d), indicates it's coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1 rule: 1+1=2). This corresponds to the aldehyde proton, confirming the **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with an -NH2 group and a -CH2-CHO group as the two substituents.\n    The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (side chain) + NH2 (amino) = C8H(4+3+2)NO = C8H9NO. This matches perfectly.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    This set of reagents converts a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    The starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, reacts to form 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    *   Intermediate 1: `Cl- +N2-(C6H4)-CH2-CHO`\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt and warming causes hydrolysis, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This is a standard method for synthesizing phenols.\n    The product is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Intermediate 2: `HO-(C6H4)-CH2-CHO`\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Self-Aldol Condensation)**\n    We now have an aldehyde (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) that possesses acidic alpha-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-aldol condensation.\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms an aldol addition product, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option B).\n    3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily eliminates a molecule of water. The proton from the alpha-carbon (C2) and the hydroxyl group from the beta-carbon (C3) are removed, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. This results in a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n    The final structure is:\n    ```\n          (HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH=C(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)\n              C4      C3   C2   C1\n    ```\n    The IUPAC name for this compound is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nComparing the final product with the given options:\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate before dehydration. The heat drives the reaction to the final condensation product.\n*   C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect structure; lacks the hydroxyl groups formed in step 2.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - This is the correct name for the final α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed from the self-aldol condensation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO).**\n    *   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n        *   DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2\n        *   DBE = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n        *   A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE).\n\n    *   **Analyze the 1H-NMR spectrum:**\n        *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2), indicating a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n        *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) multiplicity means it is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment, as this CH2 group is coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n        *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The relatively upfield chemical shifts (compared to benzene at 7.26 ppm) suggest the ring has an electron-donating substituent.\n        *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of an amine group (-NH2). The broadness is due to rapid proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom. An -NH2 group is a strong electron-donating group, consistent with the upfield aromatic signals.\n\n    *   **Assemble the structure:**\n        *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n        *   Let's check if the molecular formula matches: C6H4 (from the ring) + C2H3O (from -CH2CHO) + NH2 (from the amine) = C8H(4+3+2)NO = C8H9NO. This matches.\n        *   The C=O bond of the aldehyde accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n        *   Therefore, the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n    *   **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O.**\n        *   The reaction of a primary aromatic amine (like the one in our starting material) with NaNO2 and a strong acid (HCl) at low temperatures (0-5 °C, which is standard for this reaction) is a **diazotization reaction**. It converts the amino group (-NH2) into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n        *   The subsequent addition of water (H2O), usually with gentle warming, causes the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas), and it is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) from the water.\n        *   So, this two-step process effectively converts the -NH2 group on the benzene ring to an -OH group.\n        *   Product after step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    *   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat.**\n        *   We are now reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat.\n        *   The starting molecule for this step, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has an aldehyde functional group and acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- protons).\n        *   These conditions are classic for an **aldol condensation**.\n        *   **Mechanism:**\n            1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an alpha-proton from one molecule to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion.\n                `HO-Ph-CH2-CHO + OH- <=> [HO-Ph-CH-CHO]- + H2O`\n            2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate ion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n            3.  **Aldol Addition:** After protonation (from water), this forms an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The structure is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option A).\n            4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. Heating an aldol addition product in the presence of base (or acid) causes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The hydroxyl group at the β-position (C3) and a proton from the α-position (C2) are eliminated.\n                *   Addition Product: `HO-Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(PhOH)-CHO`\n                *   Elimination of H2O yields: `HO-Ph-CH2-CH=C(PhOH)-CHO`\n            5.  **Final Product Structure and Name:** The final dehydrated product has a but-2-enal chain with 4-hydroxyphenyl groups at positions 2 and 4. Its IUPAC name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    The question asks for the final product of the entire reaction sequence. Since the last step involves heating, the reaction will not stop at the aldol addition stage (product A) but will proceed to the more stable, dehydrated aldol condensation product (product B).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DBE = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation, and a carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for 1. This matches our calculated DBE of 5.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH2-), which has 2 protons (n+1 = 2+1 = 3 peaks, a triplet).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to a single adjacent proton (n+1 = 1+1 = 2 peaks, a doublet). This confirms the `-CH2-CHO` fragment, as the CH2 group is coupled to the CHO proton.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for an amine group (-NH2).\n\n*   **Putting the pieces together:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring, an amino group (-NH2), and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO). The only way to assemble these fragments is to have the amino group and the acetaldehyde group at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring.\n    The starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    Structure of Starting Material:\n     \n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This is the standard set of reagents for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2⁺Cl⁻).\n    The product after this step is **4-(diazoniomethyl)phenylacetaldehyde chloride**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to an aromatic diazonium salt, usually with gentle warming, results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This is a hydrolysis reaction that forms a phenol. Nitrogen gas (N2) is evolved.\n    The product after this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    Structure of Intermediate:\n     \n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat, applied to an aldehyde (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) that possesses α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes an α-hydrogen to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product. In this case, the addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option A).\n\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The term \"condensation\" implies the loss of a small molecule, in this case, water. The presence of **heat** strongly favors the dehydration of the initial aldol adduct. A proton is removed from the α-carbon (C2), and the hydroxyl group is eliminated from the β-carbon (C3). This elimination forms a double bond between C2 and C3, resulting in a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The conjugation of the newly formed C=C bond with the C=O group and the adjacent aromatic ring makes this product thermodynamically favored.\n\n    The final product is the dehydrated condensation product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n    Let's trace the formation:\n    1.  **Aldol Adduct (matches Option A):**\n         \n    2.  **Dehydration under heat:**\n         \n    3.  **Final Product (matches Option B):**\n         \n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction sequence converts 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This intermediate then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. Because the reaction is heated, it proceeds beyond the initial aldol addition product (A) to the final, dehydrated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde (B). Therefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n**1. Analysis of the Starting Material (C8H9NO) from NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as follows:\n    *   DU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4 = 5.\n    *   A DU of 5 suggests a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DU) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Spectroscopy Data Interpretation:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde. It appears as a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2 peaks). The chemical shift suggests it's also attached to an electron-withdrawing group, like the benzene ring. So we have a `-CH2-CHO` (phenylacetaldehyde) fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group. Its broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and exchange with trace amounts of water.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent is an acetaldehyde group (-CH2-CHO).\n    *   Putting it all together, the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (side chain) + NH2 = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    *   These reagents are used to convert a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The reaction is typically carried out at low temperatures (0-5 °C).\n    *   The amino group (-NH2) on the 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted to a diazonium chloride group (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   The product is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    *   Adding water to the diazonium salt and warming the mixture causes the diazonium group to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction, releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n    *   The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    *   This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an aldol condensation.\n    *   The reactant, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group between the ring and the aldehyde). It can therefore act as both the nucleophile (after deprotonation to form an enolate) and the electrophile. This will result in a self-aldol condensation.\n\n**3. Mechanism of the Aldol Condensation**\n\n*   **a) Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH-  ⇌  [HO-C6H4-CH(-)-CHO] + H2O`\n\n*   **b) Nucleophilic Attack (Aldol Addition):** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    `[Enolate] + HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO  →  Alkoxide intermediate`\n\n*   **c) Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to give the aldol addition product.\n    `Aldol Addition Product: HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO`\n    The systematic name of this product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n*   **d) Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**, which promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The acidic proton on C2 (alpha to the carbonyl) and the hydroxyl group on C3 are eliminated.\n    `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO  --Heat-->  HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO + H2O`\n\n*   **Final Product Identification:** The final product is `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO`. Let's name this compound:\n    *   The main chain contains the aldehyde and the double bond. It is four carbons long: `C4-C3=C2-C1`.\n    *   The parent name is **but-2-enal**.\n    *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group on carbon 2.\n    *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group on carbon 4.\n    *   The full name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThis name matches option (A).

The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), as per the n+1 rule (n=2 protons). This confirms the fragment **-CH2-CHO**. The DBE of 1 is accounted for by the C=O bond.\n            *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring. A 1,4-disubstituted pattern often gives two doublets, each integrating to two protons.\n            *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to 2H is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH2). The broadness is due to rapid proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n            *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a single proton (n=1), which is the aldehyde proton from our earlier analysis. This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment. The chemical shift is consistent with a benzylic CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl.\n\n        *   **Assemble the Structure:**\n            We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2-CHO group. Assembling these gives **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (side chain) + NH2 (amine) = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n    2.  **Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n        *   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n        *   **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O**\n            This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n            1.  **Diazotization:** The primary amine (-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl) to form a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). The aldehyde group remains unchanged. The intermediate is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n            2.  **Hydrolysis:** Gently warming the aqueous solution of the diazonium salt causes it to decompose, replacing the -N2+ group with an -OH group and releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n            The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n        *   **Reagent 3: aq.

These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**. The reaction is a self-condensation since only one type of aldehyde is present.\n\n            *   **Step A: Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n                The product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n            *   **Step B: Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. The heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The acidic α-proton (on C2) is removed, and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) leaves, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. This dehydration is highly favorable because it creates a conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which is thermodynamically very stable.\n                The final condensation product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n    3.  **Identify the Final Product**\n\n        *   The question asks for the final product after all three reaction steps, including heat.

A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation, and a carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for one, which fits.\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a -CH2- group), according to the n+1 rule.\n    *   **3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal for two protons is a doublet (d), indicating it is coupled to one adjacent proton (the aldehyde -CHO proton). The chemical shift is appropriate for a methylene group alpha to both an aldehyde and a benzene ring. This confirms the presence of a **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The relatively upfield chemical shifts (normal aromatic protons are ~7.2 ppm) suggest the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons in this region is highly indicative of a primary amine group (**-NH2**) attached to the aromatic ring. Aniline derivatives often show such signals. The -NH2 group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are an -NH2 group and a -CH2-CHO group.\n    *   Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n    *   Therefore, the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    *   This is the standard procedure for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt, -N2+Cl-.\n    *   The product of this step is 4-(diazonium)phenylacetaldehyde chloride.\n*   **Reagent 2: H2O, Heat**\n    *   Treating an aromatic diazonium salt with water and heat results in the replacement of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The starting material for this step is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This molecule contains both an aldehyde group and acidic alpha-protons (on the -CH2- group).\n    *   The conditions (a strong base like KOH and heat) are classic for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic alpha-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        3.  **Protonation:** An intermediate alkoxide is protonated (by water) to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product. The structure of this intermediate is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option B).\n        4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The acidic proton on the alpha-carbon (C2) is removed, and the hydroxyl group on the beta-carbon (C3) is eliminated. This forms a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n\n*   Let's determine the structure of the final dehydrated product.\n*   The aldol addition product is:\n    `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4-OH)-CHO`\n*   Elimination of water (H from C2 and OH from C3) gives a double bond between C2 and C3:\n    `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4-OH)-CHO`\n*   Let's name this final product based on IUPAC rules:\n    *   The main chain is a butenal (4 carbons, aldehyde, C=C double bond).\n    *   The aldehyde is C1. The double bond starts at C2, so it is a **but-2-enal**.\n    *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group on C2.\n    *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group on C4.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThis name and structure match option D. The presence of \"Heat\" in the final step is a key indicator that the reaction proceeds to the final condensation product rather than stopping at the aldol addition product (Option B).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula (C8H9NO) and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n    1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n        DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n        A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., a C=O or C=C bond).\n\n    2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR spectrum:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** The chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons, likely a CH2 group. This suggests a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for an amino group (-NH2) attached to an aromatic ring. The nitrogen atom in the molecular formula supports this.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH2 group. The splitting, a doublet (d), indicates it is coupled to one proton, which is the aldehyde proton. This confirms the `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n\n    3.  **Assemble the structure:**\n        We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n        The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n        Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2CHO = C8H(4+2+2+1)NO = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula. The DBE is 4 (ring) + 1 (C=O) = 5, which is also correct.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n    *   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n        This is a standard diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n        Starting material: 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n        Product after step 1: 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride. The structure has a `[N≡N]+Cl-` group in place of the `NH2` group.\n\n    *   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n        Adding water to the diazonium salt (usually with warming) causes hydrolysis. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        Intermediate: 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride\n        Product after step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    *   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n        This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde with two acidic α-hydrogens (on the CH2 group). This is a classic setup for an **aldol condensation**.\n\n        *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-hydrogen from one aldehyde molecule to form an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product.\n            Let R = 4-hydroxyphenyl (HO-C6H4-). The starting aldehyde is R-CH2-CHO.\n            The aldol addition product is `R-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(R)-CHO`, which is named **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option D).\n\n        *   **Condensation (Dehydration):** The term \"Heat\" indicates that the reaction will likely not stop at the aldol addition product. The β-hydroxy aldehyde will undergo dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated product. The -OH group from C3 and the acidic H from C2 (alpha to the carbonyl) are eliminated.\n            `R-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(R)-CHO` --(Heat, -H2O)--> `R-CH2-CH=C(R)-CHO`\n            The product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the final product structure and match it with the options.**\n\n    *   The structure of the final condensation product is `(HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO`.\n    *   Let's name this structure according to IUPAC rules:\n        - The main chain is a butenal (4 carbons with a C=C and a C=O).\n        - The aldehyde is C1, so the double bond is between C2 and C3. It is a **but-2-enal**.\n        - There is a 4-hydroxyphenyl group on C2.\n        - There is a 4-hydroxyphenyl group on C4.\n        - The full name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n    *   This name and structure perfectly match **Option A**.\n\n    *   **Why not D?** Option D, `3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal`, is the aldol *addition* product. The presence of \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions strongly favors the subsequent dehydration to form the more thermodynamically stable conjugated system (the aldol *condensation* product). Therefore, A is the final product, not D.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material (C8H9NO) from the 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The formula for DoU is: C + 1 - H/2 + N/2\n    *   DoU = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond or ring. The C=O bond of an aldehyde would account for this.\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR signals:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift (> 9 ppm) is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1 rule: 2+1=3), indicating a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group. The chemical shift is consistent with a methylene group attached to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group. The splitting is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to one adjacent proton (1+1=2), which is the aldehyde proton. This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons in this region is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring. The broadness is due to rapid proton exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n\n*   **Assemble the structure:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an ethanal group (-CH2CHO).\n    *   Putting these together gives the structure: **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (ethanal part) + NH2 = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n\n**Step 2: Follow the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n    ```\n        H2N-Ph-CH2-CHO  (where Ph is a 1,4-phenylene ring)\n    ```\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl (at 0-5 °C)**\n    *   This is a classic **diazotization reaction**. It converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt.\n    *   The -NH2 group is converted to -N₂⁺Cl⁻.\n    *   **Intermediate A:** 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride\n    ```\n        [Cl⁻][⁺N≡N]-Ph-CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H2O, Heat**\n    *   This reaction is the **hydrolysis of a diazonium salt**. When the aqueous solution of the diazonium salt is warmed, the diazonium group (-N₂⁺) is an excellent leaving group and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) from water. Nitrogen gas (N₂) is evolved.\n    *   **Intermediate B:** 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal (also known as 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde)\n    ```\n        HO-Ph-CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves reacting an aldehyde (Intermediate B) that has α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group) with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the conditions for an **aldol condensation**. Since only one type of aldehyde is present, it will be a self-condensation.\n\n    *   **a) Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-hydrogen to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives the aldol addition product.\n        *   **Aldol Adduct:** 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (C).\n        ```\n                  OH\n                  |\n           HO-Ph-CH(CHO)-CH-CH2-Ph-OH\n        ```\n        *(This is the structure of option C)*\n\n    *   **b) Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct to form a more stable α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The acidic hydrogen on the carbon α to the aldehyde (C2) and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) are eliminated.\n        *   **Final Product:** The dehydration leads to the formation of a double bond between C2 and C3.\n        ```\n                 (Heat, -H₂O)\n           [Adduct from above]   -------->   HO-Ph-C(CHO)=CH-CH2-Ph-OH\n        ```\n        *   Let's name this final product: The parent chain is a butenal. The double bond is at C2 (`but-2-enal`). There are two 4-hydroxyphenyl groups, one at C2 and one at C4.\n        *   The name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe question asks for the **final product** of the entire reaction sequence. The inclusion of \"Heat\" in the final step indicates that the reaction proceeds to the thermodynamically more stable condensation product, not stopping at the aldol addition stage. Therefore, the final product is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed after dehydration.\n\n*   Starting Material: 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n*   After Diazotization/Hydrolysis: 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal\n*   After Aldol Condensation (with heat): **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\n*   **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting material, C8H9NO, from its 1H-NMR data.**\n\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula is C8H9NO. The DoU is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5. A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.

This confirms the presence of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both appearing as doublets and integrating to 2 protons each, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The relatively upfield chemical shifts (typically 7.0-7.5 for benzene) suggest the ring is substituted with at least one strong electron-donating group.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is often due to an exchangeable group like -OH or -NH2.

This provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The α-hydrogen and the β-hydroxyl group are eliminated to form a double bond between the α and β carbons. This dehydration is driven by the formation of a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n            \n            *   Aldol addition product: `HO-C6H4-CH(CHO)-CH(OH)-CH2-C6H4-OH`\n            *   Dehydration removes the -OH from C3 and an -H from C2.\n            *   Final Condensation Product: `HO-C6H4-C(CHO)=CH-CH2-C6H4-OH`\n\n    *   **Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n\n        *   The structure formed after dehydration is named as follows:\n            *   The main chain is a butenal (a four-carbon chain with an aldehyde and a double bond).\n            *   The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it's a but-2-enal.\n            *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group at position C2 and another at position C4.\n            *   The systematic name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n        *   This matches option A.

The triplet multiplicity (t) means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1 rule, n=2), suggesting a -CH2-CHO group.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene protons (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet multiplicity (d) confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (n=1). This confirms the presence of an acetaldehyde moiety (-CH2CHO).\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons and appearing as doublets, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons is characteristic of an amine group (-NH2). The protons are exchangeable, leading to broadening.\n\n    *   **Assemble the structure:** We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring, with an -NH2 group and a -CH2CHO group as substituents. The formula for C6H4(NH2)(CH2CHO) is C6+1+1 H4+2+2+1 N O = C8H9NO. This matches the molecular formula.\n    *   The starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n    *   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl at 0-5°C (Diazotization)**\n        This reaction converts a primary aromatic amine (Ar-NH2) into a diazonium salt (Ar-N2+ Cl-).\n        So, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted to the corresponding diazonium salt: (4-(diazonio)phenyl)acetaldehyde chloride.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Reaction 2: H2O (Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt)**\n        Warming an aqueous solution of an aryl diazonium salt causes the diazonium group (-N2+) to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        The diazonium salt is converted to **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Reaction 3: aq.

In the presence of a base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-aldol condensation.\n\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        3.  **Protonation:** An acid-base reaction with water yields the aldol addition product, a β-hydroxy aldehyde: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal.\n        4.  **Dehydration:** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily dehydrates by eliminating a molecule of water to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.

The \"Heat\" in the conditions makes dehydration likely.\n    *   B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect. The hydroxyl groups on the phenyl rings are missing.\n    *   C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final aldol *condensation* product (after dehydration). The name correctly describes the structure derived from the reaction mechanism.\n    *   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect. This product would result from a different reaction and has only one phenyl ring.\n\nThe correct final product is the one formed after the dehydration step, which is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the given NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5. A benzene ring accounts for 4 DBEs, and a carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for 1 DBE, which totals 5. This suggests the presence of both a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it is adjacent to a CH₂ group (n+1 rule, 2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH₂ group. Its chemical shift suggests it's adjacent to both an electron-withdrawing group (the aldehyde) and an aromatic ring. The splitting pattern, a doublet (d), confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2 peaks). This confirms the presence of a **-CH₂-CHO** (acetaldehyde) fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are classic signals for a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons in this region is indicative of a primary amine group (-NH₂) attached to an aromatic ring. The protons are exchangeable, which often results in a broad signal. The upfield shift of one of the aromatic doublets (6.51 ppm) is consistent with the strong electron-donating effect of an -NH₂ group.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are an amine group (-NH₂) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO).\n    *   The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify the molecular formula: C₆H₄ (ring) + C₂H₃O (acetaldehyde group) + NH₂ = **C₈H₉NO**. This matches the given formula.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO₂ + HCl (at low temperature, typically 0-5 °C)**\n    *   This is the **diazotization** reaction. A primary aromatic amine (Ar-NH₂) reacts with nitrous acid (HONO, formed in situ from NaNO₂ and HCl) to form an aromatic diazonium salt (Ar-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    *   The product of this step is **p-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride** ([N₂⁺]-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H₂O, Heat**\n    *   Aromatic diazonium salts are generally unstable and react with water upon warming to replace the diazonium group (-N₂⁺) with a hydroxyl group (-OH). Nitrogen gas (N₂) is evolved as a byproduct.\n    *   The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde** (HO-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq.

These are the classic conditions for a **base-catalyzed self-aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. After protonation of the resulting alkoxide, an aldol addition product is formed.\n            *   Intermediate Product (Aldol Adduct): **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (D).\n        2.  **Condensation (Dehydration):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (elimination of a water molecule). The base removes the acidic alpha-proton (at C2), and the hydroxyl group from the beta-carbon (C3) leaves. This forms a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The stability is enhanced because the new C=C double bond is in conjugation with both the aldehyde's C=O group and one of the aromatic rings.\n            *   Final Product (Condensation Product): The double bond forms between C2 and C3, resulting in **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product.**\n\nThe question asks for the final product. Given the condition \"Heat\", the reaction will not stop at the aldol addition stage (D). The elimination of water is thermodynamically favorable due to the formation of a highly conjugated system.

The doublet (d) splitting indicates it is coupled to a single adjacent proton (a doublet means 1 adjacent proton). This corresponds to the aldehyde proton. So, we have confirmed the presence of a `-CH2-CHO` group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield (benzene is ~7.3 ppm), which suggests the ring is substituted with an electron-donating group.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet for 2 protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring. The nitrogen in the molecular formula and the electron-donating nature required to explain the upfield aromatic shifts confirm this assignment.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified (-CHO, -CH2-, 1,4-disubstituted benzene, -NH2), the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Formula check: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2 + CHO = C8H9NO.

This is favored because it results in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new C=C double bond is conjugated with the C=O of the aldehyde group, as well as one of the phenyl rings.\n\n        The structure of the final dehydrated product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n        ```\n              OH         O         OH                   OH          O         OH\n              |         ||         |                   |          ||         |\n        C6H4-CH2-CH-CH(C6H4)-CHO   --(Heat, -H2O)-->   C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4)-CHO\n           (Aldol Adduct - Option B)                 (Aldol Condensation Product - Option A)\n        ```\n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   The final product derived from the reaction sequence is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n*   This matches option A.\n*   Option B is the intermediate aldol adduct, which is not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   Options C and D have incorrect structures/functional groups.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula C8H9NO and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The formula for DoU is C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2), where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.\n    DoU = 8 + 1 - (9/2) - (0/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond or ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** The chemical shift (> 9 ppm) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent equivalent protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). This points to a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde. It's a doublet (d) because it's coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2). This confirms the **-CH2-CHO** (acetaldehyde) group. This group also contains a C=O double bond, which accounts for the final degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.0 ppm), both doublets and integrating to 2 protons each, are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for an amino group (**-NH2**) attached to the aromatic ring. The protons are exchangeable, leading to a broad signal.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with an -NH2 group and a -CH2-CHO group as substituents.\n    The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula:\n    C6H4 (from the ring) + C2H3O (from -CH2CHO) + NH2 = C8H(4+3+2)NO = **C8H9NO**. The formula matches.\n    So, the starting material is correctly identified as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n1.  **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O**\n    *   The first step (NaNO2, HCl, typically at 0-5 °C) is the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   The intermediate is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    *   The second step (addition of H2O, usually with gentle warming) is the **hydrolysis** of the diazonium salt. The -N2+ group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from water. This is a variation of the Sandmeyer reaction.\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Structure: HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n\n2.  **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This is a strong base (KOH) with heat applied to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   This molecule has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**. The \"condensation\" part implies that an initial aldol addition is followed by a dehydration reaction, which is driven by the applied heat.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n        b.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate anion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        c.  **Aldol Addition Product:** After protonation of the resulting alkoxide, the aldol addition product is formed. Its systematic name is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (This corresponds to option A).\n        d.  **Dehydration:** With heating, this aldol adduct readily loses a molecule of water (dehydration). The -OH group from carbon-3 is eliminated along with an α-proton from the adjacent carbon-2.\n        *   Eliminating the H from C2 is highly favored because it creates a double bond between C2 and C3, resulting in an **α,β-unsaturated aldehyde**. This product is thermodynamically very stable because the new C=C double bond is in conjugation with both the aldehyde's C=O group and the phenyl ring at C2.\n        *   The resulting final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the options against the final product.**\n\n*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol *addition* product, an intermediate before the dehydration step caused by heat.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure. This product would result from a different reaction and only contains one of the original monomer units.\n*   C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure. It lacks the hydroxyl groups that are introduced in the second step of the reaction sequence.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final, stable product of the aldol condensation (addition followed by dehydration) of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. The structure matches our derived product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from its molecular formula and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation. The remaining degree of unsaturation corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O), which is suggested by the aldehyde proton in the NMR.\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR data:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), as per the n+1 rule (1H is split by 2H, so 2+1=3 peaks, a triplet). This confirms the presence of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield shifts (compared to benzene at 7.26 ppm) suggest the ring is attached to an electron-donating group.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2H in this region is typical for the protons of a primary amine group (-NH2). The broadening is due to fast proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group. Its doublet (d) splitting confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2 peaks, a doublet). Its chemical shift is consistent with a methylene group positioned between an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Assemble the fragments:**\n    We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a -NH2 group, and a -CH2-CHO group. Assembling these gives 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal (also known as p-aminophenylacetaldehyde).\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: The structure C6H4(NH2)(CH2CHO) has a formula of C8H(4+2+2+1)NO = C8H9NO. This matches the given molecular formula.\n\nThe starting compound is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This is the standard set of reagents for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    The product is 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride.\n    Structure: [N2]+Cl- — C6H4 — CH2-CHO\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to an aqueous solution of an aromatic diazonium salt and gently warming it causes the **hydrolysis** of the diazonium group, replacing it with a hydroxyl (-OH) group and evolving nitrogen gas (N2).\n    The product is 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal (also known as p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n    Structure: HO — C6H4 — CH2-CHO\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This is a strong base (KOH) with heat, applied to an aldehyde that possesses α-hydrogens (the -CH2- group is alpha to the -CHO group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction. The reaction is a self-condensation since only one type of aldehyde is present.\n\n    **Mechanism of Aldol Condensation:**\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The base (OH-) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate ion.\n        HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH- ⇌ [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]- + H2O\n    2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde.\n    3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to give the aldol addition product: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (This corresponds to option B).\n        Structure: HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO\n    4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of \"Heat\" promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The base removes the acidic α-hydrogen (at C2), and the -OH group is eliminated from the β-position (C3). This forms a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO --(Heat, -H2O)--> HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product.**\n\nThe final product after dehydration is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. The formation of the conjugated system (C=C double bond conjugated with the carbonyl group and an aromatic ring) is thermodynamically favored, especially with heating.\n\n*   Let's compare this structure to the given options:\n    *   **A) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This matches our derived final product.\n    *   **B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal:** This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which would dehydrate upon heating.\n    *   **C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal:** This is incorrect as it lacks the hydroxyl groups on the phenyl rings.\n    *   **D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal:** This is incorrect as it only has one hydroxyphenyl substituent and the double bond position is wrong for this reaction.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the NMR data.**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The formula for DBE is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) plus one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** A signal in this region (9-10 ppm) is highly indicative of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1 rule, n=2). This suggests a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the two protons of the -CH2- group inferred above. The doublet (d) multiplicity confirms it is coupled to a single proton (n=1), which is the aldehyde proton. So, we have confirmed the **-CH2-CHO** (phenylacetaldehyde) fragment.\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for an amine group (-NH2), which is consistent with the nitrogen in the molecular formula.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    Putting the pieces together—a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with -NH2 and -CH2-CHO substituents—gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (side chain) + NH2 = C8H9NO. The formula matches perfectly.\n\n**Starting Material:**\n```\n      NH2\n       |\n      / \\\n    ||   ||\n    \\\\   //\n      |\n     CH2-CHO\n```\n(4-aminophenylacetaldehyde)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n1.  **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O (Diazotization followed by Hydrolysis)**\n    *   The first step (NaNO2, HCl, typically at 0-5°C) is the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   The second step (adding H2O and warming) hydrolyzes the diazonium salt, replacing the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The aldehyde group (-CH2-CHO) is unreactive under these conditions.\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Intermediate Product:**\n```\n      OH\n       |\n      / \\\n    ||   ||\n    \\\\   //\n      |\n     CH2-CHO\n```\n(4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde)\n\n2.  **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Base-Catalyzed Aldol Condensation)**\n    *   We have an aldehyde (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) that possesses alpha-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-aldol condensation.\n    *   **Step a: Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an acidic alpha-proton from one molecule to form an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde (an \"aldol\").\n        *   The structure of the aldol addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (which corresponds to option C).\n\n    *   **Step b: Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. This provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. A proton is lost from the alpha-carbon (C2) and the hydroxyl group is lost from the beta-carbon (C3). This forms a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new double bond is conjugated with both the aldehyde's carbonyl group and one of the phenyl rings.\n\n**Final Product Formation:**\n\n*   **Aldol Adduct (from addition):**\n    ```\n            OH         OH\n             |          |\n            / \\        / \\\n          ||   ||-CH2-CH - CH - CHO\n          \\\\   //      |    |\n             |       (Ph-OH)\n    ```\n    (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal)\n\n*   **Dehydration (-H2O) with heat:**\n    ```\n            OH                 OH\n             |                  |\n            / \\                / \\\n          ||   ||-CH2 - CH = C - CHO\n          \\\\   //           |\n             |            (Ph-OH)\n    ```\n    The IUPAC name for this structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option A.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction sequence converts 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation.

A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (DBE=4) and one additional double bond or ring (DBE=1), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Data:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n=2, n+1=3 peaks), indicating a -CH2-CHO group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the CH2 group adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet (d) multiplicity means these two protons are coupled to one adjacent proton (n=1, n+1=2 peaks), which is the aldehyde proton. The chemical shift is consistent with a benzylic CH2 group that is also alpha to a carbonyl. This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a para (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. The upfield shifts (especially 6.51 ppm) suggest the presence of a strong electron-donating group.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The amine group is a strong electron-donating group, which is consistent with the aromatic signals.\n*   **Assemble the structure:**\n    We have the following fragments: a para-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4), an amine group (-NH2), and an ethanal group (-CH2CHO). Assembling these fragments gives the structure 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal (also known as p-aminophenylacetaldehyde).\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4(NH2)(CH2CHO) -> C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n    The starting material is:\n     ![Starting Material: 2-(4-aminophenyl) ethanal](https://i.imgur.com/L1d4g0E.png)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This is the standard diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). The aldehyde group remains unchanged.\n    The product is 2-(4-diazoniophenyl)ethanal chloride.\n    [Cl-][N2+]-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O, Heat**\n    Heating an aqueous solution of an aromatic diazonium salt results in the replacement of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, liberating nitrogen gas (N2). This is a standard method for synthesizing phenols.\n    The product after this step is 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal (or p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n    HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves treating the product from step 2, p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This compound has acidic α-hydrogens (the H's on the -CH2- group) and an aldehyde functional group. These are the classic conditions for a self-aldol condensation.\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-hydrogen to form a resonance-stabilized enolate. The acidic phenolic proton is also removed to form a phenoxide.\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of another molecule of p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond and, after protonation (from water), yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde, known as the aldol addition product. The structure of this adduct is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This is option D).\n    3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is carried out with \"Heat\". This provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct. The acidic α-hydrogen (on C2) and the β-hydroxyl group (on C3) are removed. This dehydration is highly favorable as it results in the formation of an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new C=C double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl group and one of the phenyl rings, leading to a highly stable system.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the final product.**\n\nLet's visualize the aldol condensation:\nReactant: HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO\nAldol Adduct (Option D):\n```\n      CHO        OH\n      |          |\n  HO-Ph-CH --- CH --- CH2-Ph-OH\n```\nThis is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal.\n\nDehydration (due to heat):\nElimination of H2O (the blue H from C2 and OH from C3) gives the final condensation product:\n```\n      CHO\n      |\n  HO-Ph-C==CH---CH2-Ph-OH\n```\nThe IUPAC name for this structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option C.\n\nGiven that the reaction is performed with heating, the reaction will proceed to the most stable product, which is the dehydrated condensation product.

The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n=2, based on the n+1 rule), meaning it is part of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring (A-A'-B-B' system). The upfield chemical shifts (below 7.2 ppm) indicate the presence of a strong electron-donating group (EDG) on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons, coupled with the presence of nitrogen in the formula, points to a primary amine group (-NH2). An amino group is a strong EDG, consistent with the upfield aromatic signals.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The splitting, a doublet (d), indicates it is coupled to one adjacent proton (n=1). This perfectly matches the -CH2- group in the -CH2-CHO fragment, as it is coupled only to the aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:**\n    Assembling the fragments gives a para-substituted benzene ring with an amino group (-NH2) and a 2-oxoethyl group (-CH2-CHO) as substituents.\n    The structure is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n    Let's verify the formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2CHO = C8H9NO. The formula is correct.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    1.  The reaction of a primary aromatic amine with sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and a strong acid (HCl) at low temperatures (0-5 °C) is a **diazotization reaction**. This converts the amino group (-NH2) into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n    2.  Adding water (H2O) to the diazonium salt and warming leads to the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt, replacing the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   The intermediate after these two steps is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The reagent is a strong base (KOH) with heat, and the substrate is an aldehyde with α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group adjacent to the -CHO group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation reaction**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from one molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion.\n        b.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate anion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal.\n        c.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to yield a β-hydroxy aldehyde, the **aldol addition product**. This intermediate is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n        d.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) and a hydrogen atom from the α-carbon (C2) are eliminated. This dehydration step is highly favored because it forms a C=C double bond that is conjugated with both the aldehyde's C=O group and the attached phenyl ring, resulting in a highly stabilized α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n*   **Final Product Identification:**\n    *   The aldol addition product is: (HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4-OH)-CHO\n    *   Upon dehydration, it forms the aldol condensation product: (HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH=C(C6H4-OH)-CHO\n    *   Let's name this molecule based on IUPAC rules:\n        *   The parent chain is a butenal (4-carbon chain with an aldehyde and a double bond).\n        *   The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it is a **but-2-enal**.\n        *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group attached to C2.\n        *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group attached to C4.\n        *   Therefore, the name of the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from its molecular formula and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The formula for DoU is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DoU = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (1) suggests a double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C) or another ring.\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which, according to the n+1 rule, means it is adjacent to a CH2 group (2+1=3 peaks). This points to a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets, each integrating to two protons. This pattern is a classic indicator of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The relatively upfield shifts (especially 6.51 ppm) suggest the presence of a strong electron-donating group.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for an amine (-NH2) or alcohol (-OH) group due to proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling (for N). Given the molecular formula contains nitrogen, this is an -NH2 group. This is a strong electron-donating group, which is consistent with the upfield aromatic signals.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH2 group. The multiplicity is a doublet (d), which means it's coupled to a single proton. This fits perfectly with the `-CH2-CHO` fragment, where this CH2 is coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The two substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n    The structure is therefore **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's verify the formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (side chain) = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This reagent mixture generates nitrous acid (HONO) in situ. This is the first step of the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt, -N2+Cl-.\n    The intermediate is **(4-(2-oxoethyl)phenyl)diazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt solution and warming it causes the diazonium group (-N2+) to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a standard method for synthesizing phenols from anilines.\n    The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Structure: `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO`\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat. The reactant is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which is an aldehyde that possesses two acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the α-protons on the -CH2- group).\n    This set of conditions is perfect for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n    *   **Step 3a (Enolate Formation):** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-proton to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion.\n        `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH- <=> [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]- + H2O`\n    *   **Step 3b (Aldol Addition):** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, known as the aldol addition product. After protonation of the alkoxide intermediate, the structure is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option C).\n    *   **Step 3c (Dehydration/Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. Heating the aldol addition product in a basic solution causes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The α-proton is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group is eliminated, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. This creates a conjugated system (α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which is thermodynamically very stable.\n\n        *   Addition Product: `(HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4-OH)-CHO`\n        *   Elimination of H2O from the C2 (H) and C3 (OH) positions gives:\n        *   Final Product: `(HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH=C(C6H4-OH)-CHO`\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the Final Product.**\n    Let's name the condensation product using IUPAC rules.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the aldehyde is four carbons long: `butanal`.\n    *   The aldehyde carbon is C1.\n    *   There is a double bond between C2 and C3: `but-2-enal`.\n    *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group on C2.\n    *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group attached to the CH2 group at C4.\n    *   The name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThis name and structure match option D. The presence of \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions strongly favors the formation of the dehydrated condensation product (D) over the simple addition product (C).\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer determination:**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n2.  **Intermediate:** 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n3.  **Final Reaction:** Aldol condensation (dimerization with loss of water).\n4.  **Final Product:** 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound from the given molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 typically indicates the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) and one additional double bond or ring.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which means it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-) according to the n+1 rule (1+1=2 neighbours -> triplet, so n=2). This confirms the presence of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region for 2 protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a doublet integrating to 2 protons. This corresponds to the -CH2- group which is adjacent to the aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting is consistent, as the CH2 protons are split by the single CHO proton into a doublet (n+1 = 1+1 = 2). The chemical shift is consistent with a benzylic methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have the following fragments:\n    1.  A para-substituted benzene ring (-C6H4-).\n    2.  An amine group (-NH2).\n    3.  An ethanal group (-CH2CHO).\n    The only way to assemble these fragments to satisfy the formula C8H9NO and the NMR data is to have the -NH2 and -CH2CHO groups at the para (1 and 4) positions of the benzene ring.\n\n    The structure of the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO₂ + HCl**\n    This set of reagents is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N₂⁺).\n    The product is 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride: [⁺N≡N-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO]Cl⁻.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H₂O**\n    Adding water to a diazonium salt and warming (which is implicit in step 3's \"Heat\") causes the diazonium group to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction (hydrolysis of the diazonium salt).\n    The product after this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**: HO-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH₂- group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives the aldol addition product.\n        *   Nucleophile: [HO-C₆H₄-CH-CHO]⁻\n        *   Electrophile: HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO\n        *   Addition Product: After protonation, the product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n            ```\n                  CHO\n                  |\n            HO-Ar-CH  -  CH(OH)  -  CH₂-Ar-OH\n                  (C2)      (C3)       (C4)\n            (where Ar = a phenylene ring)\n            ```\n\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The term \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions indicates that the aldol addition product will likely undergo dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable product. Dehydration of the aldol product involves removing the -OH group from C3 and a proton from an adjacent carbon (C2 or C4).\n        *   Removal of the acidic α-proton from C2 and the -OH from C3 is strongly favored because it results in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The resulting double bond is conjugated with both the carbonyl group and the adjacent phenyl ring, creating a very stable, extended conjugated system.\n        *   The product of this dehydration is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n            ```\n                  CHO\n                  |\n            HO-Ar-C   =   C   -   CH₂-Ar-OH\n                  (C2)  (C3)    (C4)\n            ```\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product.**\n\nThe question asks for the **final product**. In an aldol reaction performed with heat, the reaction generally does not stop at the addition stage (product D). The dehydration step is thermodynamically driven, especially with heating, to form the stable conjugated condensation product (product C). Therefore, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal is the final major product of the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n    1.  **Analysis of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\n        *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - H/2 + N/2`. For C8H9NO, DoU = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5. A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which has a DoU of 4) and one additional degree of unsaturation (like a C=C or C=O bond).\n\n        *   **1H-NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n            *   `9.72 (t, 1H)`: The chemical shift (> 9 ppm) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to 2 adjacent protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). This indicates a `-CH2-CHO` group.\n            *   `3.66 (d, 2H)`: This signal corresponds to 2 protons. The multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to 1 adjacent proton (1+1=2). This fits the `-CH2-` part of the `-CH2-CHO` group, where these two protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n            *   `6.98 (d, 2H)` and `6.51 (d, 2H)`: These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield (compared to benzene at 7.3 ppm), suggesting the presence of at least one electron-donating group.\n            *   `6.27 (bs, 2H)`: This is a broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons, which is typical for a primary amine (-NH2). The protons can exchange, and nitrogen's quadrupole moment often leads to broad signals.\n\n        *   **Structure Determination:**\n            *   We have three fragments: a para-substituted benzene ring (`-C6H4-`), an amino group (`-NH2`), and an ethanal group (`-CH2CHO`).\n            *   Let's assemble them: The two substituents must be `-NH2` and `-CH2CHO` at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring.\n            *   The structure is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal** (also known as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde).\n            *   Let's verify the formula: `C6H4` (ring) + `C2H3O` (ethanal part) + `NH2` (amine part) = `C8H(4+3+2)NO` = `C8H9NO`. This matches the given molecular formula. The structure is consistent with all the data.\n\n    2.  **Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n        *   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (at low temperature, typically 0-5 °C)**\n            *   This is the standard reagent for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The `-NH2` group on the benzene ring is converted to a diazonium salt (`-N2+Cl-`).\n            *   The product of this step is **2-(4-diazoniophenyl)ethanal chloride**.\n\n        *   **Step 2: H2O (usually with warming)**\n            *   This reaction involves the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. The diazonium group (`-N2+`) is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (`-OH`) group from water.\n            *   The product of this step is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal** (also known as 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n\n        *   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n            *   The reactant is now 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal. This is an aldehyde that has two acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the `-CH2-` group).\n            *   KOH is a strong base, and heat is supplied. These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**. Since there's only one type of aldehyde, it will be a **self-condensation**.\n            *   The mechanism involves two main stages:\n                1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an alpha-proton from one aldehyde molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, called the aldol addition product. The structure is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option A).\n                2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **heat** promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The base removes the now even more acidic proton from the α-carbon (C2), and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) is eliminated. This forms a double bond between the α and β carbons. The resulting product is a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new C=C double bond is conjugated with the C=O bond of the aldehyde.\n\n    3.  **Determination of the Final Product**\n\n        *   Let R = 4-hydroxyphenyl.

For C8, this would be C8H19N. The given formula is C8H9NO. The difference in hydrogen atoms is (19+1(for O)) - 9 = 11. Wait, let's use the standard formula: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5. A degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBE) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO).

This sets up the conditions for an **aldol condensation**. Since the aldehyde reacts with itself, it's a self-aldol condensation.\n\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH removes an α-proton from one molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde. Subsequent protonation yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product. In this case, it is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option B).\n    3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions strongly favors the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The α-proton is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group is eliminated, forming a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This is the aldol condensation product.\n\n    Let's trace the formation of the condensation product from the aldol adduct:\n    Adduct: `HO-Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(PhOH)-CHO`\n    Dehydration (loss of H from C-2 and OH from C-3) leads to the formation of a double bond between C-2 and C-3.\n    Final Product: `HO-Ph-CH2-CH=C(PhOH)-CHO`, which is named **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n     ![Final Product: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) but-2-enal](https://i.imgur.com/kS94b2q.png)\n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final, dehydrated aldol condensation product. The structure and name match our derived product.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure; it's missing the hydroxyl groups.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Part 1: Elucidating the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO)**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The formula for DoU is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond or ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR spectrum:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity (t) indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2), which must be a CH2 group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the CH2 group adjacent to the aldehyde. It's a doublet (d) because it's coupled to the single aldehyde proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This confirms the presence of a **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet corresponds to two exchangeable protons, which is typical for an amino group **(-NH2)** attached to the aromatic ring.\n    *   The additional degree of unsaturation is accounted for by the carbonyl group (C=O) of the aldehyde.\n\n3.  **Assemble the structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an ethylaldehyde group (-CH2-CHO).\n    *   Let's check the formula: C6H4(NH2)(CH2CHO) = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n    *   The starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Part 2: Analyzing the reaction sequence**\n\n1.  **Step 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O**\n    *   **Reagent 1 (NaNO2 + HCl):** This is the reagent for **diazotization**. It converts a primary aromatic amine (Ar-NH2) into a diazonium salt (Ar-N2+).\n        *   4-aminophenylacetaldehyde → 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium salt.\n    *   **Reagent 2 (H2O):** Water acts as a nucleophile to replace the diazonium group (-N2+), which is an excellent leaving group, with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction is often driven by gentle warming.\n        *   4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium salt → **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n2.  **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   **Reagent (aq. KOH, Heat):** This indicates a base-catalyzed reaction under heating conditions. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, possesses both an aldehyde functional group and protons on the adjacent carbon (α-protons). This is the perfect substrate for an **aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a.  **Enolate formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        b.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. After protonation, this forms an aldol addition product: a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n            *   Addition Product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (D).\n        c.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The problem specifies \"Heat\". Heating an aldol addition product in the presence of base causes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The hydroxyl group from the β-carbon and a proton from the α-carbon are eliminated, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons.\n            *   Final Product: The resulting product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Part 3: Identifying the Final Product**\n\n*   The sequence of reactions transforms 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n*   This intermediate then undergoes a self-aldol condensation.\n*   The presence of \"Heat\" in the final step is crucial, as it drives the reaction past the initial aldol addition product (D) to the final, dehydrated condensation product (A).\n*   The structure of 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal matches option A.\n\nLet's check the options:\n*   A) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final α,β-unsaturated aldehyde product from the aldol condensation.

The C=O group of an aldehyde or ketone would account for this extra DBE.\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Signals:**\n    *   **`9.72 ppm (t, 1H)`:** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means its neighboring carbon has 2 protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). So, we have a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **`3.66 ppm (d, 2H)`:** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde. Its multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning its neighboring atom has 1 proton (1+1=2). This confirms the coupling with the single aldehyde proton. The fragment is `-CH2-CHO`.\n    *   **`6.98 ppm (d, 2H)` and `6.51 ppm (d, 2H)`:** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets and each integrates to 2 protons. This pattern is characteristic of a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The relatively upfield shifts (normal benzene is ~7.3 ppm) suggest the presence of electron-donating groups.\n    *   **`6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)`:** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. This is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2) attached to an aromatic ring. The broadening is due to nitrogen's quadrupole moment and/or proton exchange.\n\n*   **Assemble the structure:**\n    We have the following fragments:\n    1.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  An amine group (-NH2).\n    3.  An ethylaldehyde group (-CH2-CHO).\n    Combining these pieces, we get 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde. Let's check its molecular formula: C6H4 (from the ring) + CH2CHO + NH2 gives C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n    The starting compound is:\n    ```\n          NH2\n          |\n         / \\\n      ==|   |==\n      | |   | |\n      ==|   |==\n         \\ /\n          |\n         CH2-CHO\n    ```\n    This is 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2: `1. NaNO2 + HCl`, then `2. H2O`**\n    This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    1.  **Diazotization:** The primary amine group (-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl) at low temperature to form a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n        H2N-Ar-CH2CHO -> [Cl-][+N≡N]-Ar-CH2CHO\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water (usually upon gentle warming) to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas.\n        [+N≡N]-Ar-CH2CHO + H2O -> HO-Ar-CH2CHO + N2 + H+\n\n    The product after the first two steps is 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde.\n    ```\n           OH\n           |\n          / \\\n       ==|   |==\n       | |   | |\n       ==|   |==\n          \\ /\n           |\n          CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Step 3: `aq. KOH, Heat`**\n    This step involves reacting the intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde, with a strong base (KOH) and heat. The intermediate is an aldehyde that possesses protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- protons). These conditions are classic for an **aldol condensation** reaction. Since there is only one type of aldehyde, this will be a **self-condensation**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the mechanism and product of the aldol condensation.**\n\n1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate anion.\n    `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH- <=> [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]- + H2O`\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate anion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde.\n    `[HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]- + O=CH-CH2-C6H4-OH -> product`\n\n3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to form the **aldol addition product**.\n    Let's trace the carbon backbone: C1 is the aldehyde carbon. The new bond forms between the α-carbon (C2) of the first molecule and the carbonyl carbon (which becomes C3) of the second molecule.\n    The addition product is:\n    `HO-C6H4-CH(CHO)-CH(OH)-CH2-C6H4-OH`\n    To name this, we find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (aldehyde). This is a butanal chain.\n    `CHO(C1)-CH(C2)(Ar-OH)-CH(C3)(OH)-CH2(C4)(Ar-OH)`\n    The IUPAC name is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to **option C**.\n\n4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **Heat**. This provides the energy for a subsequent elimination (dehydration) reaction. The aldol addition product loses a molecule of water to form a more stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The hydrogen on the α-carbon (C2) and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) are eliminated.\n    `3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal --(Heat, -H2O)--> Product`\n    The elimination creates a double bond between C2 and C3.\n    The structure of the final product is:\n    `CHO(C1)-C(C2)(Ar-OH)=CH(C3)-CH2(C4)(Ar-OH)`\n    The IUPAC name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to **option B**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction proceeds through an aldol addition to form the intermediate shown in option C. However, because the reaction is heated, the final, most stable product is the dehydrated condensation product. The conjugation of the newly formed C=C double bond with both the carbonyl group and one of the aromatic rings provides a significant thermodynamic driving force for this dehydration step. Therefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\n**1. Analysis of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula is C₈H₉NO.

The chemical shift suggests it's a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like the aldehyde) and an aromatic ring. The doublet splitting indicates it is coupled to a single proton, which is the aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:**\n    *   From the NMR, we can piece together the fragments: a para-disubstituted benzene ring, an -NH₂ group, and a -CH₂-CHO group.\n    *   Putting them together, we get 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula: C₆H₄ (from the ring) + NH₂ + C₂H₃O (from -CH₂CHO) = C₈H₉NO.

KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    We are now reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This aldehyde has two acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH₂- group adjacent to the carbonyl). Aldehydes with α-hydrogens undergo a base-catalyzed **aldol condensation**.\n\n    *   **a.

Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate anion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\n    *   **c.

This leaves 1 DBE, which corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O) or a C=C double bond.\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   `9.72 ppm (t, 1H)`: This chemical shift and multiplicity (triplet) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) that is adjacent to a CH2 group (n+1=3, so n=2). This confirms the presence of a `-CH2-CHO` fragment and the C=O group.\n    *   `6.98 ppm (d, 2H)` and `6.51 ppm (d, 2H)`: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicate a *para*-substituted benzene ring. The relatively upfield shifts suggest the ring is substituted with electron-donating groups.\n    *   `6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)`: A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group. An amine is an electron-donating group, consistent with the aromatic signals.\n    *   `3.66 ppm (d, 2H)`: A doublet for two protons, which corresponds to the -CH2- group coupled to the aldehyde proton (-CHO), as established from the aldehyde signal.\n\n*   **Assembling the structure:**\n    Putting all the pieces together (a *para*-substituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group), the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The formula C8H9NO matches this structure (C6H4 for the ring, NH2, and C2H3O for the side chain).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\nThe starting material is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl (diazotization)**\n    This reaction converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    The product is **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n    \n    `H2N-C6H4-CH2CHO  -- (NaNO2, HCl) -->  Cl-N2+-C6H4-CH2CHO`\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O (hydrolysis)**\n    Warming the aqueous solution of the diazonium salt causes the -N2+ group to be replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing N2 gas.\n    The product is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    \n    `Cl-N2+-C6H4-CH2CHO  -- (H2O, Heat) -->  HO-C6H4-CH2CHO + N2 + HCl`\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    The reactant for this step is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This molecule has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-aldol condensation.\n\n    *   **Step a: Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde, known as the aldol adduct.\n        \n        Aldol Adduct: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to **Option D**.\n        \n        `2 * HO-C6H4-CH2CHO --(KOH)--> HO-C6H4-CH(CHO)-CH(OH)-CH2-C6H4-OH`\n\n    *   **Step b: Dehydration:** The reaction is performed with \"Heat\". In aldol reactions, heating the aldol adduct in the presence of base causes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This is because the resulting conjugated system is thermodynamically very stable. The α-proton is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group is eliminated.\n        \n        `HO-C6H4-CH(CHO)-CH(OH)-CH2-C6H4-OH --(Heat, -H2O)--> HO-C6H4-C(CHO)=CH-CH2-C6H4-OH`\n\n        Final Product: The resulting α,β-unsaturated aldehyde is named **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to **Option B**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction proceeds through the aldol adduct (D), but because heat is applied, the final, stable product is the dehydrated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde (B). Therefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\n**1.

The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a CH2 group), according to the n+1 rule.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets integrating to 2 protons each, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2). The protons are exchangeable, leading to a broad signal.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet in the aliphatic region integrating to 2 protons. This corresponds to a CH2 group. The doublet splitting means it's adjacent to a carbon with 1 proton (a CH group), which in this case is the aldehyde's CH.\n\n*   **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and a 2-oxoethyl group (-CH2CHO).\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the structure **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**. Let's verify it matches the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n        *   C: 6 (ring) + 2 (side chain) = 8\n        *   H: 4 (ring) + 2 (NH2) + 2 (CH2) + 1 (CHO) = 9\n        *   N: 1\n        *   O: 1\n    *   The structure is consistent with the formula and all NMR signals. The -NH2 group is electron-donating, shielding the ortho protons (6.51 ppm), and the -CH2CHO group is weakly electron-withdrawing.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This reagent mixture is used for diazotization. The primary aromatic amine group (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   *Starting Material:* 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n    *   *Product after Step 1:* 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt (often with gentle warming) leads to hydrolysis. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from water.\n    *   *Intermediate Product:* 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step subjects the intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, to a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:**\n        1.  The base (OH-) removes an acidic alpha-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde (the protons on the -CH2- group) to form an enolate.\n        2.  This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule.\n        3.  After protonation, this forms an aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n    *   **Aldol Condensation (Dehydration):**\n        The \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct. The alpha-proton (on C2) and the beta-hydroxyl group (on C3) are eliminated to form a stable, conjugated C=C double bond. This process is called condensation.\n        *   Aldol Adduct: `(HO)Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(PhOH)-CHO`\n        *   Dehydration removes the H from C2 and the OH from C3.\n        *   Final Product: `(HO)Ph-CH2-CH=C(PhOH)-CHO`\n\n*   **Identify the Final Product:**\n    *   The name of the condensation product `(HO)Ph-CH2-CH=C(PhOH)-CHO` is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n    *   This matches option **A**.\n    *   Option (C) is the intermediate aldol adduct, but the inclusion of \"Heat\" indicates the reaction proceeds to the final condensation product.\n    *   Option (B) has an incorrect molecular formula.\n    *   Option (D) incorrectly has phenyl groups instead of the hydroxyphenyl groups that are formed in the second step of the reaction.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the entire reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\n**1.

The diazonium group (-N₂⁺) is an excellent leaving group, and it is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from water. Nitrogen gas (N₂) is evolved.\n    *   The product after this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**. The structure is HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This is a strong base (KOH) with heat. The reactant is an aldehyde (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) that possesses alpha-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH₂- group next to the aldehyde).\n    *   Aldehydes with alpha-hydrogens undergo a base-catalyzed **Aldol Condensation** under these conditions. This is a two-part process: an aldol addition followed by a dehydration.\n    *   **Part A: Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic alpha-hydrogen to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of another molecule of the aldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields an aldol addition product.\n        *   **Enolate formation:** [HO-C₆H₄-CH-CHO]⁻\n        *   **Nucleophilic attack:** The enolate attacks a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        *   **Addition Product:** After protonation, the product is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to **option A**.\n        \n        *Structure of the Aldol Addition Product:*\n        ```\n              OH\n              |\n        HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CH-CH(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO \n        ```\n    *   **Part B: Dehydration (Condensation):** The word \"**Heat**\" is crucial. It provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The -OH group from C-3 and the acidic alpha-hydrogen from C-2 are eliminated to form a double bond. This dehydration is highly favored because it creates a large, stable conjugated system (Aryl-C=C-C=O).\n        \n        *Structure of the Aldol Condensation Product:*\n        ```\n        HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CH=C(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO \n        ```\n        Let's name this final product: The parent chain is a four-carbon aldehyde with a double bond at C-2, so it's a **but-2-enal**. It has 4-hydroxyphenyl groups at positions C-2 and C-4. The name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to **option B**.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion.**\n\nThe sequence of reactions transforms 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-condensation under basic, heated conditions. The final stable product is the dehydrated aldol condensation product.\n\n*   Option A is the aldol *addition* product, which is an intermediate.\n*   Option B is the aldol *condensation* product, which is the final product formed with heat.\n*   Options C and D are incorrect based on the reaction mechanism and stoichiometry.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material (C8H9NO) from the NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation. This leaves one more degree of unsaturation, likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the other signals.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H-NMR signals:**\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a CH2 group), according to the n+1 rule. This suggests a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH2 group. The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it's coupled to a single adjacent proton (a CH group). This is consistent with the `-CH2-CHO` fragment, where the CH2 protons are coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets with an integration of 2H each, which is a classic pattern for a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring. The upfield chemical shifts (compared to benzene at 7.3 ppm) suggest the ring is substituted with at least one electron-donating group.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of an amine group (-NH2). The protons are exchangeable, leading to a broad signal. An amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the structure:**\n    We have a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring with an -NH2 group and a -CH2CHO (ethanal) group as the two substituents. Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (benzene ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n\n    The starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    This is a standard reaction for converting a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is transformed into a diazonium group (-N2+Cl-). The aldehyde group remains unchanged.\n    *   Product of Step 1: **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    Diazonium salts are generally unstable and, when warmed in water, undergo hydrolysis. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a common method to synthesize phenols from anilines.\n    *   Product of Step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    The product from step 2, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde that has protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- protons). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-aldol condensation.\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an alpha-proton to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion.\n        `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH- <=> [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]- + H2O`\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives the aldol addition product.\n        Addition Product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option B).\n    3.  **Dehydration:** The reaction is performed with **heat**. This provides the energy to eliminate a molecule of water from the aldol addition product. The acidic proton on the alpha-carbon (C2) is removed, and the hydroxyl group on the beta-carbon (C3) leaves, forming a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        `3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal --(Heat, -H2O)--> 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal`\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product.**\n\nThe term \"Heat\" is a key piece of information, indicating that the reaction proceeds to the final, dehydrated condensation product, not stopping at the intermediate addition product. The final product is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed after the elimination of water.\n\nThe structure of the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option D.\n\nLet's check the IUPAC name and structure for option D:\n*   Name: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**\n*   This name describes a 4-carbon chain (`but-`) with an aldehyde (`-al`) at C1 and a double bond between C2 and C3 (`-2-en`). There are 4-hydroxyphenyl substituents on C2 and C4.\n*   Structure: `(HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH=C(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)`. This structure is the result of the dehydration of the aldol addition product, as deduced above.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the entire reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is `C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1`.\n    DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DoU of 4 usually indicates a benzene ring. The remaining DoU of 1 suggests a double bond or another ring. The presence of an oxygen atom and a very downfield proton signal points towards a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), means it's coupled to an adjacent CH₂ group (according to the n+1 rule, 2 neighboring protons -> 2+1=3 peaks). This establishes a **-CH₂-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the CH₂ group. Its chemical shift is consistent with a methylene group positioned between a benzene ring and an electron-withdrawing group like an aldehyde. The splitting, a doublet (d), confirms it is coupled to a single proton (the aldehyde proton, n+1 rule, 1 neighboring proton -> 1+1=2 peaks). This further confirms the **-CH₂-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets and integrating to 2 protons each, are a classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield, suggesting the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet corresponds to two exchangeable protons. Given the presence of nitrogen in the formula, this is an **amino group (-NH₂) **. An -NH₂ group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield position of the aromatic signals.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with an -NH₂ group and a -CH₂-CHO group as substituents. The complete structure of the starting compound is **2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n\n     ![Starting Material: 2-(4-aminophenyl) acetaldehyde](https://i.imgur.com/kS9Q7x1.png)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **1. NaNO₂ + HCl (at 0-5 °C):** This set of reagents is used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH₂) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    The product after this step is 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)acetaldehyde chloride.\n\n*   **2. H₂O:** The addition of water to the diazonium salt, often with gentle heating, leads to the hydrolysis of the diazonium group. The -N₂⁺ group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N₂ gas), and it is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from the water.\n    The product after this step is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n\n     ![Intermediate: 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetaldehyde](https://i.imgur.com/gKj60lK.png)\n\n*   **3. aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves treating the intermediate with a strong base (KOH) and heat. The intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde, has an aldehyde group and acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the aldehyde (the α-carbon). These are the perfect conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH acts as a base and removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde. This forms an aldol adduct, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (which corresponds to option A).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The word \"Heat\" is crucial. It indicates that the reaction does not stop at the aldol adduct. The adduct readily dehydrates (loses a molecule of water) to form a more stable, conjugated system. The elimination involves the -OH group on the β-carbon (C3) and the acidic proton on the α-carbon (C2). This results in the formation of a double bond between the α and β carbons (a C=C double bond conjugated with the C=O bond of the aldehyde).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the final product.**\n\nThe dehydration of the aldol adduct (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal) yields an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\nThe final structure is:\n`HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CH=C(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO`\nLet's name this compound using IUPAC nomenclature:\n*   The principal functional group is the aldehyde (-CHO), so the suffix is \"-al\".\n*   The longest carbon chain containing the aldehyde and the double bond has four carbons, so it's a \"butenal\".\n*   The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it's a \"but-2-enal\".\n*   There are two 4-hydroxyphenyl substituents, one at position C2 and one at position C4.\n*   Thus, the final product name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThis name and structure match option B.\n\n ![Final Product: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) but-2-enal](https://i.imgur.com/UEx8T1R.png)\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The formula is DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DBE = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 DBE (one ring and three double bonds). This leaves one additional degree of unsaturation, which could be a C=O or C=C bond.\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Signals:**\n    *   **9.72 (t, 1H):** A signal in the 9-10 ppm range is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity (t) indicates that the adjacent carbon has two protons (n+1 rule: 2+1=3). This suggests a -CH2-CHO fragment. The single DBE is accounted for by the C=O of the aldehyde.\n    *   **3.66 (d, 2H):** A signal for two protons, appearing as a doublet (d). This means the adjacent carbon has one proton (n+1 rule: 1+1=2). This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment, as the -CH2- protons are coupled to the single -CHO proton.\n    *   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons and appearing as doublets, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for an amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring. The protons are exchangeable.\n\n*   **Assemble the Structure:**\n    We have the following fragments:\n    *   A para-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4)\n    *   An amine group (-NH2)\n    *   An ethyl-aldehyde group (-CH2CHO)\n    Assembling these gives 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal, also known as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n    Let's check the molecular formula: C6H4(ring) + C2H3O(side chain) + NH2 = C8H(4+3+2)NO = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n    The structure is:\n     \n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O, Heat**\n    This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    1.  **Diazotization:** The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl at low temperature) to form a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** Gently heating the aqueous solution of the diazonium salt causes it to decompose, with the diazonium group being replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) from water, releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n    *   **Product of this stage (Intermediate):** The starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is converted to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n     \n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This set of conditions (a base and heat) is characteristic of an aldol condensation reaction for an aldehyde that has α-hydrogens. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has two acidic α-hydrogens on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. It will undergo self-condensation.\n\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** One molecule of the aldehyde forms an enolate ion by losing an α-hydrogen to the base (KOH). This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. This forms an aldol addition product.\n        The initial product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option D).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The α-hydrogen (on C2) and the hydroxyl group (on C3) are eliminated to form a new carbon-carbon double bond. This creates a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the double bond is conjugated with both the carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Final Product Identification:**\n    Let's draw the final condensation product and name it.\n    The structure formed after dehydration is:\n     \n\n    To name this compound using IUPAC rules:\n    1.  The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (aldehyde) has four carbons. The parent name is **butanal**.\n    2.  There is a double bond between C2 and C3. The parent name becomes **but-2-enal**.\n    3.  There is a **4-hydroxyphenyl** group attached to C2.\n    4.  There is another **4-hydroxyphenyl** group attached to C4.\n    5.  Combining these gives the name: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThis name and structure perfectly match option B. Option D is the intermediate aldol adduct before the dehydration step. Since heat is applied, the reaction proceeds to the more stable condensation product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\nFirst, let's deduce the structure of the initial compound using its molecular formula and 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring. The C=O group of an aldehyde would account for this.\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which, according to the n+1 rule, means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 hydrogens (a -CH2- group). This confirms the presence of a **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde. It appears as a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton. The chemical shift is downfield, consistent with it being alpha to a carbonyl group and also attached to an aromatic ring (benzylic).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are characteristic of a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The relatively upfield chemical shifts suggest the ring has a strong electron-donating group attached.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring. The -NH2 group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield position of the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Putting the fragments together: a para-disubstituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO (acetaldehyde) group. The only way to combine these to satisfy the formula C8H9NO is to attach the -NH2 and -CH2CHO groups at the para positions (1 and 4) of the benzene ring.\n\n    Therefore, the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nNow, let's follow the starting material through the three reaction steps.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n     ![](https://i.imgur.com/G5gQy6J.png) \n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This is the standard diazotization reaction. A primary aromatic amine (Ar-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (Ar-N2+Cl-).\n    The product after this step is **4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n     ![](https://i.imgur.com/hX0YgC5.png) \n\n*   **Step 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt and warming causes the diazonium group (-N2+) to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas. This is a Sandmeyer-type reaction to produce a phenol.\n    The product after this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n     ![](https://i.imgur.com/Y1gM8vD.png) \n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This compound is an aldehyde with acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group), which are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** First, the base (OH-) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n        The product would be **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option D).\n         ![](https://i.imgur.com/gK2R83B.png) \n\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The term \"Heat\" is crucial. Heating the aldol addition product in the presence of base promotes the elimination of a molecule of water (dehydration). The acidic α-proton (on C-2) is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group (on C-3) leaves, forming a double bond between C-2 and C-3. This creates a highly stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new double bond is conjugated with both the carbonyl group and one of the aromatic rings.\n        The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n         ![](https://i.imgur.com/6D9TUnO.png) \n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction sequence converts 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. Because the reaction is heated, the final product is the dehydrated condensation product, not the simple addition product.\n\nMatching our derived final product, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal, with the given options:\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect substituents and double bond position.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure, not a dimerization product.\n*   C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** - This perfectly matches our derived final product.\n*   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which dehydrates upon heating.\n\nThus, the final product is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\n**1.

An amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield aromatic signals.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is -NH₂.\n    *   The other substituent is the -CH₂CHO fragment.\n    *   This gives the structure **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n    *   Let's verify the formula: C = 6(ring)+2(chain) = 8.

Reaction Sequence Analysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO₂ + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    *   This is a standard diazotization reaction that converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt.\n    *   The -NH₂ group is converted to -N₂⁺Cl⁻.\n    *   **Product of Step 1:** 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H₂O (Hydrolysis)**\n    *   Heating a diazonium salt in water replaces the diazonium group (-N₂⁺) with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   **Product of Step 2:** 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    *   The product from step 2, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group).\n    *   A strong base (KOH) will deprotonate the α-carbon to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. This is a self-aldol reaction.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The initial product is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n        *   Structure: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option **A**.\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. This provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the β-hydroxy aldehyde. The acidic α-proton and the β-hydroxyl group are removed, forming a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        *   The final product is formed by dehydration of the addition product.\n        *   Let R = 4-hydroxyphenyl. The reaction is:\n            R-CH₂(α)-CHO + R-CH₂(α)-CHO --(KOH, Heat)--> R-CH₂-CH=C(R)-CHO + H₂O\n        *   **Final Product Structure:** 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal. This corresponds to option **D**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for the **final product** of the reaction sequence. The presence of \"Heat\" in the final step ensures that the aldol reaction proceeds through dehydration to the more thermodynamically stable conjugated system. Therefore, the aldol condensation product, not the simple addition product, is the final answer.\n\n*   The Aldol Addition Product is **A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**.\n*   The Aldol Condensation Product (after dehydration) is **D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThe final product is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product.\n\n### **Part 1: Identify the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the structure of the initial compound using its molecular formula and 1H-NMR data.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 typically indicates the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring (e.g., C=O, C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift (9-10 ppm) is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**. The splitting is a triplet (t), which means it's adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a CH2 group), according to the n+1 rule.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a signal for 2 protons. The splitting is a doublet (d), meaning it's adjacent to a carbon with 1 proton (a CH group). This confirms the presence of a **-CH2-CHO** fragment, as the CH2 protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield (less than 7 ppm), which indicates the ring is attached to an electron-donating group (EDG).\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet corresponds to 2 exchangeable protons. Given the nitrogen in the molecular formula, this is very likely a primary **amine group (-NH2)**. An amine group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    We have the following fragments:\n    *   A -CH2-CHO group\n    *   An -NH2 group\n    *   A benzene ring to which these two groups are attached in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\n    The structure of the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n     \n\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4(NH2)(CH2CHO) -> C = 6+2 = 8; H = 4+2+2+1 = 9; N=1; O=1. Formula C8H9NO is correct.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\nNow, we subject 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde to the given series of reactions.\n\n1.  **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O**\n    *   This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    *   **Step 1 (NaNO2 + HCl at 0-5°C): Diazotization.** The primary amine group (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The intermediate is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    *   **Step 2 (H2O, heat): Hydrolysis.** The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water to replace the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas.\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n     \n\n2.  **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves reacting the intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, with a strong base (KOH) and heat.\n    *   4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde with alpha-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group). Such aldehydes undergo an **aldol condensation** reaction in the presence of base and heat.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a. **Enolate Formation:** The base (OH⁻) removes an alpha-hydrogen from one molecule to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n        b. **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        c. **Aldol Addition:** Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives the aldol addition product, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option B).\n        d. **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **heat** promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. An alpha-hydrogen and the beta-hydroxyl group are removed to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n    *   **Final Product Formation:**\n        The aldol addition product dehydrates to form a double bond between the alpha (C2) and beta (C3) carbons.\n\n         \n\n        The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n### **Part 3: Match with Options**\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents and double bond position.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure; it's not a dimerization product.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This structure matches the final product of the aldol condensation reaction.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the given molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula for a saturated acyclic amine with 8 carbons would be C8H(2*8+2+1)N = C8H19N. The given formula is C8H9NO.\n    *   Difference in hydrogens = 19 - 9 = 10 hydrogens.\n    *   The oxygen is likely in a carbonyl group (C=O), which accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Degrees of unsaturation = (10 H / 2) - 1 (for C=O) = 5 - 1 = 4. (Or use the formula: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5).\n    *   A degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests a benzene ring (4 degrees) plus one other double bond or ring (likely a carbonyl C=O).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it's coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2), suggesting a -CH₂-CHO group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This corresponds to the -CH₂- group adjacent to the aldehyde. It's a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one proton (n+1=2, so n=1), which is the aldehyde proton. The coupling between the 9.72 ppm and 3.66 ppm signals is mutually consistent.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons in this region, combined with the presence of nitrogen in the formula, is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are an amino group (-NH₂) and a phenylacetaldehyde group (-CH₂-CHO).\n    *   Putting it together gives 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   Let's check if the formula matches: C₆H₄ (ring) + NH₂ + C₂H₃O (-CH₂CHO) = C₈H₉NO. The formula is correct.\n\n**The starting material is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.**\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction.\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO₂ + HCl**\n    This mixture generates nitrous acid (HONO) in situ. This is the standard reagent for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group is converted into a diazonium salt, -N₂⁺Cl⁻.\n    The product after this step is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    `[Cl⁻][⁺N≡N]-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO`\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H₂O**\n    Reacting an aromatic diazonium salt with water (often with gentle heating) results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas (N₂). This is a standard synthesis of phenols.\n    The intermediate product is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO`\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, possesses both an aldehyde group and acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH₂- group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH removes an acidic α-hydrogen from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO + OH⁻ ⇌ [HO-C₆H₄-CH-CHO]⁻ + H₂O`\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        This forms an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The structure of this product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option B).\n        Structure: `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂(C₄)-CH(OH)(C₃)-CH(C₆H₄OH)(C₂)-CHO(C₁)`\n    3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of \"Heat\" promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) and a hydrogen from the α-carbon (C2) are removed. This dehydration is highly favorable because it creates an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new C=C double bond is conjugated with the C=O group and the aromatic ring on C2, resulting in a very stable extended conjugated system.\n        The product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n        Structure: `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂(C₄)-CH(C₃)=C(C₆H₄OH)(C₂)-CHO(C₁)`\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product among the choices.**\n\nThe question asks for the **final product** of the entire sequence. The inclusion of \"Heat\" in the last step indicates that the reaction proceeds to the dehydrated condensation product, not stopping at the addition product.\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure (lacks hydroxyl groups).\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure, would not be formed from self-condensation.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed from the complete aldol condensation (addition followed by dehydration). This matches our derived final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\n**1. Deciphering the Starting Material (C8H9NO) from NMR Data**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula is C8H9NO. The DoU is calculated as C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 5. A DoU of 5 strongly indicates the presence of a benzene ring (4 DoU) and one other double bond or ring (1 DoU). The signals in the aromatic region (6-7 ppm) confirm the benzene ring.\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons, suggesting a -CH2-CHO group.\n    *   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are in the aromatic region. This pattern is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring.\n    *   **3.66 (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons. Its chemical shift suggests it's a benzylic -CH2- group (a CH2 attached to the benzene ring). The doublet multiplicity means it is coupled to one adjacent proton. This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment, as this CH2 is coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are an amine group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2-CHO).\n    *   Let's check the formula: C6H4 (from the ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (from the side chain) = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n    *   The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The chemical shifts also align: the electron-donating -NH2 group shields the ortho protons (6.51 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing -CH2CHO group deshields its ortho protons (6.98 ppm).\n\n**2. Analyzing the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde (H2N-C6H4-CH2-CHO)\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    *   This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    *   First, the reaction with NaNO2 and HCl at low temperature (diazotization) converts the -NH2 group into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n        *   `H2N-C6H4-CH2-CHO -> [Cl-][+N2]-C6H4-CH2-CHO`\n    *   Second, warming the diazonium salt solution with water (hydrolysis) replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        *   `[+N2]-C6H4-CH2-CHO -> HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO`\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves treating the intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, with a strong base (KOH) and heat.\n    *   4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde with acidic alpha-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group).\n    *   This is the classic condition for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an alpha-proton to form an enolate ion.\n        2.  **Aldol Addition:** The nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms an aldol addition product.\n            *   Adduct: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (This corresponds to option C).\n        3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **heat** promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct. The alpha-proton is removed, and the hydroxyl group on the beta-carbon leaves. This results in the formation of a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons.\n            *   `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO -> HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO + H2O`\n            *   The formation of this α,β-unsaturated aldehyde is thermodynamically favored because the new double bond is in conjugation with both the aldehyde's carbonyl group and one of the phenyl rings, creating a large, stable conjugated system.\n\n*   **Identifying the Final Product:**\n    *   The dehydrated product is named by identifying the main chain, which is a butenal (a four-carbon aldehyde with a double bond).\n    *   The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it's a but-2-enal.\n    *   There are two 4-hydroxyphenyl groups, one on C2 and one on C4.\n    *   Therefore, the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option B. Option C is the intermediate before the final dehydration step, which occurs due to the applied heat.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material, C8H9NO, from the 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation. The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which is suggested by the NMR data.\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Signals:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** The chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH2-) according to the n+1 rule (n=2 protons).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to a single adjacent proton (n=1). This coupling pattern (-CH2-CHO) is consistent with the aldehyde proton signal. Thus, we have a -CH2-CHO fragment (an ethanal group).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons and appearing as doublets, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons in this region is typical for a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to quadrupolar coupling with nitrogen and/or chemical exchange.\n\n*   **Assemble the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO) as substituents. Putting them together gives the structure 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal, also known as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: The benzene ring is C6H4. The substituents are -NH2 and -CH2CHO. Total formula = C6H4 + NH2 + C2H3O = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO. This matches the given molecular formula.\n\n    The starting material is:\n    ```\n        NH2\n         |\n        / \\\n       || ||\n       \\\\ //\n        |\n      CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This reagent mixture is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged. The product is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    ```\n      Cl- +N2\n         |\n        / \\\n       || ||\n       \\\\ //\n        |\n      CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    Diazonium salts are unstable and, upon warming in water, undergo hydrolysis. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) from the water. This reaction converts the diazonium salt into a phenol. The product is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    ```\n        OH\n         |\n        / \\\n       || ||\n       \\\\ //\n        |\n      CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. The starting material for this step is an aldehyde with acidic protons on the alpha-carbon (the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for a self-aldol condensation reaction.\n\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes a proton from the α-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.

The proton on the α-carbon (C2) is acidic and is removed by the base, and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) is eliminated.

A triplet (t) indicates that it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1 rule), which implies a -CH2- group is next to it. So, we have a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to rapid proton exchange and quadrupolar relaxation.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH2 group. A doublet (d) indicates it's coupled to one adjacent proton, which is consistent with the aldehyde proton in the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n    *   Let's check if the formula matches: C6H4 (from the ring) + NH2 + C2H3O = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO. The formula is correct.\n    *   Therefore, the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n\n*   **Reaction 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    1.  **Diazotization:** The reagents NaNO2 and HCl at low temperature react with the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) to form a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** The addition of water (often with warming) to the diazonium salt results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a standard method to synthesize phenols.\n\n    The intermediate product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    ```\n         HO-Ph-CH2-CHO  (where Ph is a 1,4-phenylene group)\n    ```\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   We are now treating an aldehyde (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) that possesses α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group) with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate ion.\n        b.  **Nucleophilic Attack (Aldol Addition):** The enolate ion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product.\n            The structure of the aldol addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n            ```\n                                    CHO\n                                    |\n            HO-Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH-Ph-OH\n            ```\n        c.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **heat** promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. This dehydration step is called condensation.\n\n    The formation of the C=C double bond creates a conjugated system (α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which is thermodynamically stable and favored by heat.\n    The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to option (D).\n    ```\n                           CHO\n                           |\n       HO-Ph-CH2-CH=C-Ph-OH\n    ```\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for the **final product** of the entire reaction sequence. While the aldol addition product (C) is a key intermediate, the \"Heat\" condition in the final step drives the reaction forward to the dehydrated condensation product (D). Therefore, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal is the final major product.\n\nFinal Answer Comparison:\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect functional groups and structure.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure, only one aromatic ring.\n*   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol *addition* product, which is an intermediate.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the aldol *condensation* product, the final product formed upon heating.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO).**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 = 8 - 9/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR spectrum:**\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are characteristic of a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** The broad singlet for two protons is indicative of an exchangeable group like -OH or -NH2. Given the presence of nitrogen in the molecular formula (C8H9**N**O), this signal corresponds to a primary amino group (-NH2).\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** This signal far downfield is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity (t) indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-) according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet multiplicity (d) indicates it is adjacent to a single proton (n+1 rule, 1+1=2 peaks), which confirms it's coupled to the aldehyde proton. Thus, we have a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n\n*   **Assemble the structure:**\n    We have the following fragments: a para-disubstituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group. Assembling these gives **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify the formula: C6H4 (ring) + C (from CH2) + C (from CHO) + NH2 + H (from CH2) + H (from CHO) gives C8H9NO. The structure is consistent with all data.\n\n    Startiing Material:\n    ```\n        NH2\n         |\n        / \\\n      ||   ||\n      \\\\   //\n         |\n        CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **1. NaNO2 + HCl (0-5 °C):** This is a standard diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+ Cl-).\n    The product is 4-(diazoniophenyl)acetaldehyde chloride.\n    ```\n      [N≡N]+ Cl-\n         |\n        / \\\n      ||   ||\n      \\\\   //\n         |\n        CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **2. H2O, Heat:** The diazonium salt is treated with water and heated. This causes hydrolysis of the diazonium salt, where the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). Nitrogen gas (N2) is evolved.\n    The product is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    ```\n        OH\n         |\n        / \\\n      ||   ||\n      \\\\   //\n         |\n        CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **3. aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves reacting an aldehyde with alpha-hydrogens (the CH2 group is alpha to the CHO group) with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This is a classic self-aldol condensation reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the product of the aldol condensation.**\n\nThe reaction happens between two molecules of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Let's denote Ar = 4-hydroxyphenyl. The reactant is Ar-CH2-CHO.\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule to form an enolate (`[Ar-CH-CHO]-`). This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, the aldol addition product.\n    *   Aldol Adduct: `Ar-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ar)-CHO`\n    *   The IUPAC name is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option **D**.\n\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is carried out with \"Heat\". This provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product to form a more stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The alpha-proton (on C2) and the beta-hydroxyl group (on C3) are removed.\n    *   `Ar-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ar)-CHO` --(Heat, -H2O)--> `Ar-CH2-CH=C(Ar)-CHO`\n    *   Let's name this final condensation product. The main chain is a `but-2-enal`. There is a `4-hydroxyphenyl` group at position 2 and another at position 4.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to option **B**.\n\nSince the reaction conditions include heat, the reaction will not stop at the aldol addition stage (product D) but will proceed to the more thermodynamically stable condensation product (product B), which benefits from extended conjugation between the phenyl ring, the C=C double bond, and the C=O double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product of the entire reaction sequence is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the given NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1. For C8H9NO, DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5. A DoU of 5 suggests a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This high chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which, according to the n+1 rule, means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a -CH2- group). This confirms the presence of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.0 ppm) are both doublets and each integrates to 2 protons. This pattern is a classic indicator of a 1,4- or para-disubstituted benzene ring. The relatively upfield shifts (especially 6.51 ppm) suggest the presence of a strong electron-donating group (EDG) on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons is typical for an amino group (-NH2) or a hydroxyl group (-OH). Given the nitrogen in the molecular formula, this is an amino group (-NH2), which is a strong EDG.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet corresponds to the -CH2- group we inferred from the aldehyde signal. The doublet multiplicity confirms it is adjacent to a carbon with one proton (the -CH- of the aldehyde). The coupling between the 9.72 ppm proton (triplet) and the 3.66 ppm protons (doublet) confirms the -CH2-CHO moiety.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent is an acetaldehyde group (-CH2-CHO).\n    *   Putting it together gives **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) = C8H9NO. This matches perfectly.\n    *   The NMR is also consistent: The electron-donating -NH2 group shields the ortho protons (6.51 ppm), while the protons ortho to the -CH2CHO group are less shielded (6.98 ppm).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    1.  **NaNO2 + HCl:** These are the reagents for **diazotization**. They convert a primary aromatic amine (Ar-NH2) into a diazonium salt (Ar-N₂⁺Cl⁻) at low temperatures (typically 0-5°C). The aldehyde group remains unaffected.\n        *   Product: 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    2.  **H2O (with warming):** Adding water and warming the diazonium salt solution causes **hydrolysis**, replacing the diazonium group (-N₂⁺) with a hydroxyl group (-OH). Nitrogen gas (N₂) is liberated.\n        *   Product after steps 1 & 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has acidic α-protons (on the -CH2- group), which is the requirement for an **aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH removes an α-proton from one molecule to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n        2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.

This structure corresponds to **Option D**.\n        3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **heat** is crucial. It promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct to form a more stable, conjugated product. The α-proton (at C2) is acidic and is removed by the base, and the hydroxyl group at C3 is eliminated. This forms a double bond between C2 and C3.\n            *   (HO-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO  -- (Heat, -H₂O) →  (HO-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=C(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO\n    *   **Final Product Identification:**\n        *   The structure is (HO-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=C(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO.\n        *   Let's name this compound based on IUPAC rules: The main chain is a butenal (4 carbons with an aldehyde and a double bond). Numbering starts from the aldehyde carbon (C1). The double bond is between C2 and C3 (but-2-enal). There are two 4-hydroxyphenyl substituents, one at C2 and one at C4.\n        *   The correct name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n        *   This name and structure correspond exactly to **Option C**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction sequence starts with 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, which is converted to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This intermediate then undergoes a base-catalyzed self-aldol condensation. Due to the \"Heat\" condition, the reaction proceeds past the initial aldol addition product (Option D) to the final, dehydrated, and highly conjugated condensation product (Option C).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\n**1.

The broadness is due to quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom and/or chemical exchange.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons. This corresponds to the -CH2- group we inferred from the aldehyde signal. The doublet splitting confirms it is coupled to a single proton (the -CHO proton). The chemical shift is consistent with a methylene group attached to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.\n\n    3.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n        We have the following fragments: a para-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4), an amine group (-NH2), and an ethanal group (-CH2CHO).\n        Assembling these pieces gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde** (also named (4-aminophenyl)ethanal).\n        Let's verify this structure:\n        *   Molecular formula: C8H9NO (C6H4 + CH2 + CHO + NH2 = C8H9NO). Correct.\n        *   DoU: Benzene ring (4) + carbonyl C=O (1) = 5. Correct.\n        *   NMR consistency: The activating -NH2 group pushes the ortho protons upfield (6.51 ppm), while the deactivating -CH2CHO group shifts its ortho protons downfield (6.98 ppm). The splitting patterns of the -CH2CHO group (triplet for CHO, doublet for CH2) are also consistent.\n        *   The starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n    1.  **NaNO2 + HCl:** This is a diazotization reaction. It converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n        *   Starting Material: 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n        *   Product after step 1: 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride\n\n    2.  **H2O:** The diazonium salt is then treated with water. Warming an aqueous solution of a diazonium salt leads to hydrolysis, where the -N2+ group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas.\n        *   Product after step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**\n\n    3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. The starting molecule has an aldehyde group and acidic α-hydrogens (on the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction. Since there is only one type of molecule, this will be a self-condensation.\n        *   **Mechanism:**\n            a.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n            b.  **Nucleophilic Attack (Addition):** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n            c.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated, yielding a β-hydroxy aldehyde, the aldol addition product.\n                The structure of the aldol addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (B).\n            d.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. The heat provides the energy to eliminate a molecule of water from the aldol addition product. The elimination is strongly favored because it creates a new C=C double bond that is conjugated with the aldehyde's carbonyl group and a phenyl ring, resulting in a very stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde system. The H is removed from the α-carbon (C2) and the OH from the β-carbon (C3).\n\n        *   **Final Product Identification:**\n            *   Aldol addition product (from b,c): 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (This is structure B)\n            *   Dehydration product (from d): **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** (This is structure C)\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclusion.**\n\n    The question asks for the final product of the reaction sequence, which includes heat in the last step. The heat drives the reaction to completion, favoring the formation of the more stable, dehydrated aldol condensation product over the simple addition product. Therefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n    Comparing this to the options:\n    A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect, missing the hydroxyl groups.\n    B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final condensation product formed under heat.\n    C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the correct α,β-unsaturated final product from the aldol condensation.\n    D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure; it's not a dimerization product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

    "Here is a detailed analysis of the reasoning provided, leading to the most consistent answer.\n\n**1. Structure of the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula & DBE:** The molecular formula is C8H9NO, which gives a Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) of 5. This is highly indicative of a benzene ring (4 DBE) and one additional double bond (1 DBE).\n*   **NMR Analysis:** All provided solutions correctly and consistently interpret the ¹H-NMR data:\n    *   The signals at `δ 9.72 (t, 1H)` and `δ 3.66 (d, 2H)` unambiguously identify a `-CH2-CHO` (acetaldehyde) fragment. The C=O bond of the aldehyde accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The pair of doublets at `δ 6.98 (2H)` and `δ 6.51 (2H)` is a classic pattern for a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   The broad singlet at `δ 6.27 (2H)` is characteristic of a primary amine group (`-NH2`), consistent with the nitrogen in the formula.\n*   **Conclusion:** There is universal agreement across all analyses that the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    *   There is unanimous agreement that this is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine to a phenol. Step 1 is diazotization (`-NH2` -> `-N2+`), and Step 2 is hydrolysis (`-N2+` -> `-OH`).\n    *   All analyses correctly conclude that the starting material is converted into the intermediate **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde with acidic alpha-protons (on the -CH2- group). All solutions correctly identify that treating this molecule with a strong base (KOH) and heat will result in an **Aldol Condensation**.\n    *   The key point of discussion, correctly addressed by the vast majority of the solutions, is the meaning of \"condensation\" versus \"addition\" and the role of \"Heat\".\n        1.  **Aldol Addition:** This is the initial step where two aldehyde molecules combine to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The structure of this addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (D).\n        2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The specified condition \"Heat\" is crucial. It provides the thermodynamic driving force for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. This dehydration step forms a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, which benefits from extended conjugation.\n    *   **Final Product:** The overwhelming consensus from the chemical reasoning presented is that the reaction will not stop at the addition stage (D) but will proceed to the final, dehydrated condensation product due to the heat. The structure of this final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**, which corresponds to option (C).\n\n**3. Evaluation of Candidate Answers & Consistency**\n\nThe vast majority of the provided reasoning sections correctly identify `2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal` (Option C) as the final product. While there are numerous inconsistencies in how the candidates map their derived answers to the letters A, B, C, or D (suggesting the options may have been shuffled in different contexts), the underlying chemical logic is sound and highly consistent. The most complete and logically sound answers explicitly state that the heat drives the reaction past the intermediate (D) to the final product (C).\n\nFor example, Answer 58 correctly identifies the starting material, follows the reaction to the intermediate `4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde`, explains the aldol reaction, explicitly identifies structure D as the *intermediate* addition product and structure C as the *final* condensation product favored by heat, and then correctly concludes C is the answer.\n\nBased on the overwhelmingly consistent chemical reasoning, the final product is the dehydrated condensation product.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is converted to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This intermediate then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. The \"Heat\" condition drives the reaction to completion, favoring the elimination of water from the initial aldol adduct. Therefore, the final, most stable product is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n<<<C>>>"

Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nFirst, we need to deduce the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO from its 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5. A DoU of 4 is typical for a benzene ring, and the remaining 1 corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (1 proton sees 2 adjacent protons, 2+1=3, a triplet).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of an amino group (-NH2). The broadness is due to rapid proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) splitting means it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-), which is consistent with it being coupled to the aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n    *   Let's check if the structure, 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal (or 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde), matches the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n        *   Benzene ring (C6H4) + Amino group (NH2) + Acetaldehyde group (C2H3O) = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO.\n    *   The structure is consistent with all the data.\n\n    The starting material is:\n    ```\n        O=CH-CH2-Ph-NH2 (para-substituted)\n    ```\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nNow, we trace the starting material through the given series of reactions.\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    *   These reagents are used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The reaction is typically carried out at low temperatures (0-5 °C).\n    *   The primary amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   The product of this step is 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O**\n    *   Adding water to the diazonium salt solution and warming it up results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a standard method to synthesize phenols from anilines.\n    *   The product of this step is 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal (or 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n    ```\n        O=CH-CH2-Ph-OH (para-substituted)\n    ```\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves reacting the product from step 2, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, with a strong base (KOH) and heat.\n    *   4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde that has protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- protons).\n    *   Aldehydes with α-hydrogens undergo a base-catalyzed aldol condensation. Since there is only one type of aldehyde, this will be a self-condensation.\n    *   The reaction proceeds in two stages:\n        1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton from one aldehyde molecule to form an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n            The structure of the aldol addition product is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (C).\n        2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction mixture is heated. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the aldol addition product. The α-proton and the β-hydroxyl group are removed, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. This results in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n            The formation of the conjugated system (C=C double bond conjugated with both a phenyl ring and the carbonyl group) makes this dehydration step thermodynamically favorable.\n\n    Let's determine the structure of the final condensation product:\n    *   Aldol addition product: `(HO-Ph)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ph-OH)-CHO`\n    *   Dehydration removes the -OH from C3 and an -H from C2:\n    *   Final Product: `(HO-Ph)-CH2-CH=C(Ph-OH)-CHO`\n    *   The systematic name for this structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3.

The triplet (t) indicates it's adjacent to a CH₂ group (n+1 rule, 2+1=3 peaks). So, we have a -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This corresponds to the CH₂ group adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet (d) is due to coupling with the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2 peaks). This confirms the -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets with an integration of 2H, are classic for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons in this region is typical for a primary amine (-NH₂).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have three fragments:\n    1.

The -NH₂ and -CH₂CHO groups are at positions 1 and 4 of the benzene ring. The chemical shifts support this: the electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its ortho protons (making them appear at a lower ppm, 6.51 ppm), while the protons ortho to the -CH₂CHO group are less shielded (higher ppm, 6.98 ppm).\n\n    **Starting Material (A):** 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n     \n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Reaction 1 & 2: NaNO₂ + HCl, followed by H₂O.**\n    1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl (0-5 °C):** These are the reagents for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine.

This corresponds to option (B).\n        4.  **Dehydration:** The condition \"Heat\" strongly favors the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group at C-3 and the acidic proton at C-2 are removed, forming a double bond between C-2 and C-3. This dehydration step is called condensation. The product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, which is stabilized by conjugation between the new C=C double bond, the C=O group, and one of the phenyl rings.\n\n    **Final Product (D):** The final product is the result of this dehydration.\n    The structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n     \n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This name perfectly matches the structure of our derived final product from the aldol condensation.\n*   B) **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal:** This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which would dehydrate upon heating.\n*   C) **2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal:** This molecule lacks the hydroxyl groups on the phenyl rings.\n*   D) **4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal:** This molecule is not a dimer; it results from a different reaction pathway.\n\nGiven the reaction conditions, especially the application of heat, the condensation product is the expected final product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBE) and one additional degree of unsaturation (a C=C or C=O double bond, or another ring).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO).

Its chemical shift is typical for protons on a carbon adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like an aldehyde or an aromatic ring). The splitting, a doublet (d), indicates it's adjacent to a carbon with 1 proton (a CH group). This is consistent with the aldehyde proton, confirming the `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets, each integrating to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring (an aniline derivative).

NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    1.  The first reagent, `NaNO2 + HCl` (at low temperature, which is implied), is used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt, -N2+Cl-.\n        The intermediate is 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    2.  The second reagent, `H2O` (with warming), reacts with the diazonium salt to replace the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas. This is a **hydrolysis** reaction.\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    1.  The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde that has acidic protons on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon).\n    2.  Aqueous KOH is a strong base, and when combined with an aldehyde possessing α-hydrogens, it catalyzes an **aldol reaction**. Since two molecules of the same aldehyde are reacting, it is a **self-aldol condensation**.\n    3.

The -OH group from C3 and the acidic α-proton from C2 are removed, forming a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde (the double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Final Product Structure:**\n    The dehydration product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents and double bond position.\nB) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This perfectly matches our derived final product.\nC) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heating conditions.\nD) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure, resulting from a different reaction.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation. The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which is consistent with the NMR data.\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it is coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde. It appears as a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2 peaks).

The electron-donating nature of the -NH2 group also explains why the aromatic protons are shifted upfield (to lower ppm values) compared to benzene (7.34 ppm).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Putting the fragments together: a p-substituted aminobenzene ring and a -CH2-CHO group. The only way to connect them to match the formula C8H9NO is to attach the -CH2-CHO group to the benzene ring at the position para to the amino group.\n\n    The starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This set of reagents is used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-). The product of this step is 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    *Structure after step 1:* [Cl-][+N≡N]–C6H4–CH2–CHO\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to a diazonium salt solution and warming it causes hydrolysis. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH).

These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction. The reaction proceeds in two stages:\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives the aldol addition product.\n        *   Aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option D).\n    2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. This provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The β-hydroxyl group and the α-hydrogen are removed to form a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The conjugation of the new C=C double bond with the C=O group (and also with one of the aromatic rings) makes this dehydration step thermodynamically favorable.\n\nLet's trace the formation of the final condensation product:\n*   Aldol addition product (structure D):\n    HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO\n    (Numbering from the aldehyde: C4-C3-C2-C1)\n*   Dehydration involves removing the -OH from C3 (the β-carbon) and the -H from C2 (the α-carbon).\n*   Final condensation product:\n    HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO\n    The IUPAC name for this structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe overall transformation is:\n4-aminophenylacetaldehyde → 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde → 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\nSince the question asks for the final product and the last step involves heating, the dehydrated condensation product (A) is the expected final product, not the intermediate aldol addition product (D).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n**1.

This forms an aldol addition product, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option B).\n    3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily eliminates a molecule of water.

The doublet (d) multiplicity means it is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment, as this CH2 group is coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n        *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The relatively upfield chemical shifts (compared to benzene at 7.26 ppm) suggest the ring has an electron-donating substituent.\n        *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of an amine group (-NH2). The broadness is due to rapid proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom. An -NH2 group is a strong electron-donating group, consistent with the upfield aromatic signals.\n\n    *   **Assemble the structure:**\n        *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n        *   Let's check if the molecular formula matches: C6H4 (from the ring) + C2H3O (from -CH2CHO) + NH2 (from the amine) = C8H(4+3+2)NO = C8H9NO. This matches.\n        *   The C=O bond of the aldehyde accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n        *   Therefore, the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n    *   **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O.**\n        *   The reaction of a primary aromatic amine (like the one in our starting material) with NaNO2 and a strong acid (HCl) at low temperatures (0-5 °C, which is standard for this reaction) is a **diazotization reaction**. It converts the amino group (-NH2) into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n        *   The subsequent addition of water (H2O), usually with gentle warming, causes the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas), and it is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) from the water.\n        *   So, this two-step process effectively converts the -NH2 group on the benzene ring to an -OH group.\n        *   Product after step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    *   **Reagent 3: aq.

The structure is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option A).\n            4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. Heating an aldol addition product in the presence of base (or acid) causes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The hydroxyl group at the β-position (C3) and a proton from the α-position (C2) are eliminated.\n                *   Addition Product: `HO-Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(PhOH)-CHO`\n                *   Elimination of H2O yields: `HO-Ph-CH2-CH=C(PhOH)-CHO`\n            5.  **Final Product Structure and Name:** The final dehydrated product has a but-2-enal chain with 4-hydroxyphenyl groups at positions 2 and 4.

In this case, the addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option A).\n\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The term \"condensation\" implies the loss of a small molecule, in this case, water. The presence of **heat** strongly favors the dehydration of the initial aldol adduct. A proton is removed from the α-carbon (C2), and the hydroxyl group is eliminated from the β-carbon (C3). This elimination forms a double bond between C2 and C3, resulting in a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The conjugation of the newly formed C=C bond with the C=O group and the adjacent aromatic ring makes this product thermodynamically favored.\n\n    The final product is the dehydrated condensation product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n    Let's trace the formation:\n    1.  **Aldol Adduct (matches Option A):**\n         \n    2.  **Dehydration under heat:**\n         \n    3.  **Final Product (matches Option B):**\n         \n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction sequence converts 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This intermediate then undergoes a self-aldol condensation.

Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group. Its broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and exchange with trace amounts of water.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent is an acetaldehyde group (-CH2-CHO).\n    *   Putting it all together, the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (side chain) + NH2 = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    *   These reagents are used to convert a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The reaction is typically carried out at low temperatures (0-5 °C).\n    *   The amino group (-NH2) on the 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted to a diazonium chloride group (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   The product is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    *   Adding water to the diazonium salt and warming the mixture causes the diazonium group to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction, releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n    *   The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    *   This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an aldol condensation.\n    *   The reactant, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group between the ring and the aldehyde). It can therefore act as both the nucleophile (after deprotonation to form an enolate) and the electrophile. This will result in a self-aldol condensation.\n\n**3. Mechanism of the Aldol Condensation**\n\n*   **a) Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH-  ⇌  [HO-C6H4-CH(-)-CHO] + H2O`\n\n*   **b) Nucleophilic Attack (Aldol Addition):** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    `[Enolate] + HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO  →  Alkoxide intermediate`\n\n*   **c) Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to give the aldol addition product.\n    `Aldol Addition Product: HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO`\n    The systematic name of this product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n*   **d) Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**, which promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The acidic proton on C2 (alpha to the carbonyl) and the hydroxyl group on C3 are eliminated.\n    `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO  --Heat-->  HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO + H2O`\n\n*   **Final Product Identification:** The final product is `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO`. Let's name this compound:\n    *   The main chain contains the aldehyde and the double bond. It is four carbons long: `C4-C3=C2-C1`.\n    *   The parent name is **but-2-enal**.\n    *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group on carbon 2.\n    *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group on carbon 4.\n    *   The full name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThis name matches option (A). Because the reaction is heated, the condensation (dehydration) product is expected to be the final major product, not the initial addition product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n*   **Step-by-step Derivations:**\n\n    1.  **Structure Elucidation of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\n        *   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n            DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n            A DBE of 5 typically indicates a benzene ring (DBE=4) and one additional double bond or ring (DBE=1).\n\n        *   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Data:**\n            *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift (>9.5 ppm) is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), as per the n+1 rule (n=2 protons). This confirms the fragment **-CH2-CHO**. The DBE of 1 is accounted for by the C=O bond.\n            *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring. A 1,4-disubstituted pattern often gives two doublets, each integrating to two protons.\n            *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to 2H is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH2). The broadness is due to rapid proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n            *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a single proton (n=1), which is the aldehyde proton from our earlier analysis. This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment. The chemical shift is consistent with a benzylic CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl.\n\n        *   **Assemble the Structure:**\n            We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2-CHO group. Assembling these gives **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (side chain) + NH2 (amine) = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n    2.  **Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n        *   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n        *   **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O**\n            This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n            1.  **Diazotization:** The primary amine (-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl) to form a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). The aldehyde group remains unchanged. The intermediate is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n            2.  **Hydrolysis:** Gently warming the aqueous solution of the diazonium salt causes it to decompose, replacing the -N2+ group with an -OH group and releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n            The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n        *   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n            This step involves reacting an aldehyde (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) that has α-protons with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**. The reaction is a self-condensation since only one type of aldehyde is present.\n\n            *   **Step A: Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n                The product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n            *   **Step B: Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. The heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The acidic α-proton (on C2) is removed, and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) leaves, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. This dehydration is highly favorable because it creates a conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which is thermodynamically very stable.\n                The final condensation product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n    3.  **Identify the Final Product**\n\n        *   The question asks for the final product after all three reaction steps, including heat. The presence of \"Heat\" in the last step signifies that the reaction proceeds to the more stable condensation product, not stopping at the addition stage.\n        *   The structure of 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal matches option (A).\n        *   Option (B) is incorrect as it results from a different pathway and has only one phenyl ring.\n        *   Option (C) is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n        *   Option (D) is incorrect as it lacks the hydroxyl groups that are introduced in the second step of the reaction sequence.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** The final product is the result of the aldol condensation, which is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the initial compound (C8H9NO) from the 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is (2*8 + 2 + 1 - 9)/2 = 5. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation, and a carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for one, which fits.\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a -CH2- group), according to the n+1 rule.\n    *   **3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal for two protons is a doublet (d), indicating it is coupled to one adjacent proton (the aldehyde -CHO proton). The chemical shift is appropriate for a methylene group alpha to both an aldehyde and a benzene ring. This confirms the presence of a **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The relatively upfield chemical shifts (normal aromatic protons are ~7.2 ppm) suggest the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons in this region is highly indicative of a primary amine group (**-NH2**) attached to the aromatic ring. Aniline derivatives often show such signals. The -NH2 group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are an -NH2 group and a -CH2-CHO group.\n    *   Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n    *   Therefore, the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    *   This is the standard procedure for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt, -N2+Cl-.\n    *   The product of this step is 4-(diazonium)phenylacetaldehyde chloride.\n*   **Reagent 2: H2O, Heat**\n    *   Treating an aromatic diazonium salt with water and heat results in the replacement of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The starting material for this step is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This molecule contains both an aldehyde group and acidic alpha-protons (on the -CH2- group).\n    *   The conditions (a strong base like KOH and heat) are classic for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic alpha-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        3.  **Protonation:** An intermediate alkoxide is protonated (by water) to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product. The structure of this intermediate is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option B).\n        4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The acidic proton on the alpha-carbon (C2) is removed, and the hydroxyl group on the beta-carbon (C3) is eliminated. This forms a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n\n*   Let's determine the structure of the final dehydrated product.\n*   The aldol addition product is:\n    `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4-OH)-CHO`\n*   Elimination of water (H from C2 and OH from C3) gives a double bond between C2 and C3:\n    `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4-OH)-CHO`\n*   Let's name this final product based on IUPAC rules:\n    *   The main chain is a butenal (4 carbons, aldehyde, C=C double bond).\n    *   The aldehyde is C1. The double bond starts at C2, so it is a **but-2-enal**.\n    *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group on C2.\n    *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group on C4.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThis name and structure match option D. The presence of \"Heat\" in the final step is a key indicator that the reaction proceeds to the final condensation product rather than stopping at the aldol addition product (Option B).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula (C8H9NO) and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n    1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n        DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n        A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., a C=O or C=C bond).\n\n    2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR spectrum:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** The chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons, likely a CH2 group. This suggests a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for an amino group (-NH2) attached to an aromatic ring. The nitrogen atom in the molecular formula supports this.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH2 group. The splitting, a doublet (d), indicates it is coupled to one proton, which is the aldehyde proton. This confirms the `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n\n    3.  **Assemble the structure:**\n        We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n        The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n        Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2CHO = C8H(4+2+2+1)NO = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula. The DBE is 4 (ring) + 1 (C=O) = 5, which is also correct.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n    *   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n        This is a standard diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n        Starting material: 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n        Product after step 1: 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride. The structure has a `[N≡N]+Cl-` group in place of the `NH2` group.\n\n    *   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n        Adding water to the diazonium salt (usually with warming) causes hydrolysis. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        Intermediate: 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride\n        Product after step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    *   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n        This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde with two acidic α-hydrogens (on the CH2 group). This is a classic setup for an **aldol condensation**.\n\n        *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-hydrogen from one aldehyde molecule to form an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product.\n            Let R = 4-hydroxyphenyl (HO-C6H4-). The starting aldehyde is R-CH2-CHO.\n            The aldol addition product is `R-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(R)-CHO`, which is named **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option D).\n\n        *   **Condensation (Dehydration):** The term \"Heat\" indicates that the reaction will likely not stop at the aldol addition product. The β-hydroxy aldehyde will undergo dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated product. The -OH group from C3 and the acidic H from C2 (alpha to the carbonyl) are eliminated.\n            `R-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(R)-CHO` --(Heat, -H2O)--> `R-CH2-CH=C(R)-CHO`\n            The product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the final product structure and match it with the options.**\n\n    *   The structure of the final condensation product is `(HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO`.\n    *   Let's name this structure according to IUPAC rules:\n        - The main chain is a butenal (4 carbons with a C=C and a C=O).\n        - The aldehyde is C1, so the double bond is between C2 and C3. It is a **but-2-enal**.\n        - There is a 4-hydroxyphenyl group on C2.\n        - There is a 4-hydroxyphenyl group on C4.\n        - The full name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n    *   This name and structure perfectly match **Option A**.\n\n    *   **Why not D?** Option D, `3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal`, is the aldol *addition* product. The presence of \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions strongly favors the subsequent dehydration to form the more thermodynamically stable conjugated system (the aldol *condensation* product). Therefore, A is the final product, not D.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material (C8H9NO) from the 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The formula for DoU is: C + 1 - H/2 + N/2\n    *   DoU = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond or ring. The C=O bond of an aldehyde would account for this.\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR signals:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift (> 9 ppm) is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1 rule: 2+1=3), indicating a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group. The chemical shift is consistent with a methylene group attached to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group. The splitting is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to one adjacent proton (1+1=2), which is the aldehyde proton. This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons in this region is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring. The broadness is due to rapid proton exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n\n*   **Assemble the structure:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an ethanal group (-CH2CHO).\n    *   Putting these together gives the structure: **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (ethanal part) + NH2 = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n\n**Step 2: Follow the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n    ```\n        H2N-Ph-CH2-CHO  (where Ph is a 1,4-phenylene ring)\n    ```\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl (at 0-5 °C)**\n    *   This is a classic **diazotization reaction**. It converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt.\n    *   The -NH2 group is converted to -N₂⁺Cl⁻.\n    *   **Intermediate A:** 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride\n    ```\n        [Cl⁻][⁺N≡N]-Ph-CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H2O, Heat**\n    *   This reaction is the **hydrolysis of a diazonium salt**. When the aqueous solution of the diazonium salt is warmed, the diazonium group (-N₂⁺) is an excellent leaving group and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) from water. Nitrogen gas (N₂) is evolved.\n    *   **Intermediate B:** 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal (also known as 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde)\n    ```\n        HO-Ph-CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq.

These are the conditions for an **aldol condensation**. Since only one type of aldehyde is present, it will be a self-condensation.\n\n    *   **a) Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-hydrogen to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives the aldol addition product.\n        *   **Aldol Adduct:** 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (C).\n        ```\n                  OH\n                  |\n           HO-Ph-CH(CHO)-CH-CH2-Ph-OH\n        ```\n        *(This is the structure of option C)*\n\n    *   **b) Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**.

This corresponds to option (B).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe question asks for the **final product** of the entire reaction sequence. The inclusion of \"Heat\" in the final step indicates that the reaction proceeds to the thermodynamically more stable condensation product, not stopping at the aldol addition stage. Therefore, the final product is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed after dehydration.\n\n*   Starting Material: 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n*   After Diazotization/Hydrolysis: 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal\n*   After Aldol Condensation (with heat): **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\n*   **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting material, C8H9NO, from its 1H-NMR data.**\n\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula is C8H9NO. The DoU is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5. A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring. The remaining DoU of 1 suggests a double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C) or another ring.\n    *   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a CH2 group), according to the n+1 rule.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the two protons on the CH2 group adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet (d) multiplicity is consistent with coupling to the single aldehyde proton. This confirms the presence of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both appearing as doublets and integrating to 2 protons each, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The relatively upfield chemical shifts (typically 7.0-7.5 for benzene) suggest the ring is substituted with at least one strong electron-donating group.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is often due to an exchangeable group like -OH or -NH2. Since the molecular formula contains nitrogen, this is assigned to a primary amine group (-NH2). An amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:**\n        *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and a -CH2-CHO group.\n        *   The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n        *   Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 (amine) + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n\n*   **Step 2: Follow the reaction sequence.**\n\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n    *   **Reaction 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O.**\n        1.  **NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization):** This set of reagents converts a primary aromatic amine (Ar-NH2) into a diazonium salt (Ar-N2+Cl-). This reaction is typically performed at low temperatures (0-5 °C). The aldehyde group remains unaffected.\n            *   Intermediate: 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n        2.  **H2O (Hydrolysis):** Gently warming the aqueous solution of the diazonium salt causes the diazonium group to be replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n            *   Product of this step: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    *   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat.**\n        *   **Reagent and Substrate:** We are treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This aldehyde has acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- protons).\n        *   **Reaction Type:** These conditions are classic for an **aldol condensation**. The reaction involves two key steps: aldol addition and subsequent dehydration.\n        1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate ion. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n            *   Addition Product: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. (This matches option B).\n        2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions strongly suggests that the aldol addition product will undergo dehydration. The base facilitates the elimination of a water molecule (the -OH from the beta-carbon and a proton from the alpha-carbon) to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n            *   Final Product: The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal results in the formation of a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons.\n            *   The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure and atom count.\n    *   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, but the reaction is heated, which drives the dehydration to completion.\n    *   C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final, dehydrated aldol condensation product. Its formation is favored by the heat, which creates a stable conjugated system.\n    *   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure; it lacks the hydroxyl groups formed in the second step of the reaction sequence.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\n*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the NMR data.**\n\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula is C8H9NO. The DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5. A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (DoU=4) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n\n    *   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO).

An amine group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield aromatic signals.\n        *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a methine group (-CH-), (1 proton on the adjacent carbon, so 1+1=2 peaks).\n\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:**\n        1.  We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        2.  One substituent is an amino group (-NH2).\n        3.  The other substituent must account for the remaining atoms: C2H3O. This corresponds to a `-CH2-CHO` group (an acetaldehyde group).\n        4.  Let's assemble these fragments: `H2N - C6H4 - CH2 - CHO`. The amino group is at one end of the para-substituted ring, and the `-CH2-CHO` group is at the other.\n        5.  Let's verify the NMR couplings with this structure: `p-H2N-C6H4-CH2-CHO`.\n            *   The aldehyde proton (-CHO) is adjacent to the -CH2- group, so it should be a triplet. This matches the signal at 9.72 ppm.\n            *   The methylene protons (-CH2-) are adjacent to the aldehyde -CH, so they should be a doublet. This matches the signal at 3.66 ppm.\n            *   The structure is consistent with all the data.\n        6.  The starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n    *   **Reagents 1 & 2: 1.

The substrate is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which is an aldehyde with two acidic α-hydrogens (the hydrogens on the -CH2- group).\n        *   This is a classic setup for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n        *   **Mechanism:**\n            1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate ion.\n            2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate ion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n            3.  **Protonation:** An intermediate alkoxide is formed, which is protonated by water to give an aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option D).\n            4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. This provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The α-hydrogen and the β-hydroxyl group are eliminated to form a double bond between the α and β carbons. This dehydration is driven by the formation of a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n            \n            *   Aldol addition product: `HO-C6H4-CH(CHO)-CH(OH)-CH2-C6H4-OH`\n            *   Dehydration removes the -OH from C3 and an -H from C2.\n            *   Final Condensation Product: `HO-C6H4-C(CHO)=CH-CH2-C6H4-OH`\n\n    *   **Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n\n        *   The structure formed after dehydration is named as follows:\n            *   The main chain is a butenal (a four-carbon chain with an aldehyde and a double bond).\n            *   The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it's a but-2-enal.\n            *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group at position C2 and another at position C4.\n            *   The systematic name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n        *   This matches option A.

A benzene ring accounts for 4 DBEs, and a carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for 1 DBE, which totals 5. This suggests the presence of both a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it is adjacent to a CH₂ group (n+1 rule, 2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH₂ group. Its chemical shift suggests it's adjacent to both an electron-withdrawing group (the aldehyde) and an aromatic ring. The splitting pattern, a doublet (d), confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2 peaks). This confirms the presence of a **-CH₂-CHO** (acetaldehyde) fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are classic signals for a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons in this region is indicative of a primary amine group (-NH₂) attached to an aromatic ring. The protons are exchangeable, which often results in a broad signal.

These are the classic conditions for a **base-catalyzed self-aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. After protonation of the resulting alkoxide, an aldol addition product is formed.\n            *   Intermediate Product (Aldol Adduct): **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (D).\n        2.  **Condensation (Dehydration):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (elimination of a water molecule). The base removes the acidic alpha-proton (at C2), and the hydroxyl group from the beta-carbon (C3) leaves. This forms a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The stability is enhanced because the new C=C double bond is in conjugation with both the aldehyde's C=O group and one of the aromatic rings.\n            *   Final Product (Condensation Product): The double bond forms between C2 and C3, resulting in **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product.**\n\nThe question asks for the final product.

NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    1.  The first set of reagents (NaNO2 + HCl, typically at 0-5 °C) is used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2⁺Cl⁻).\n    2.  The second reagent (H2O, often with gentle warming) is used to hydrolyze the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from water.\n    *   This two-step process effectively converts the amino group into a hydroxyl group.\n    *   **Product after Step 2:** **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n        ```\n          HO--[Benzene Ring]--CH2--CHO\n        ```\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) in water, with heating.\n    *   The substrate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde that has acidic protons on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon).\n    *   These conditions (aldehyde with α-hydrogens + strong base + heat) are classic for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the product of the Aldol Condensation.**\n\nThe aldol condensation is a two-part process:\n\n1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton from one aldehyde molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n    *   Let's denote the 4-hydroxyphenyl group as Ar-OH. The reaction is:\n        Ar-OH-CH2-CHO  +  Ar-OH-CH2-CHO  --(KOH)-->  Ar-OH-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ar-OH)-CHO\n    *   The systematic name of this addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The term \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions indicates that the aldol addition product will undergo dehydration (elimination of a water molecule). The acidic α-proton and the β-hydroxyl group are removed, forming a double bond. This is highly favorable as it creates a stable, conjugated system (α,β-unsaturated aldehyde).\n    *   Ar-OH-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ar-OH)-CHO  --(Heat)-->  Ar-OH-CH2-CH=C(Ar-OH)-CHO + H2O\n    *   The systematic name of this final condensation product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince the reaction is heated, the reaction will proceed to completion to form the more thermodynamically stable dehydrated product. The final product is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed from the full aldol condensation.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material (C8H9NO) from the 1H-NMR data.**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The formula for DoU is C - H/2 - N/2 + 1.\n    DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    (Correction from initial thought: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5).\n    A DoU of 4 usually indicates a benzene ring. The extra degree of unsaturation corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR signals:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** The chemical shift (> 9 ppm) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it's coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (n=2 neighbors).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons in this region is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2) attached to an aromatic ring. The broadening is due to fast proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The multiplicity is a doublet (d), indicating it is coupled to a single adjacent proton (n=1 neighbor). This fits with it being adjacent to the aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n\n3.  **Assemble the structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent is a -CH2-CHO group (an acetaldehyde group). The coupling confirms this: the -CHO proton is a triplet (coupled to -CH2-), and the -CH2- protons are a doublet (coupled to -CHO).\n    *   Putting these pieces together gives **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula: C6H4 (from the ring) + C2H3O (from -CH2CHO) + NH2 (from the amine) = C8H(4+3+2)NO = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O.**\n    *   The first set of reagents (NaNO2, HCl, typically at 0-5°C) is used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   The second reagent (H2O, often with warming) reacts with the diazonium salt to replace the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing N2 gas. This is a standard method to convert an aniline to a phenol.\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat.**\n    *   This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This compound is an aldehyde with acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n    *   The reaction proceeds in two stages: aldol addition followed by dehydration.\n\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:**\n        *   The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate ion.\n        *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        *   Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives the aldol addition product.\n\n        The structure of the aldol addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (which corresponds to option B).\n\n        ```\n             OH                                   OH         O         OH\n             |                                    |         ||         |\n           2 C6H4-CH2-CHO   --(KOH)-->    C6H4-CH2-CH-CH(C6H4)-CHO\n        (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde)      (Aldol Addition Product - Option B)\n        ```\n\n    2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):**\n        *   The \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions strongly suggests that the aldol addition product will undergo dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated system.\n        *   The dehydration eliminates the -OH group from C3 and a proton from the α-carbon (C2). This is favored because it results in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new C=C double bond is conjugated with the C=O of the aldehyde group, as well as one of the phenyl rings.\n\n        The structure of the final dehydrated product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n        ```\n              OH         O         OH                   OH          O         OH\n              |         ||         |                   |          ||         |\n        C6H4-CH2-CH-CH(C6H4)-CHO   --(Heat, -H2O)-->   C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4)-CHO\n           (Aldol Adduct - Option B)                 (Aldol Condensation Product - Option A)\n        ```\n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   The final product derived from the reaction sequence is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n*   This matches option A.\n*   Option B is the intermediate aldol adduct, which is not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   Options C and D have incorrect structures/functional groups.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula C8H9NO and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The formula for DoU is C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2), where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.\n    DoU = 8 + 1 - (9/2) - (0/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond or ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** The chemical shift (> 9 ppm) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent equivalent protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). This points to a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde. It's a doublet (d) because it's coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2). This confirms the **-CH2-CHO** (acetaldehyde) group. This group also contains a C=O double bond, which accounts for the final degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.0 ppm), both doublets and integrating to 2 protons each, are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for an amino group (**-NH2**) attached to the aromatic ring. The protons are exchangeable, leading to a broad signal.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with an -NH2 group and a -CH2-CHO group as substituents.\n    The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula:\n    C6H4 (from the ring) + C2H3O (from -CH2CHO) + NH2 = C8H(4+3+2)NO = **C8H9NO**.

The -N2+ group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from water. This is a variation of the Sandmeyer reaction.\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Structure: HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n\n2.  **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This is a strong base (KOH) with heat applied to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   This molecule has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**. The \"condensation\" part implies that an initial aldol addition is followed by a dehydration reaction, which is driven by the applied heat.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n        b.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate anion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        c.  **Aldol Addition Product:** After protonation of the resulting alkoxide, the aldol addition product is formed. Its systematic name is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (This corresponds to option A).\n        d.  **Dehydration:** With heating, this aldol adduct readily loses a molecule of water (dehydration). The -OH group from carbon-3 is eliminated along with an α-proton from the adjacent carbon-2.\n        *   Eliminating the H from C2 is highly favored because it creates a double bond between C2 and C3, resulting in an **α,β-unsaturated aldehyde**. This product is thermodynamically very stable because the new C=C double bond is in conjugation with both the aldehyde's C=O group and the phenyl ring at C2.\n        *   The resulting final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the options against the final product.**\n\n*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol *addition* product, an intermediate before the dehydration step caused by heat.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.

Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.

The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to one adjacent proton. This is consistent with the aldehyde proton of the -CH2-CHO fragment. The chemical shift of 3.66 ppm is typical for benzylic protons that are also alpha to a carbonyl group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a para (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. The relatively upfield shifts suggest at least one electron-donating group is attached to the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is indicative of an exchangeable group like -OH or -NH2. Given the molecular formula contains nitrogen, this is the primary amine group (-NH2).\n\n*   **Assemble the structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n    *   Let's check the formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (side chain) = C8H9NO.

These conditions are perfect for an **aldol condensation** reaction. Since there is only one type of aldehyde present, it will be a self-condensation.\n\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. Subsequent protonation yields the aldol addition product.\n        *   Addition Product: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal.

The proton on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl (C2) is removed, and the -OH group on the beta carbon (C3) is eliminated. This forms a double bond between C2 and C3, resulting in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        *   Final Product: The dehydration of the aldol adduct leads to the formation of **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.

Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound from the molecular formula (C8H9NO) and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DBE).\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 suggests a benzene ring (DBE=4) and a carbonyl group (C=O, DBE=1).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3 peaks). This suggests a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet (d) splitting confirms it is coupled to a single proton (the aldehyde proton, n+1=1+1=2 peaks). The chemical shift is consistent with a CH2 group attached to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group. This confirms the `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets and integrating to 2 protons each, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two types of aromatic protons are ortho-coupled to each other. The presence of signals at relatively high field (especially 6.51 ppm) suggests a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is very typical for a primary amine group (-NH2), which is a strong electron-donating group. The broadness is due to quadrupole relaxation of the nitrogen nucleus and/or chemical exchange.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring (`C6H4`).\n    *   The substituents are an amino group (`-NH2`) and an acetaldehyde group (`-CH2CHO`).\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula: `C6H4` + `NH2` + `C2H3O` = `C8H9NO`. This matches the given formula.\n    *   The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The amino group at C1 makes the ortho protons (C2, C6) shielded (upfield), and the acetaldehyde group at C4 makes its ortho protons (C3, C5) deshielded (downfield). This is consistent with the signals at 6.51 ppm (ortho to NH2) and 6.98 ppm (ortho to CH2CHO).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    *   This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    *   Step 1 (NaNO2 + HCl at 0-5 °C) is diazotization, which converts the primary amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n        `p-NH2-C6H4-CH2CHO` -> `p-Cl-N2+-C6H4-CH2CHO`\n    *   Step 2 (H2O, warm) is the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. The -N2+ group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by an -OH group from water.\n        `p-Cl-N2+-C6H4-CH2CHO` -> `p-HO-C6H4-CH2CHO`\n    *   The product of these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This reagent provides a strong base (KOH) and heat, which are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n    *   The aldehyde, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has acidic α-protons on the methylene group (`-CH2-`) adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n    *   **Aldol Condensation Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** A hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n            `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH- <=> [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]- + H2O`\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n            `[HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]-` + `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO` -> `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(O-)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO`\n        3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to give the aldol addition product, a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n            `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO`\n            The IUPAC name for this intermediate is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option B).\n\n        4.  **Dehydration:** The reaction is performed under **heat**, which promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The base (OH-) removes the acidic proton from the α-carbon (C2), and the hydroxyl group from the β-carbon (C3) is eliminated.\n            `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO` --(Heat, -H2O)--> `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO`\n\n    *   **Identifying the Final Product:**\n        The structure is `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO`.\n        Let's name it according to IUPAC rules:\n        - The main chain is a butenal (4 carbons, C=C, CHO).\n        - The aldehyde is C1.\n        - The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it's a `but-2-enal`.\n        - There is a `4-hydroxyphenyl` group on C2.\n        - There is a `4-hydroxyphenyl` group on C4 (as part of the `HO-C6H4-CH2-` group).\n        - The name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the derived product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This matches our derived final product of the aldol condensation.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents (should be hydroxyphenyl) and incorrect double bond position.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\n**1. Analysis of the Starting Compound (C8H9NO) using 1H-NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5. A DBE of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (4 units) plus one additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., a C=O double bond).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Spectroscopy Data Breakdown:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n=2, based on the n+1 rule), meaning it is part of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring (A-A'-B-B' system). The upfield chemical shifts (below 7.2 ppm) indicate the presence of a strong electron-donating group (EDG) on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons, coupled with the presence of nitrogen in the formula, points to a primary amine group (-NH2). An amino group is a strong EDG, consistent with the upfield aromatic signals.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The splitting, a doublet (d), indicates it is coupled to one adjacent proton (n=1). This perfectly matches the -CH2- group in the -CH2-CHO fragment, as it is coupled only to the aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:**\n    Assembling the fragments gives a para-substituted benzene ring with an amino group (-NH2) and a 2-oxoethyl group (-CH2-CHO) as substituents.\n    The structure is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n    Let's verify the formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2CHO = C8H9NO. The formula is correct.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    1.  The reaction of a primary aromatic amine with sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and a strong acid (HCl) at low temperatures (0-5 °C) is a **diazotization reaction**. This converts the amino group (-NH2) into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n    2.  Adding water (H2O) to the diazonium salt and warming leads to the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt, replacing the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   The intermediate after these two steps is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The reagent is a strong base (KOH) with heat, and the substrate is an aldehyde with α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group adjacent to the -CHO group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation reaction**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from one molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion.\n        b.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate anion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal.\n        c.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to yield a β-hydroxy aldehyde, the **aldol addition product**. This intermediate is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n        d.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) and a hydrogen atom from the α-carbon (C2) are eliminated. This dehydration step is highly favored because it forms a C=C double bond that is conjugated with both the aldehyde's C=O group and the attached phenyl ring, resulting in a highly stabilized α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n*   **Final Product Identification:**\n    *   The aldol addition product is: (HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4-OH)-CHO\n    *   Upon dehydration, it forms the aldol condensation product: (HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH=C(C6H4-OH)-CHO\n    *   Let's name this molecule based on IUPAC rules:\n        *   The parent chain is a butenal (4-carbon chain with an aldehyde and a double bond).\n        *   The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it is a **but-2-enal**.\n        *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group attached to C2.\n        *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group attached to C4.\n        *   Therefore, the name of the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from its molecular formula and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The formula for DoU is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DoU = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (1) suggests a double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C) or another ring.\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which, according to the n+1 rule, means it is adjacent to a CH2 group (2+1=3 peaks). This points to a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets, each integrating to two protons. This pattern is a classic indicator of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The relatively upfield shifts (especially 6.51 ppm) suggest the presence of a strong electron-donating group.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for an amine (-NH2) or alcohol (-OH) group due to proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling (for N). Given the molecular formula contains nitrogen, this is an -NH2 group. This is a strong electron-donating group, which is consistent with the upfield aromatic signals.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH2 group. The multiplicity is a doublet (d), which means it's coupled to a single proton. This fits perfectly with the `-CH2-CHO` fragment, where this CH2 is coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The two substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n    The structure is therefore **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's verify the formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (side chain) = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This reagent mixture generates nitrous acid (HONO) in situ. This is the first step of the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt, -N2+Cl-.\n    The intermediate is **(4-(2-oxoethyl)phenyl)diazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt solution and warming it causes the diazonium group (-N2+) to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a standard method for synthesizing phenols from anilines.\n    The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Structure: `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO`\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat. The reactant is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which is an aldehyde that possesses two acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the α-protons on the -CH2- group).\n    This set of conditions is perfect for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n    *   **Step 3a (Enolate Formation):** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-proton to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion.\n        `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH- <=> [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]- + H2O`\n    *   **Step 3b (Aldol Addition):** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, known as the aldol addition product. After protonation of the alkoxide intermediate, the structure is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option C).\n    *   **Step 3c (Dehydration/Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. Heating the aldol addition product in a basic solution causes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The α-proton is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group is eliminated, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. This creates a conjugated system (α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which is thermodynamically very stable.\n\n        *   Addition Product: `(HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4-OH)-CHO`\n        *   Elimination of H2O from the C2 (H) and C3 (OH) positions gives:\n        *   Final Product: `(HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH=C(C6H4-OH)-CHO`\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the Final Product.**\n    Let's name the condensation product using IUPAC rules.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the aldehyde is four carbons long: `butanal`.\n    *   The aldehyde carbon is C1.\n    *   There is a double bond between C2 and C3: `but-2-enal`.\n    *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group on C2.\n    *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group attached to the CH2 group at C4.\n    *   The name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThis name and structure match option D.

The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which means it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-) according to the n+1 rule (1+1=2 neighbours -> triplet, so n=2). This confirms the presence of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region for 2 protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a doublet integrating to 2 protons. This corresponds to the -CH2- group which is adjacent to the aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting is consistent, as the CH2 protons are split by the single CHO proton into a doublet (n+1 = 1+1 = 2). The chemical shift is consistent with a benzylic methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have the following fragments:\n    1.  A para-substituted benzene ring (-C6H4-).\n    2.  An amine group (-NH2).\n    3.  An ethanal group (-CH2CHO).\n    The only way to assemble these fragments to satisfy the formula C8H9NO and the NMR data is to have the -NH2 and -CH2CHO groups at the para (1 and 4) positions of the benzene ring.\n\n    The structure of the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO₂ + HCl**\n    This set of reagents is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N₂⁺).\n    The product is 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride: [⁺N≡N-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO]Cl⁻.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H₂O**\n    Adding water to a diazonium salt and warming (which is implicit in step 3's \"Heat\") causes the diazonium group to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction (hydrolysis of the diazonium salt).\n    The product after this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**: HO-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH₂- group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives the aldol addition product.\n        *   Nucleophile: [HO-C₆H₄-CH-CHO]⁻\n        *   Electrophile: HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO\n        *   Addition Product: After protonation, the product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**.

Dehydration of the aldol product involves removing the -OH group from C3 and a proton from an adjacent carbon (C2 or C4).\n        *   Removal of the acidic α-proton from C2 and the -OH from C3 is strongly favored because it results in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The resulting double bond is conjugated with both the carbonyl group and the adjacent phenyl ring, creating a very stable, extended conjugated system.\n        *   The product of this dehydration is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.

In an aldol reaction performed with heat, the reaction generally does not stop at the addition stage (product D).

Therefore, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal is the final major product of the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n    1.  **Analysis of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\n        *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - H/2 + N/2`. For C8H9NO, DoU = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5. A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which has a DoU of 4) and one additional degree of unsaturation (like a C=C or C=O bond).\n\n        *   **1H-NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n            *   `9.72 (t, 1H)`: The chemical shift (> 9 ppm) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to 2 adjacent protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). This indicates a `-CH2-CHO` group.\n            *   `3.66 (d, 2H)`: This signal corresponds to 2 protons. The multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to 1 adjacent proton (1+1=2). This fits the `-CH2-` part of the `-CH2-CHO` group, where these two protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n            *   `6.98 (d, 2H)` and `6.51 (d, 2H)`: These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield (compared to benzene at 7.3 ppm), suggesting the presence of at least one electron-donating group.\n            *   `6.27 (bs, 2H)`: This is a broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons, which is typical for a primary amine (-NH2). The protons can exchange, and nitrogen's quadrupole moment often leads to broad signals.\n\n        *   **Structure Determination:**\n            *   We have three fragments: a para-substituted benzene ring (`-C6H4-`), an amino group (`-NH2`), and an ethanal group (`-CH2CHO`).\n            *   Let's assemble them: The two substituents must be `-NH2` and `-CH2CHO` at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring.\n            *   The structure is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal** (also known as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde).\n            *   Let's verify the formula: `C6H4` (ring) + `C2H3O` (ethanal part) + `NH2` (amine part) = `C8H(4+3+2)NO` = `C8H9NO`. This matches the given molecular formula. The structure is consistent with all the data.\n\n    2.  **Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n        *   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (at low temperature, typically 0-5 °C)**\n            *   This is the standard reagent for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The `-NH2` group on the benzene ring is converted to a diazonium salt (`-N2+Cl-`).\n            *   The product of this step is **2-(4-diazoniophenyl)ethanal chloride**.\n\n        *   **Step 2: H2O (usually with warming)**\n            *   This reaction involves the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. The diazonium group (`-N2+`) is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (`-OH`) group from water.\n            *   The product of this step is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal** (also known as 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n\n        *   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n            *   The reactant is now 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal. This is an aldehyde that has two acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the `-CH2-` group).\n            *   KOH is a strong base, and heat is supplied. These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**. Since there's only one type of aldehyde, it will be a **self-condensation**.\n            *   The mechanism involves two main stages:\n                1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an alpha-proton from one aldehyde molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, called the aldol addition product. The structure is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option A).\n                2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **heat** promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The base removes the now even more acidic proton from the α-carbon (C2), and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) is eliminated. This forms a double bond between the α and β carbons. The resulting product is a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new C=C double bond is conjugated with the C=O bond of the aldehyde.\n\n    3.  **Determination of the Final Product**\n\n        *   Let R = 4-hydroxyphenyl. The starting material for the aldol is `R-CH2-CHO`.\n        *   The aldol addition product is `R-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(R)-CHO`.\n        *   Dehydration of this intermediate yields `R-CH2-CH=C(R)-CHO`.\n        *   Let's name this final structure using IUPAC nomenclature:\n            *   The main chain is a butenal (4 carbons, aldehyde, C=C).\n            *   The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it's a **but-2-enal**.\n            *   There are two 4-hydroxyphenyl groups, one attached to C2 and one to the `-CH2-` group at C4.\n            *   The full name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n    4.  **Matching with Options**\n        *   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal is the aldol *addition* product, but the reaction is heated, so dehydration will occur.\n        *   B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal has the wrong substituents (phenyl instead of hydroxyphenyl) and the wrong position for the double bond.\n        *   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal is missing a second hydroxyphenyl group.\n        *   D) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** matches the expected final product of the aldol condensation reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula for a saturated acyclic amine/amide is CnH2n+3N. For C8, this would be C8H19N. The given formula is C8H9NO. The difference in hydrogen atoms is (19+1(for O)) - 9 = 11. Wait, let's use the standard formula: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5. A degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBE) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates that it is coupled to an adjacent methylene (-CH2-) group (n+1 rule, 2+1=3).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde. It appears as a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (n+1 rule, 1+1=2). This confirms the presence of a `-CH2-CHO` fragment (acetaldehyde group).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons and appearing as doublets, are classic indicators of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons in this region is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to the aromatic ring. The strong electron-donating nature of the -NH2 group explains the upfield shift of the ortho protons (6.51 ppm), while the protons ortho to the other substituent are more downfield (6.98 ppm).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    The fragments are a para-substituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2-CHO group. Putting them together gives 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde. The molecular formula C8H9NO is consistent with this structure.\n\n    **Starting Material (A):** 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde\n     ![Starting Material: 2-(4-aminophenyl) acetaldehyde](https://i.imgur.com/gK96tqA.png)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n*   **Reaction 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    This two-step sequence is a standard method to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    1.  **Diazotization:** The primary amine (-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl at 0-5 °C) to form a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water upon gentle warming. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n    This sequence converts the starting 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde into **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde (B)**.\n     ![Intermediate: 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetaldehyde](https://i.imgur.com/Fw8V43X.png)\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This reagent provides a strong base (KOH) and heat. The intermediate **(B)** is an aldehyde with acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). This sets up the conditions for an **aldol condensation**. Since the aldehyde reacts with itself, it's a self-aldol condensation.\n\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH removes an α-proton from one molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde. Subsequent protonation yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product. In this case, it is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option B).\n    3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions strongly favors the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The α-proton is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group is eliminated, forming a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This is the aldol condensation product.\n\n    Let's trace the formation of the condensation product from the aldol adduct:\n    Adduct: `HO-Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(PhOH)-CHO`\n    Dehydration (loss of H from C-2 and OH from C-3) leads to the formation of a double bond between C-2 and C-3.\n    Final Product: `HO-Ph-CH2-CH=C(PhOH)-CHO`, which is named **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n     ![Final Product: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) but-2-enal](https://i.imgur.com/kS94b2q.png)\n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final, dehydrated aldol condensation product. The structure and name match our derived product.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure; it's missing the hydroxyl groups.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Part 1: Elucidating the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO)**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The formula for DoU is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond or ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR spectrum:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity (t) indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2), which must be a CH2 group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the CH2 group adjacent to the aldehyde.

This corresponds to option (D).\n        c.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The problem specifies \"Heat\".

The C=O group of an aldehyde or ketone would account for this extra DBE.\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Signals:**\n    *   **`9.72 ppm (t, 1H)`:** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means its neighboring carbon has 2 protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). So, we have a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **`3.66 ppm (d, 2H)`:** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde. Its multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning its neighboring atom has 1 proton (1+1=2). This confirms the coupling with the single aldehyde proton. The fragment is `-CH2-CHO`.\n    *   **`6.98 ppm (d, 2H)` and `6.51 ppm (d, 2H)`:** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets and each integrates to 2 protons. This pattern is characteristic of a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The relatively upfield shifts (normal benzene is ~7.3 ppm) suggest the presence of electron-donating groups.\n    *   **`6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)`:** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. This is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2) attached to an aromatic ring. The broadening is due to nitrogen's quadrupole moment and/or proton exchange.\n\n*   **Assemble the structure:**\n    We have the following fragments:\n    1.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  An amine group (-NH2).\n    3.  An ethylaldehyde group (-CH2-CHO).\n    Combining these pieces, we get 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde. Let's check its molecular formula: C6H4 (from the ring) + CH2CHO + NH2 gives C8H9NO.

The intermediate is an aldehyde that possesses protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- protons). These conditions are classic for an **aldol condensation** reaction. Since there is only one type of aldehyde, this will be a **self-condensation**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the mechanism and product of the aldol condensation.**\n\n1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate anion.\n    `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH- <=> [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]- + H2O`\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate anion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde.\n    `[HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]- + O=CH-CH2-C6H4-OH -> product`\n\n3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to form the **aldol addition product**.\n    Let's trace the carbon backbone: C1 is the aldehyde carbon. The new bond forms between the α-carbon (C2) of the first molecule and the carbonyl carbon (which becomes C3) of the second molecule.\n    The addition product is:\n    `HO-C6H4-CH(CHO)-CH(OH)-CH2-C6H4-OH`\n    To name this, we find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (aldehyde). This is a butanal chain.\n    `CHO(C1)-CH(C2)(Ar-OH)-CH(C3)(OH)-CH2(C4)(Ar-OH)`\n    The IUPAC name is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to **option C**.\n\n4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **Heat**. This provides the energy for a subsequent elimination (dehydration) reaction. The aldol addition product loses a molecule of water to form a more stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The hydrogen on the α-carbon (C2) and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) are eliminated.\n    `3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal --(Heat, -H2O)--> Product`\n    The elimination creates a double bond between C2 and C3.\n    The structure of the final product is:\n    `CHO(C1)-C(C2)(Ar-OH)=CH(C3)-CH2(C4)(Ar-OH)`\n    The IUPAC name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to **option B**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction proceeds through an aldol addition to form the intermediate shown in option C. However, because the reaction is heated, the final, most stable product is the dehydrated condensation product. The conjugation of the newly formed C=C double bond with both the carbonyl group and one of the aromatic rings provides a significant thermodynamic driving force for this dehydration step. Therefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\n**1. Analysis of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula is C₈H₉NO.

Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate anion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\n    *   **c. Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide intermediate is protonated by water to give the aldol addition product.

The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates that it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), as per the n+1 rule (2+1=3). This confirms a **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde. Its chemical shift is consistent with being attached to both an aromatic ring and the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group. The splitting pattern, a doublet (d), confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2). This further supports the **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets integrating to 2 protons each, are classic indicators of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to 2 protons is typical for exchangeable protons like those in an amino (-NH2) or hydroxyl (-OH) group.

Assembling these gives **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n        Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (from the ring) + C2H3O (from -CH2CHO) + NH2 = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n        The structure of the starting material is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n    1.  **Reagents: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n        *   This is a two-step process. The first step (NaNO2 + HCl, typically at 0-5 °C) is the **diazotization** of the primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n        *   The second step (H2O, with warming) is the **hydrolysis** of the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) from water.\n        *   The net result of these two steps is the conversion of the primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n        *   The intermediate product formed after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n        *   Structure: HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n\n    2.  **Reagent: 3. aq.

A strong base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of one molecule to form an enolate nucleophile. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule.\n        *   **Aldol Addition:** The initial product is the β-hydroxy aldehyde, called the aldol adduct.\n            *   Molecule 1 (enolate): [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]⁻\n            *   Molecule 2 (aldehyde): HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n            *   Attack and protonation yield the aldol adduct: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (D).\n        *   **Aldol Condensation (Dehydration):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. Heating an aldol addition product in the presence of base (or acid) causes dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) to form an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This product is thermodynamically more stable due to the extended conjugation between the double bond and the carbonyl group.\n            *   Aldol Adduct: HO-Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ph-OH)-CHO\n            *   The hydroxyl group is on the β-carbon (C-3), and an acidic proton is on the α-carbon (C-2).\n            *   Elimination of H2O (the -OH from C-3 and the -H from C-2) forms a double bond between C-2 and C-3.\n            *   Final Product: HO-Ph-CH2-CH=C(Ph-OH)-CHO\n        *   **Naming the final product:**\n            *   The main chain is a butenal (4 carbons, aldehyde at C-1, double bond at C-2). So, `but-2-enal`.\n            *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group at C-2 and another (4-hydroxyphenyl) group at C-4.\n            *   The IUPAC name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option (A).\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclusion**\n    Since the reaction is heated, the final isolated product is the result of condensation (dehydration), not just addition. Therefore, the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde is the correct answer.\n\n    *   Start: 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n    *   -> Intermediate: 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde\n    *   -> Final Product (Aldol Condensation): 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - This is the correct aldol condensation product.\nB) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure.\nC) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect structure (missing OH groups).\nD) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the aldol addition product, which would be the intermediate before the final dehydration step promoted by heat.\n\nThe final product is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the initial compound from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - 9/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n*   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). This leaves 1 DBE, which corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O) or a C=C double bond.\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   `9.72 ppm (t, 1H)`: This chemical shift and multiplicity (triplet) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) that is adjacent to a CH2 group (n+1=3, so n=2). This confirms the presence of a `-CH2-CHO` fragment and the C=O group.\n    *   `6.98 ppm (d, 2H)` and `6.51 ppm (d, 2H)`: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicate a *para*-substituted benzene ring. The relatively upfield shifts suggest the ring is substituted with electron-donating groups.\n    *   `6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)`: A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group. An amine is an electron-donating group, consistent with the aromatic signals.\n    *   `3.66 ppm (d, 2H)`: A doublet for two protons, which corresponds to the -CH2- group coupled to the aldehyde proton (-CHO), as established from the aldehyde signal.\n\n*   **Assembling the structure:**\n    Putting all the pieces together (a *para*-substituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group), the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The formula C8H9NO matches this structure (C6H4 for the ring, NH2, and C2H3O for the side chain).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\nThe starting material is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl (diazotization)**\n    This reaction converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    The product is **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n    \n    `H2N-C6H4-CH2CHO  -- (NaNO2, HCl) -->  Cl-N2+-C6H4-CH2CHO`\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O (hydrolysis)**\n    Warming the aqueous solution of the diazonium salt causes the -N2+ group to be replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing N2 gas.\n    The product is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    \n    `Cl-N2+-C6H4-CH2CHO  -- (H2O, Heat) -->  HO-C6H4-CH2CHO + N2 + HCl`\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    The reactant for this step is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This molecule has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-aldol condensation.\n\n    *   **Step a: Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde, known as the aldol adduct.\n        \n        Aldol Adduct: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to **Option D**.\n        \n        `2 * HO-C6H4-CH2CHO --(KOH)--> HO-C6H4-CH(CHO)-CH(OH)-CH2-C6H4-OH`\n\n    *   **Step b: Dehydration:** The reaction is performed with \"Heat\". In aldol reactions, heating the aldol adduct in the presence of base causes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This is because the resulting conjugated system is thermodynamically very stable. The α-proton is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group is eliminated.\n        \n        `HO-C6H4-CH(CHO)-CH(OH)-CH2-C6H4-OH --(Heat, -H2O)--> HO-C6H4-C(CHO)=CH-CH2-C6H4-OH`\n\n        Final Product: The resulting α,β-unsaturated aldehyde is named **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to **Option B**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction proceeds through the aldol adduct (D), but because heat is applied, the final, stable product is the dehydrated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde (B). Therefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\n**1.

The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a CH2 group), according to the n+1 rule.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets integrating to 2 protons each, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2). The protons are exchangeable, leading to a broad signal.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet in the aliphatic region integrating to 2 protons. This corresponds to a CH2 group. The doublet splitting means it's adjacent to a carbon with 1 proton (a CH group), which in this case is the aldehyde's CH.\n\n*   **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and a 2-oxoethyl group (-CH2CHO).\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the structure **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**. Let's verify it matches the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n        *   C: 6 (ring) + 2 (side chain) = 8\n        *   H: 4 (ring) + 2 (NH2) + 2 (CH2) + 1 (CHO) = 9\n        *   N: 1\n        *   O: 1\n    *   The structure is consistent with the formula and all NMR signals.

Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This reagent mixture is used for diazotization. The primary aromatic amine group (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   *Starting Material:* 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n    *   *Product after Step 1:* 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt (often with gentle warming) leads to hydrolysis. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from water.\n    *   *Intermediate Product:* 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step subjects the intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, to a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:**\n        1.  The base (OH-) removes an acidic alpha-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde (the protons on the -CH2- group) to form an enolate.\n        2.  This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule.\n        3.  After protonation, this forms an aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n    *   **Aldol Condensation (Dehydration):**\n        The \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct. The alpha-proton (on C2) and the beta-hydroxyl group (on C3) are eliminated to form a stable, conjugated C=C double bond. This process is called condensation.\n        *   Aldol Adduct: `(HO)Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(PhOH)-CHO`\n        *   Dehydration removes the H from C2 and the OH from C3.\n        *   Final Product: `(HO)Ph-CH2-CH=C(PhOH)-CHO`\n\n*   **Identify the Final Product:**\n    *   The name of the condensation product `(HO)Ph-CH2-CH=C(PhOH)-CHO` is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n    *   This matches option **A**.\n    *   Option (C) is the intermediate aldol adduct, but the inclusion of \"Heat\" indicates the reaction proceeds to the final condensation product.\n    *   Option (B) has an incorrect molecular formula.\n    *   Option (D) incorrectly has phenyl groups instead of the hydroxyphenyl groups that are formed in the second step of the reaction.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the entire reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\n**1.

The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt, -N2+Cl-.\n        *   Product after step 1: 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride `[Cl-][+N≡N]-C6H4-CH2CHO`.\n    *   **Reagent 2: H2O.** Adding water to an aryl diazonium salt (often with gentle heating) results in a **hydrolysis** reaction, where the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming a phenol.\n        *   Product after step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde** `HO-C6H4-CH2CHO`.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Analyze the Final Reaction.**\n    *   **Substrate:** 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde `(HO-C6H4-CH2CHO)`.\n    *   **Reagents: aq. KOH, Heat.** This is a strong base (KOH) with heat. The substrate is an aldehyde with acidic alpha-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an acidic alpha-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n            `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH- ⇌ HO-C6H4-CH(-)-CHO + H2O`\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n            `HO-C6H4-CH(-)-CHO` + `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO` → `(HO-C6H4-CH2)-CH(O-)-CH(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)`\n        3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde, the **aldol addition product**.\n            Product: `(HO-C6H4-CH2)-CH(OH)-CH(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)`\n            The IUPAC name is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This structure matches option **D**.\n        4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the aldol addition product to form an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The hydroxyl group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are eliminated.\n            `(HO-C6H4-CH2)-CH(OH)-CH(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)` --(Heat)--> `(HO-C6H4-CH2)-CH=C(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)` + H2O\n            This dehydration is highly favorable because the resulting double bond is conjugated with both the aldehyde's C=O group and the aromatic ring on C2, creating a very stable system.\n\n5.  **Step 4: Identify the Final Product Structure and Name.**\n    *   The final condensation product is `(HO-C6H4-CH2)-CH=C(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)`.\n    *   Let's determine the IUPAC name for this structure:\n        *   The principal functional group is the aldehyde (`-al`).\n        *   The longest carbon chain containing the aldehyde has 4 carbons (`but-`).\n        *   There is a double bond at C2 (`-2-en`). So the parent chain is `but-2-enal`.\n        *   There are two substituents: a `(4-hydroxyphenyl)` group at C2 and another `(4-hydroxyphenyl)` group at C4.\n        *   The full name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n    *   This name exactly matches option **A**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The reaction sequence converts 4-(aminophenyl)acetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation (due to KOH and heat) to yield 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal as the final stable product. Option D is the intermediate aldol addition product, but the specified heat drives the reaction to the final condensed product, A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound from the given molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating DoU is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (3 double bonds + 1 ring). The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a carbonyl group (C=O). This fits the data well.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a -CH2- group), according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3 peaks). This confirms the presence of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet (d) multiplicity is because it's coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2 peaks). This further confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for an amine (-NH2) group. The protons are exchangeable, which leads to broadening.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are the -NH2 group and the -CH2-CHO group.\n    *   Let's check if the formula matches: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (side chain) = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO. The formula is correct.\n    *   The starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde (HOOC-CH2-C6H4-NH2)\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    *   These are the reagents for **diazotization**, which converts a primary aromatic amine (Ar-NH2) into a diazonium salt (Ar-N2⁺Cl⁻). This reaction is typically performed at low temperatures (0-5 °C).\n    *   The product after this step is **4-(diazonium chloride)phenylacetaldehyde**. The structure is [Cl⁻N₂⁺]-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O (usually with warming)**\n    *   Aromatic diazonium salts are unstable and react with water upon gentle warming. The diazonium group (-N₂⁺) is an excellent leaving group, and it is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from water. Nitrogen gas (N₂) is evolved.\n    *   The product after this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**. The structure is HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This is a strong base (KOH) with heat. The reactant is an aldehyde (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) that possesses alpha-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH₂- group next to the aldehyde).\n    *   Aldehydes with alpha-hydrogens undergo a base-catalyzed **Aldol Condensation** under these conditions. This is a two-part process: an aldol addition followed by a dehydration.\n    *   **Part A: Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic alpha-hydrogen to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of another molecule of the aldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields an aldol addition product.\n        *   **Enolate formation:** [HO-C₆H₄-CH-CHO]⁻\n        *   **Nucleophilic attack:** The enolate attacks a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        *   **Addition Product:** After protonation, the product is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to **option A**.\n        \n        *Structure of the Aldol Addition Product:*\n        ```\n              OH\n              |\n        HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CH-CH(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO \n        ```\n    *   **Part B: Dehydration (Condensation):** The word \"**Heat**\" is crucial. It provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The -OH group from C-3 and the acidic alpha-hydrogen from C-2 are eliminated to form a double bond. This dehydration is highly favored because it creates a large, stable conjugated system (Aryl-C=C-C=O).\n        \n        *Structure of the Aldol Condensation Product:*\n        ```\n        HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CH=C(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO \n        ```\n        Let's name this final product: The parent chain is a four-carbon aldehyde with a double bond at C-2, so it's a **but-2-enal**. It has 4-hydroxyphenyl groups at positions C-2 and C-4. The name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to **option B**.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion.**\n\nThe sequence of reactions transforms 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-condensation under basic, heated conditions. The final stable product is the dehydrated aldol condensation product.\n\n*   Option A is the aldol *addition* product, which is an intermediate.\n*   Option B is the aldol *condensation* product, which is the final product formed with heat.\n*   Options C and D are incorrect based on the reaction mechanism and stoichiometry.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material (C8H9NO) from the NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation. This leaves one more degree of unsaturation, likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the other signals.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H-NMR signals:**\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a CH2 group), according to the n+1 rule. This suggests a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH2 group. The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it's coupled to a single adjacent proton (a CH group). This is consistent with the `-CH2-CHO` fragment, where the CH2 protons are coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets with an integration of 2H each, which is a classic pattern for a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring. The upfield chemical shifts (compared to benzene at 7.3 ppm) suggest the ring is substituted with at least one electron-donating group.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of an amine group (-NH2). The protons are exchangeable, leading to a broad signal. An amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the structure:**\n    We have a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring with an -NH2 group and a -CH2CHO (ethanal) group as the two substituents. Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (benzene ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n\n    The starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    This is a standard reaction for converting a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is transformed into a diazonium group (-N2+Cl-). The aldehyde group remains unchanged.\n    *   Product of Step 1: **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    Diazonium salts are generally unstable and, when warmed in water, undergo hydrolysis. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a common method to synthesize phenols from anilines.\n    *   Product of Step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    The product from step 2, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde that has protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- protons). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-aldol condensation.\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an alpha-proton to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion.\n        `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH- <=> [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]- + H2O`\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives the aldol addition product.\n        Addition Product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option B).\n    3.  **Dehydration:** The reaction is performed with **heat**. This provides the energy to eliminate a molecule of water from the aldol addition product. The acidic proton on the alpha-carbon (C2) is removed, and the hydroxyl group on the beta-carbon (C3) leaves, forming a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        `3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal --(Heat, -H2O)--> 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal`\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product.**\n\nThe term \"Heat\" is a key piece of information, indicating that the reaction proceeds to the final, dehydrated condensation product, not stopping at the intermediate addition product. The final product is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed after the elimination of water.\n\nThe structure of the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option D.\n\nLet's check the IUPAC name and structure for option D:\n*   Name: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**\n*   This name describes a 4-carbon chain (`but-`) with an aldehyde (`-al`) at C1 and a double bond between C2 and C3 (`-2-en`). There are 4-hydroxyphenyl substituents on C2 and C4.\n*   Structure: `(HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH=C(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)`. This structure is the result of the dehydration of the aldol addition product, as deduced above.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the entire reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is `C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1`.\n    DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DoU of 4 usually indicates a benzene ring. The remaining DoU of 1 suggests a double bond or another ring. The presence of an oxygen atom and a very downfield proton signal points towards a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), means it's coupled to an adjacent CH₂ group (according to the n+1 rule, 2 neighboring protons -> 2+1=3 peaks). This establishes a **-CH₂-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the CH₂ group. Its chemical shift is consistent with a methylene group positioned between a benzene ring and an electron-withdrawing group like an aldehyde. The splitting, a doublet (d), confirms it is coupled to a single proton (the aldehyde proton, n+1 rule, 1 neighboring proton -> 1+1=2 peaks). This further confirms the **-CH₂-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets and integrating to 2 protons each, are a classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield, suggesting the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet corresponds to two exchangeable protons. Given the presence of nitrogen in the formula, this is an **amino group (-NH₂) **. An -NH₂ group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield position of the aromatic signals.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with an -NH₂ group and a -CH₂-CHO group as substituents. The complete structure of the starting compound is **2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n\n     ![Starting Material: 2-(4-aminophenyl) acetaldehyde](https://i.imgur.com/kS9Q7x1.png)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **1. NaNO₂ + HCl (at 0-5 °C):** This set of reagents is used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH₂) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    The product after this step is 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)acetaldehyde chloride.\n\n*   **2. H₂O:** The addition of water to the diazonium salt, often with gentle heating, leads to the hydrolysis of the diazonium group. The -N₂⁺ group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N₂ gas), and it is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from the water.\n    The product after this step is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n\n     ![Intermediate: 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetaldehyde](https://i.imgur.com/gKj60lK.png)\n\n*   **3. aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves treating the intermediate with a strong base (KOH) and heat. The intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde, has an aldehyde group and acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the aldehyde (the α-carbon). These are the perfect conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH acts as a base and removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde. This forms an aldol adduct, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (which corresponds to option A).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The word \"Heat\" is crucial. It indicates that the reaction does not stop at the aldol adduct. The adduct readily dehydrates (loses a molecule of water) to form a more stable, conjugated system. The elimination involves the -OH group on the β-carbon (C3) and the acidic proton on the α-carbon (C2). This results in the formation of a double bond between the α and β carbons (a C=C double bond conjugated with the C=O bond of the aldehyde).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the final product.**\n\nThe dehydration of the aldol adduct (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal) yields an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\nThe final structure is:\n`HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CH=C(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO`\nLet's name this compound using IUPAC nomenclature:\n*   The principal functional group is the aldehyde (-CHO), so the suffix is \"-al\".\n*   The longest carbon chain containing the aldehyde and the double bond has four carbons, so it's a \"butenal\".\n*   The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it's a \"but-2-enal\".\n*   There are two 4-hydroxyphenyl substituents, one at position C2 and one at position C4.\n*   Thus, the final product name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThis name and structure match option B.\n\n ![Final Product: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) but-2-enal](https://i.imgur.com/UEx8T1R.png)\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The formula is DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DBE = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 DBE (one ring and three double bonds). This leaves one additional degree of unsaturation, which could be a C=O or C=C bond.\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Signals:**\n    *   **9.72 (t, 1H):** A signal in the 9-10 ppm range is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity (t) indicates that the adjacent carbon has two protons (n+1 rule: 2+1=3). This suggests a -CH2-CHO fragment. The single DBE is accounted for by the C=O of the aldehyde.\n    *   **3.66 (d, 2H):** A signal for two protons, appearing as a doublet (d). This means the adjacent carbon has one proton (n+1 rule: 1+1=2). This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment, as the -CH2- protons are coupled to the single -CHO proton.\n    *   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons and appearing as doublets, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for an amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring. The protons are exchangeable.\n\n*   **Assemble the Structure:**\n    We have the following fragments:\n    *   A para-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4)\n    *   An amine group (-NH2)\n    *   An ethyl-aldehyde group (-CH2CHO)\n    Assembling these gives 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal, also known as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n    Let's check the molecular formula: C6H4(ring) + C2H3O(side chain) + NH2 = C8H(4+3+2)NO = C8H9NO.

KOH, Heat**\n    This set of conditions (a base and heat) is characteristic of an aldol condensation reaction for an aldehyde that has α-hydrogens. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has two acidic α-hydrogens on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. It will undergo self-condensation.\n\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** One molecule of the aldehyde forms an enolate ion by losing an α-hydrogen to the base (KOH). This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. This forms an aldol addition product.\n        The initial product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option D).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The α-hydrogen (on C2) and the hydroxyl group (on C3) are eliminated to form a new carbon-carbon double bond. This creates a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the double bond is conjugated with both the carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Final Product Identification:**\n    Let's draw the final condensation product and name it.\n    The structure formed after dehydration is:\n     \n\n    To name this compound using IUPAC rules:\n    1.  The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (aldehyde) has four carbons. The parent name is **butanal**.\n    2.  There is a double bond between C2 and C3. The parent name becomes **but-2-enal**.\n    3.  There is a **4-hydroxyphenyl** group attached to C2.\n    4.  There is another **4-hydroxyphenyl** group attached to C4.\n    5.  Combining these gives the name: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThis name and structure perfectly match option B. Option D is the intermediate aldol adduct before the dehydration step. Since heat is applied, the reaction proceeds to the more stable condensation product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\nFirst, let's deduce the structure of the initial compound using its molecular formula and 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring. The C=O group of an aldehyde would account for this.\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which, according to the n+1 rule, means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 hydrogens (a -CH2- group). This confirms the presence of a **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde. It appears as a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton. The chemical shift is downfield, consistent with it being alpha to a carbonyl group and also attached to an aromatic ring (benzylic).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are characteristic of a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The relatively upfield chemical shifts suggest the ring has a strong electron-donating group attached.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring. The -NH2 group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield position of the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Putting the fragments together: a para-disubstituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO (acetaldehyde) group. The only way to combine these to satisfy the formula C8H9NO is to attach the -NH2 and -CH2CHO groups at the para positions (1 and 4) of the benzene ring.\n\n    Therefore, the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nNow, let's follow the starting material through the three reaction steps.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n     ![](https://i.imgur.com/G5gQy6J.png) \n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This is the standard diazotization reaction. A primary aromatic amine (Ar-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (Ar-N2+Cl-).\n    The product after this step is **4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n     ![](https://i.imgur.com/hX0YgC5.png) \n\n*   **Step 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt and warming causes the diazonium group (-N2+) to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas. This is a Sandmeyer-type reaction to produce a phenol.\n    The product after this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n     ![](https://i.imgur.com/Y1gM8vD.png) \n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This compound is an aldehyde with acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group), which are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** First, the base (OH-) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n        The product would be **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option D).\n         ![](https://i.imgur.com/gK2R83B.png) \n\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The term \"Heat\" is crucial. Heating the aldol addition product in the presence of base promotes the elimination of a molecule of water (dehydration). The acidic α-proton (on C-2) is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group (on C-3) leaves, forming a double bond between C-2 and C-3. This creates a highly stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new double bond is conjugated with both the carbonyl group and one of the aromatic rings.\n        The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n         ![](https://i.imgur.com/6D9TUnO.png) \n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction sequence converts 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. Because the reaction is heated, the final product is the dehydrated condensation product, not the simple addition product.\n\nMatching our derived final product, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal, with the given options:\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect substituents and double bond position.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure, not a dimerization product.\n*   C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** - This perfectly matches our derived final product.\n*   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which dehydrates upon heating.\n\nThus, the final product is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\n**1. Structure Determination of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\n*   **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula is CₐHₙNₓOᵧ. The DoU = a + 1 - (b-c)/2 = 8 + 1 - (9-1)/2 = 9 - 4 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (3 double bonds + 1 ring).\n    *   This leaves 1 degree of unsaturation, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), given the NMR data.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This high chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to an adjacent group with 2 equivalent protons (n+1 rule: 2+1=3), so a -CH₂- group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This represents a methylene (-CH₂) group. The splitting is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to a single proton (n+1 rule: 1+1=2). This confirms its coupling to the aldehyde proton. So we have the fragment **-CH₂-CHO**. The chemical shift of 3.66 ppm is consistent with a methylene group that is both benzylic (next to an aromatic ring) and alpha to a carbonyl.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The two doublets, each integrating to 2H, strongly indicate a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The chemical shifts, particularly the upfield signal at 6.51 ppm, suggest the ring is substituted with a strong electron-donating group.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons in this region is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂). An amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield aromatic signals.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is -NH₂.\n    *   The other substituent is the -CH₂CHO fragment.\n    *   This gives the structure **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n    *   Let's verify the formula: C = 6(ring)+2(chain) = 8. H = 4(ring)+2(amine)+2(CH₂)+1(CHO) = 9. N = 1. O = 1. The formula C₈H₉NO is correct.\n\n**2. Reaction Sequence Analysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO₂ + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    *   This is a standard diazotization reaction that converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt.\n    *   The -NH₂ group is converted to -N₂⁺Cl⁻.\n    *   **Product of Step 1:** 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H₂O (Hydrolysis)**\n    *   Heating a diazonium salt in water replaces the diazonium group (-N₂⁺) with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   **Product of Step 2:** 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    *   The product from step 2, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group).\n    *   A strong base (KOH) will deprotonate the α-carbon to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. This is a self-aldol reaction.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The initial product is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n        *   Structure: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option **A**.\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. This provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the β-hydroxy aldehyde. The acidic α-proton and the β-hydroxyl group are removed, forming a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        *   The final product is formed by dehydration of the addition product.\n        *   Let R = 4-hydroxyphenyl. The reaction is:\n            R-CH₂(α)-CHO + R-CH₂(α)-CHO --(KOH, Heat)--> R-CH₂-CH=C(R)-CHO + H₂O\n        *   **Final Product Structure:** 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal. This corresponds to option **D**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for the **final product** of the reaction sequence. The presence of \"Heat\" in the final step ensures that the aldol reaction proceeds through dehydration to the more thermodynamically stable conjugated system. Therefore, the aldol condensation product, not the simple addition product, is the final answer.\n\n*   The Aldol Addition Product is **A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**.\n*   The Aldol Condensation Product (after dehydration) is **D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThe final product is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product.\n\n### **Part 1: Identify the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the structure of the initial compound using its molecular formula and 1H-NMR data.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 typically indicates the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring (e.g., C=O, C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift (9-10 ppm) is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**. The splitting is a triplet (t), which means it's adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a CH2 group), according to the n+1 rule.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a signal for 2 protons. The splitting is a doublet (d), meaning it's adjacent to a carbon with 1 proton (a CH group). This confirms the presence of a **-CH2-CHO** fragment, as the CH2 protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield (less than 7 ppm), which indicates the ring is attached to an electron-donating group (EDG).\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet corresponds to 2 exchangeable protons. Given the nitrogen in the molecular formula, this is very likely a primary **amine group (-NH2)**. An amine group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    We have the following fragments:\n    *   A -CH2-CHO group\n    *   An -NH2 group\n    *   A benzene ring to which these two groups are attached in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\n    The structure of the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n     \n\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4(NH2)(CH2CHO) -> C = 6+2 = 8; H = 4+2+2+1 = 9; N=1; O=1. Formula C8H9NO is correct.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\nNow, we subject 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde to the given series of reactions.\n\n1.  **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O**\n    *   This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    *   **Step 1 (NaNO2 + HCl at 0-5°C): Diazotization.** The primary amine group (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The intermediate is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    *   **Step 2 (H2O, heat): Hydrolysis.** The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water to replace the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas.\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n     \n\n2.  **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves reacting the intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, with a strong base (KOH) and heat.\n    *   4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde with alpha-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group). Such aldehydes undergo an **aldol condensation** reaction in the presence of base and heat.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a. **Enolate Formation:** The base (OH⁻) removes an alpha-hydrogen from one molecule to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n        b. **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        c. **Aldol Addition:** Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives the aldol addition product, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option B).\n        d. **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **heat** promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. An alpha-hydrogen and the beta-hydroxyl group are removed to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n    *   **Final Product Formation:**\n        The aldol addition product dehydrates to form a double bond between the alpha (C2) and beta (C3) carbons.\n\n         \n\n        The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n### **Part 3: Match with Options**\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents and double bond position.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure; it's not a dimerization product.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This structure matches the final product of the aldol condensation reaction.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the given molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula for a saturated acyclic amine with 8 carbons would be C8H(2*8+2+1)N = C8H19N. The given formula is C8H9NO.\n    *   Difference in hydrogens = 19 - 9 = 10 hydrogens.\n    *   The oxygen is likely in a carbonyl group (C=O), which accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Degrees of unsaturation = (10 H / 2) - 1 (for C=O) = 5 - 1 = 4. (Or use the formula: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5).\n    *   A degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests a benzene ring (4 degrees) plus one other double bond or ring (likely a carbonyl C=O).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it's coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2), suggesting a -CH₂-CHO group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This corresponds to the -CH₂- group adjacent to the aldehyde. It's a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one proton (n+1=2, so n=1), which is the aldehyde proton. The coupling between the 9.72 ppm and 3.66 ppm signals is mutually consistent.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons in this region, combined with the presence of nitrogen in the formula, is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are an amino group (-NH₂) and a phenylacetaldehyde group (-CH₂-CHO).\n    *   Putting it together gives 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   Let's check if the formula matches: C₆H₄ (ring) + NH₂ + C₂H₃O (-CH₂CHO) = C₈H₉NO. The formula is correct.\n\n**The starting material is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.**\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction.\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO₂ + HCl**\n    This mixture generates nitrous acid (HONO) in situ. This is the standard reagent for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group is converted into a diazonium salt, -N₂⁺Cl⁻.\n    The product after this step is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    `[Cl⁻][⁺N≡N]-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO`\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H₂O**\n    Reacting an aromatic diazonium salt with water (often with gentle heating) results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas (N₂). This is a standard synthesis of phenols.\n    The intermediate product is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO`\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, possesses both an aldehyde group and acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH₂- group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH removes an acidic α-hydrogen from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO + OH⁻ ⇌ [HO-C₆H₄-CH-CHO]⁻ + H₂O`\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        This forms an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The structure of this product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option B).\n        Structure: `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂(C₄)-CH(OH)(C₃)-CH(C₆H₄OH)(C₂)-CHO(C₁)`\n    3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of \"Heat\" promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) and a hydrogen from the α-carbon (C2) are removed. This dehydration is highly favorable because it creates an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new C=C double bond is conjugated with the C=O group and the aromatic ring on C2, resulting in a very stable extended conjugated system.\n        The product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n        Structure: `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂(C₄)-CH(C₃)=C(C₆H₄OH)(C₂)-CHO(C₁)`\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product among the choices.**\n\nThe question asks for the **final product** of the entire sequence. The inclusion of \"Heat\" in the last step indicates that the reaction proceeds to the dehydrated condensation product, not stopping at the addition product.\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure (lacks hydroxyl groups).\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure, would not be formed from self-condensation.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed from the complete aldol condensation (addition followed by dehydration). This matches our derived final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\n**1. Deciphering the Starting Material (C8H9NO) from NMR Data**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula is C8H9NO. The DoU is calculated as C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 5. A DoU of 5 strongly indicates the presence of a benzene ring (4 DoU) and one other double bond or ring (1 DoU). The signals in the aromatic region (6-7 ppm) confirm the benzene ring.\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons, suggesting a -CH2-CHO group.\n    *   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are in the aromatic region.

Its chemical shift suggests it's a benzylic -CH2- group (a CH2 attached to the benzene ring). The doublet multiplicity means it is coupled to one adjacent proton. This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment, as this CH2 is coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are an amine group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2-CHO).\n    *   Let's check the formula: C6H4 (from the ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (from the side chain) = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n    *   The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.

The alpha-proton is removed, and the hydroxyl group on the beta-carbon leaves. This results in the formation of a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons.\n            *   `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO -> HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO + H2O`\n            *   The formation of this α,β-unsaturated aldehyde is thermodynamically favored because the new double bond is in conjugation with both the aldehyde's carbonyl group and one of the phenyl rings, creating a large, stable conjugated system.\n\n*   **Identifying the Final Product:**\n    *   The dehydrated product is named by identifying the main chain, which is a butenal (a four-carbon aldehyde with a double bond).\n    *   The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it's a but-2-enal.\n    *   There are two 4-hydroxyphenyl groups, one on C2 and one on C4.\n    *   Therefore, the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option B. Option C is the intermediate before the final dehydration step, which occurs due to the applied heat.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material, C8H9NO, from the 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation. The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which is suggested by the NMR data.\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Signals:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** The chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH2-) according to the n+1 rule (n=2 protons).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to a single adjacent proton (n=1). This coupling pattern (-CH2-CHO) is consistent with the aldehyde proton signal. Thus, we have a -CH2-CHO fragment (an ethanal group).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons and appearing as doublets, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons in this region is typical for a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to quadrupolar coupling with nitrogen and/or chemical exchange.\n\n*   **Assemble the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO) as substituents. Putting them together gives the structure 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal, also known as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: The benzene ring is C6H4. The substituents are -NH2 and -CH2CHO. Total formula = C6H4 + NH2 + C2H3O = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO. This matches the given molecular formula.\n\n    The starting material is:\n    ```\n        NH2\n         |\n        / \\\n       || ||\n       \\\\ //\n        |\n      CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This reagent mixture is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged. The product is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    ```\n      Cl- +N2\n         |\n        / \\\n       || ||\n       \\\\ //\n        |\n      CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    Diazonium salts are unstable and, upon warming in water, undergo hydrolysis. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) from the water. This reaction converts the diazonium salt into a phenol. The product is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    ```\n        OH\n         |\n        / \\\n       || ||\n       \\\\ //\n        |\n      CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. The starting material for this step is an aldehyde with acidic protons on the alpha-carbon (the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for a self-aldol condensation reaction.\n\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes a proton from the α-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n    ```\n                             OH\n                             |\n    HO-Ph-CH2-CHO   +   HO-Ph-CH2-CHO    --->    HO-Ph-CH2-CH - CH - Ph-OH\n          (Ph = C6H4)                                      |    |\n                                                         OH   CHO\n    ```\n    This intermediate is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal.\n\n    3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The proton on the α-carbon (C2) is acidic and is removed by the base, and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) is eliminated. This forms a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new double bond is conjugated with both the carbonyl group and one of the aromatic rings.\n    ```\n       OH                           CHO\n       |                             |\n    HO-Ph-CH2-CH - CH - Ph-OH     --->    HO-Ph-CH2-CH=C-Ph-OH   +   H2O\n                 |    |\n               OH   CHO\n    ```\n    The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product expected under heat.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: This has an incorrect molecular formula and structure.\n*   C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**: This name correctly describes the structure of the final product derived from the aldol condensation.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: This has incorrect substituents (phenyl instead of hydroxyphenyl) and the wrong position for the double bond.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Structure of the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional degree of unsaturation (a double bond or another ring).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). A triplet (t) indicates that it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1 rule), which implies a -CH2- group is next to it. So, we have a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to rapid proton exchange and quadrupolar relaxation.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH2 group. A doublet (d) indicates it's coupled to one adjacent proton, which is consistent with the aldehyde proton in the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n    *   Let's check if the formula matches: C6H4 (from the ring) + NH2 + C2H3O = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO.

This is a standard method to synthesize phenols.\n\n    The intermediate product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    ```\n         HO-Ph-CH2-CHO  (where Ph is a 1,4-phenylene group)\n    ```\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   We are now treating an aldehyde (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) that possesses α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group) with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate ion.\n        b.  **Nucleophilic Attack (Aldol Addition):** The enolate ion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product.\n            The structure of the aldol addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n            ```\n                                    CHO\n                                    |\n            HO-Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH-Ph-OH\n            ```\n        c.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **heat** promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product.

Given the presence of nitrogen in the molecular formula (C8H9**N**O), this signal corresponds to a primary amino group (-NH2).\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** This signal far downfield is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity (t) indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-) according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet multiplicity (d) indicates it is adjacent to a single proton (n+1 rule, 1+1=2 peaks), which confirms it's coupled to the aldehyde proton. Thus, we have a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n\n*   **Assemble the structure:**\n    We have the following fragments: a para-disubstituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group. Assembling these gives **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify the formula: C6H4 (ring) + C (from CH2) + C (from CHO) + NH2 + H (from CH2) + H (from CHO) gives C8H9NO.

This corresponds to option **B**.\n\nSince the reaction conditions include heat, the reaction will not stop at the aldol addition stage (product D) but will proceed to the more thermodynamically stable condensation product (product B), which benefits from extended conjugation between the phenyl ring, the C=C double bond, and the C=O double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product of the entire reaction sequence is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the given NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1. For C8H9NO, DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.

This suggests a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region (6.5-8.0 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicate a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons in this region, coupled with the presence of nitrogen in the formula, is typical for a primary **amine group (-NH2)**.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A signal for 2 protons, appearing as a doublet (d), means it is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This is consistent with a **-CH2- group** coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   We have the fragments: a para-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4), an amine group (-NH2), a methylene group (-CH2-), and an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n    *   Let's combine them: C6H4 + NH2 + CH2 + CHO = C8H9NO. This perfectly matches the molecular formula.\n    *   The coupling confirms the `-CH2-CHO` unit (aldehyde proton is a triplet, methylene protons are a doublet).\n    *   The two substituents on the benzene ring must be -NH2 and -CH2-CHO, in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n    *   Therefore, the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Part 2: Analyzing the Reaction Sequence**\n\nNow, we will trace the starting material through the given series of reactions.\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    *   This is the standard set of reagents for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   **Intermediate Product 1:** 4-(diazonium)phenylacetaldehyde chloride.\n        Structure: [Cl-][N2+]-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    *   Adding water and warming the diazonium salt solution causes hydrolysis. The -N2+ group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from the water.\n    *   **Intermediate Product 2:** 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        Structure: HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    *   The conditions are a strong base (KOH), an aldehyde with α-protons (the CH2 group in 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is alpha to the carbonyl), and heat. These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**. This is a self-condensation reaction since only one type of aldehyde is present.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        3.  **Protonation:** An acid-base reaction with water yields the **aldol adduct**.\n            The structure of the aldol adduct is: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. (This corresponds to option A).\n            Chain numbering: (HO-C6H4)-CH2(4)-CH(OH)(3)-CH(C6H4-OH)(2)-CHO(1)\n        4.  **Dehydration:** The keyword \"Heat\" indicates that the reaction does not stop at the aldol adduct. The adduct undergoes dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated system. The base removes the proton from the α-carbon (C2) and the -OH group leaves from the β-carbon (C3), forming a double bond between them.\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        Structure: (HO-C6H4)-CH2(4)-CH(3)=C(C6H4-OH)(2)-CHO(1)\n        Name: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Part 3: Matching with Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal:** This is the aldol adduct, which is an intermediate. It is not the final product because the reaction is heated.\n*   **B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal:** Incorrect substituents (phenyl instead of hydroxyphenyl) and incorrect double bond position.\n*   **C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This perfectly matches the structure derived for the final condensation product.\n*   **D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal:** Incorrect structure and stoichiometry. This is not a product of self-condensation.\n\nThe final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\n*   **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the provided 1H-NMR data.**\n\n    1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n        The formula for DoU is `C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`.\n        DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n        A DoU of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (DoU=4) and one additional double bond or ring (DoU=1).\n\n    2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR Signals:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly indicative of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n=2, from the n+1 rule). This suggests a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) in this region, integrating to 2H, is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH2). The broadness is due to quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom and/or chemical exchange.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons. This corresponds to the -CH2- group we inferred from the aldehyde signal. The doublet splitting confirms it is coupled to a single proton (the -CHO proton). The chemical shift is consistent with a methylene group attached to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.\n\n    3.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n        We have the following fragments: a para-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4), an amine group (-NH2), and an ethanal group (-CH2CHO).\n        Assembling these pieces gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde** (also named (4-aminophenyl)ethanal).\n        Let's verify this structure:\n        *   Molecular formula: C8H9NO (C6H4 + CH2 + CHO + NH2 = C8H9NO). Correct.\n        *   DoU: Benzene ring (4) + carbonyl C=O (1) = 5. Correct.\n        *   NMR consistency: The activating -NH2 group pushes the ortho protons upfield (6.51 ppm), while the deactivating -CH2CHO group shifts its ortho protons downfield (6.98 ppm). The splitting patterns of the -CH2CHO group (triplet for CHO, doublet for CH2) are also consistent.\n        *   The starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n    1.  **NaNO2 + HCl:** This is a diazotization reaction. It converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n        *   Starting Material: 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n        *   Product after step 1: 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride\n\n    2.  **H2O:** The diazonium salt is then treated with water. Warming an aqueous solution of a diazonium salt leads to hydrolysis, where the -N2+ group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas.\n        *   Product after step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**\n\n    3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. The starting molecule has an aldehyde group and acidic α-hydrogens (on the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction. Since there is only one type of molecule, this will be a self-condensation.\n        *   **Mechanism:**\n            a.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n            b.  **Nucleophilic Attack (Addition):** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n            c.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated, yielding a β-hydroxy aldehyde, the aldol addition product.\n                The structure of the aldol addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (B).\n            d.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. The heat provides the energy to eliminate a molecule of water from the aldol addition product. The elimination is strongly favored because it creates a new C=C double bond that is conjugated with the aldehyde's carbonyl group and a phenyl ring, resulting in a very stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde system. The H is removed from the α-carbon (C2) and the OH from the β-carbon (C3).\n\n        *   **Final Product Identification:**\n            *   Aldol addition product (from b,c): 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (This is structure B)\n            *   Dehydration product (from d): **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** (This is structure C)\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclusion.**\n\n    The question asks for the final product of the reaction sequence, which includes heat in the last step. The heat drives the reaction to completion, favoring the formation of the more stable, dehydrated aldol condensation product over the simple addition product. Therefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n    Comparing this to the options:\n    A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect, missing the hydroxyl groups.\n    B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final condensation product formed under heat.\n    C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the correct α,β-unsaturated final product from the aldol condensation.\n    D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure; it's not a dimerization product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
