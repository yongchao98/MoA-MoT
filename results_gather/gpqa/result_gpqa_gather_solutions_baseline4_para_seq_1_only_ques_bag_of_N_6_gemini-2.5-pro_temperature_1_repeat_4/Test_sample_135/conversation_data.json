Define the Vector Field and the Volume**\n\n*   **Vector Field (f):** The problem states that the field `f(r)` has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and points radially outwards from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this is written as:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n    where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n*   **Volume (V):** The volume is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**2. Apply the Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) provides a way to relate a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the flux. The theorem states:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V`. In our case, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\nThis approach is generally simpler than calculating the divergence directly, especially when dealing with singularities, as is the case here (the field is undefined at `r = 0`).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Surface Integral (Flux)**\n\nWe need to calculate the flux `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   **Field on the Surface (f(R)):** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n\n*   **Differential Surface Element (dS):** For a sphere of radius `R`, the differential area element `dS` in spherical coordinates, pointing in the outward radial direction, is:\n    `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat`\n    where `θ` is the polar angle and `φ` is the azimuthal angle.\n\n*   **Dot Product (f ⋅ dS):** Now, we take the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the dot product simplifies significantly. The `R^2` terms cancel out:\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n\n*   **Integration:** To find the total flux, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for `θ` are from `0` to `π`, and for `φ` are from `0` to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_(φ=0)^(2π) ∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    Let's evaluate the integral in steps:\n    1.  Integrate with respect to `θ`:\n        `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    2.  Integrate the result with respect to `φ`:\n        `∫_0^(2π) 2 dφ = [2φ]_0^(2π) = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe value of the surface integral is `4π`. According to the Divergence Theorem, this is also the value of the original volume integral.\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis result is a fundamental concept in physics (related to Gauss's Law for electric fields), representing the strength of the source at the origin.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4 π\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to compute the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n*   The vector field is given as `f(r)`. It has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and points radially outward from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n*   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**2. Method 1: Direct Calculation of the Divergence**\n\nFirst, let's try to calculate the divergence of `f`, denoted as `∇ ⋅ f`.\nIn spherical coordinates, the formula for the divergence of a vector field `f = f_r * r_hat + f_θ * θ_hat + f_φ * φ_hat` is:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + (1/(r*sinθ)) * ∂(f_θ * sinθ)/∂θ + (1/(r*sinθ)) * ∂f_φ/∂φ`\n\nFor our given field, `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, we have:\n*   `f_r = 1/r^2`\n*   `f_θ = 0`\n*   `f_φ = 0`\n\nSubstituting these into the divergence formula:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r + 0 + 0`\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r`\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`\n\nThis calculation shows that the divergence is zero. If we naively integrate this over the volume, we would get `∫_V (0) dV = 0`.\n\n**3. The Singularity at the Origin**\n\nHowever, there is a critical issue. The vector field `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat` is undefined (singular) at the origin (`r = 0`). Our calculation `∇ ⋅ f = 0` is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. Since the volume of integration (a sphere centered at the origin) includes this singularity, we cannot simply conclude the integral is zero.\n\nThis situation (a `1/r^2` radial field) is classic in physics, for example, the electric field of a point charge or the gravitational field of a point mass. The divergence at the origin is not zero; it is a source point represented by a Dirac delta function.\n\nTo properly handle this singularity, we should use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem).\n\n**4. Method 2: Using the Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that bounds the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere:\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `dS` is the differential surface area vector, which points outward from the surface.\n\nLet's evaluate the surface integral (the right-hand side of the theorem).\n\n*   **The vector field `f` on the surface `S`:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, `f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   **The surface element `dS`:** For a spherical surface, the differential area element is `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`. The direction is radially outward, so the vector is `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`.\n*   **The dot product `f ⋅ dS`:**\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat]`\n    The `R^2` terms cancel out. Since `r_hat` is a unit vector, `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`.\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nNow we integrate this over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for spherical coordinates are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_0^(2π) ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nWe can separate the integrals:\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (∫_0^(2π) dφ) * (∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ)`\n\nLet's evaluate each integral:\n*   `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n*   `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nMultiplying the results:\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this surface integral.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis result shows that although the divergence is zero everywhere except the origin, the contribution from the singularity at the origin is `4π`.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 1\nD) 4 π\n\nThe calculated value `4π` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`.\n*   **Vector Field (f):** The field has a magnitude `f(r) = 1/r^2` and points radially outwards from the origin. In vector notation, using spherical coordinates, this is `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n*   **Volume (V):** The integration is over the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n*   **Integral:** We need to calculate `I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n**2. Choose the Method: The Divergence Theorem**\n\nDirectly calculating the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` and then integrating over the volume can be problematic. Let's see why:\nThe formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r` (since `f_θ` and `f_φ` are zero).\nHere, `f_r = 1/r^2`.\nSo, `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`.\nIf we naively integrate this, we get `∫_V 0 dV = 0`. However, this is incorrect because the vector field `f` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), and the formula for divergence is not valid there. The divergence is actually a Dirac delta function at the origin.\n\nA more robust method is to use the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a field to the flux of the field through the closed surface that bounds the volume:\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere:\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `dS` is the differential surface area vector, which points outward from the surface.\n\nThis method works because the surface `S` is at `r=R`, where the field is well-behaved (not singular). The surface integral correctly accounts for the effect of the singularity inside the volume.\n\n**3. Apply the Divergence Theorem**\n\nWe need to calculate the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   **Field on the surface (f):** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is `f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n\n*   **Surface element (dS):** For a sphere of radius `R`, the differential surface area element in spherical coordinates is `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`. The direction of this area element is normal to the surface, which is the radial direction. So, the vector `dS` is `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat`.\n\n*   **Dot Product (f ⋅ dS):** Now we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element.\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat ]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n\n*   **Integrate over the surface:** We integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the spherical angles are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n**4. Evaluate the Integral**\n\nWe evaluate the integral in two steps:\n1.  **Inner integral (with respect to θ):**\n    `∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_{0}^{π}`\n    `= -cos(π) - (-cos(0))`\n    `= -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n2.  **Outer integral (with respect to φ):**\n    `∫_{φ=0}^{2π} 2 dφ = 2 * [φ]_{0}^{2π}`\n    `= 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nBy the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere (as long as `R > 0`).

Define the Vector Field**\nThe problem states that the vector field `f(r)` has a magnitude `|f(r)| = 1/r^2` and is directed radially. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n**2. The Integral to Evaluate**\nWe need to compute the volume integral of the divergence of `f` over a sphere `V` of radius `R` centered at the origin:\n`Integral = ∫_V (∇ . f) dV`\n\n**3. Applying the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)**\nThe Divergence Theorem provides a powerful way to solve this problem. It relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the surface integral of the flux of the field through the boundary surface `S` of the volume `V`:\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV = ∮_S (f . n_hat) dS`\n\n*   **Volume V**: A sphere of radius R.\n*   **Surface S**: The surface of the sphere of radius R.\n*   **Outward unit normal vector n_hat**: For a sphere centered at the origin, the outward normal vector at any point on the surface is simply the radial unit vector, `n_hat = r_hat`.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Surface Integral**\nLet's compute the dot product `f . n_hat` on the surface `S`:\nOn the surface of the sphere, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n`f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n`n_hat = r_hat`\nTherefore, the dot product is:\n`f . n_hat = ((1/R^2) * r_hat) . r_hat = 1/R^2 * (r_hat . r_hat) = 1/R^2` (since `r_hat . r_hat = 1`)\n\nNow, substitute this into the surface integral:\n`∮_S (f . n_hat) dS = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n\nSince `R` is a constant radius, `1/R^2` is constant over the entire surface `S` and can be taken out of the integral:\n`Integral = (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n\nThe integral `∮_S dS` is simply the total surface area of the sphere. The surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n\n`Integral = (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n`Integral = 4π`\n\n**Alternative Consideration: Direct Calculation of Divergence**\nIf we calculate the divergence of `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat` in spherical coordinates, we find that `∇ . f = 0` for all `r ≠ 0`. However, the field `f` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), and the divergence at this point is undefined in the classical sense. The Divergence Theorem correctly handles this singularity by relating the integral to the flux through the enclosing surface. The non-zero result indicates that there is a \"source\" at the origin, and the divergence is actually a Dirac delta function: `∇ . (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ^3(r)`. Integrating this over a volume containing the origin gives `4π`.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe value of the integral is `4π`.

The integral is represented as `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n2.  **Define the Vector Field:**\n    *   The magnitude of the field is given as `f(r) = 1/r^2`.\n    *   The field has a non-zero component only along the radial direction. This means the field points directly away from (or towards) the origin. Assuming it points outward, the vector field `f` in spherical coordinates is:\n        `f = (1/r^2) * r̂`\n        where `r` is the radial distance and `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n3.  **Define the Volume of Integration:**\n    *   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n4.  **Choose the Method of Solution:**\n    We need to evaluate `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`. There are two main approaches:\n    a)  **Direct Calculation:** First, compute the divergence `∇ ⋅ f`, and then integrate the result over the volume `V`.\n    b)  **Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem):** This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a field to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume `V`. The theorem states:\n        `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\n5.  **Critique the Methods:**\n    *   **Method (a):** Let's try to calculate the divergence of `f` in spherical coordinates. The divergence formula is `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + ...` (other terms are zero since `f_θ` and `f_φ` are zero). Here, `f_r = 1/r^2`.\n        `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`.\n        If the divergence is zero everywhere, the integral would be zero. **However, this is a classic trap.** The field `f = 1/r^2` is singular (undefined) at the origin (`r=0`). The formula for divergence we used is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. The origin is a point source, and the divergence is actually a Dirac delta function at that point. To avoid the complexity of delta functions, the Divergence Theorem is a much safer and more elegant approach.\n\n    *   **Method (b):** Using the Divergence Theorem is ideal because it avoids the singularity at `r=0` by performing the calculation on the surface of the sphere, where `r=R` and the field is well-behaved.\n\n6.  **Executing the Divergence Theorem:**\n    We need to calculate the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n    *   **Surface `S`:** A sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   **Vector Field `f` on the surface:** On the surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, `f = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n    *   **Differential Surface Element `dS`:** For a sphere, the differential area element `dS` always points radially outward. So, its direction is `r̂`. Its magnitude in spherical coordinates is `R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. Therefore, the vector is:\n        `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`.\n    *   **Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`:** Now we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element.\n        `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [(R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂]`\n        Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the expression simplifies significantly:\n        `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2) * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n        Notice that the dependence on the radius `R` has canceled out.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Integral:**\n    Now we integrate `sin(θ) dθ dφ` over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_(φ=0)^(2π) ∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    We can separate the integrals since the integrand does not depend on `φ`:\n    `= (∫_0^(2π) dφ) * (∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ)`\n\n    *   **First integral (φ):** `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π - 0 = 2π`.\n    *   **Second integral (θ):** `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n    Multiplying the results:\n    `Result = (2π) * (2) = 4π`.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of `f` is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`.\n\n9.  **Verification with Code:**\n    The Python code provided in the thinking process calculates the core of the surface integral: `(∫_0^(2π) dφ) * (∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ)`.\n    The code output `12.566370614359172` is the numerical value of `4 * π` (since `π ≈ 3.14159`). This confirms the analytical result.\n\n10. **Final Answer Check:**\n    The result of the integral is `4π`.

Evaluate the Surface Integral**\n\nLet's evaluate the right-hand side of the theorem, `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   **Step 4.1: Define the field `f` on the surface `S`.**\n    On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`.

Understand the Problem\nWe are asked to compute the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`.\nThe integral is `I = ∫∫∫_V (∇.f) dV`.\n\n### 2. Define the Vector Field and the Volume\n*   **Vector Field `f`**: The field has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and points radially outward from the origin. In spherical coordinates `(r, θ, φ)`, this can be written as:\n    `f(r, θ, φ) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\n    where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction. The field only has a radial component, `f_r = 1/r^2`, while `f_θ = 0` and `f_φ = 0`.\n\n*   **Volume `V`**: The volume is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin. The surface enclosing this volume, `S`, is the surface of this sphere.\n\n### 3. Choose a Method for Evaluation\nWe have two primary methods to solve this:\n1.  **Direct Calculation**: First compute the divergence `∇.f` and then integrate it over the volume `V`.\n2.  **Divergence Theorem**: Use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's theorem) to convert the volume integral into a surface integral.\n\nThe vector field `f = (1/r^2) * r̂` is singular at the origin `r = 0`. This can make direct evaluation of the volume integral tricky. The Divergence Theorem is often simpler in such cases because it moves the calculation to the boundary surface, avoiding the singularity inside. We will use the Divergence Theorem.\n\n### 4. Apply the Divergence Theorem\nThe Divergence Theorem states:\n`∫∫∫_V (∇.f) dV = ∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nwhere `S` is the closed surface enclosing the volume `V`, and `dS` is the outward-pointing differential surface area vector.\n\n### 5. Evaluate the Surface Integral\n*   **Surface `S`**: The surface is a sphere of radius `R`. On this surface, the radial coordinate `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n\n*   **Vector Field on the Surface**: We evaluate `f` on the surface `S` (where `r=R`):\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n\n*   **Differential Surface Area `dS`**: For a sphere, the differential surface area element in spherical coordinates is `dS = r^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. The direction of the surface element vector `dS` is the outward normal, which is the radial direction `r̂`. So:\n    `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ * r̂`\n\n*   **Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`**: Now we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r̂ ] ⋅ [ R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ * r̂ ]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n*   **Integrate over the Surface `S`**: The surface integral is performed over the entire sphere, so the limits of integration are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    `∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫[from φ=0 to 2π] ∫[from θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    `∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ( ∫[from φ=0 to 2π] dφ ) * ( ∫[from θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ )`\n\n    Evaluate each integral:\n    1.  `∫[from φ=0 to 2π] dφ = [φ]` from 0 to 2π `= 2π - 0 = 2π`\n    2.  `∫[from θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]` from 0 to π `= -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    Multiply the results:\n    `∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n### 6. Conclusion\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of the field is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n`∫∫∫_V (∇.f) dV = 4π`\n\n### Alternative Method (Briefly)\nOne could also calculate the divergence directly. The divergence of `f = (1/r^2) * r̂` is `∇.f = 0` for `r ≠ 0`. However, at the origin `r = 0`, the field is infinite, and the divergence is a Dirac delta function: `∇⋅(r̂/r²) = 4πδ³(r)`.\nThe volume integral becomes:\n`∫∫∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV`\nSince the volume (a sphere of radius R) includes the origin, the integral of the delta function over this volume is 1.\n`∫∫∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π`\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe final answer is `4π`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 4 π\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 0\nD) 1\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe problem asks for the evaluation of the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n**1. Define the Vector Field**\nThe vector field `f(r)` has a magnitude that falls off as `1/r^2` and is directed radially outward from the origin. In spherical coordinates, we can write this vector field as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n**2. Apply the Divergence Theorem**\nThe Divergence Theorem provides a powerful way to solve this problem. It states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the surface integral of the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that bounds the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nThis is particularly useful here because the field `f` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), which is inside the volume of integration. By converting to a surface integral, we perform the calculation on the surface of the sphere where `r=R`, and the field is well-behaved.\n\n**3. Set up the Surface Integral**\n*   **Surface (S):** The surface is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n*   **Vector Field on the Surface (f):** On the surface of this sphere, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is:\n    `f(r=R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n*   **Differential Surface Area Vector (dS):** For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` always points in the radially outward direction, which is the same direction as `r_hat`. The magnitude of `dS` in spherical coordinates is `R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. Therefore, the vector `dS` is:\n    `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`\n*   **Dot Product (f ⋅ dS):** Now we compute the dot product of the field `f` and the surface element `dS`:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat ]`\n    Since the dot product of a unit vector with itself is one (`r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`), the expression simplifies significantly. The `R^2` terms cancel out:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n**4. Evaluate the Integral**\nThe final step is to integrate this result over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are `θ` from 0 to `π` and `φ` from 0 to `2π`:\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_(φ=0)^(2π) ∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nWe can solve this by integrating with respect to `θ` first:\n`∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nNow, we integrate this result with respect to `φ`:\n`∫_0^(2π) 2 dφ = [2φ]_0^(2π) = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe value of the volume integral of the divergence of the field is `4π`. This result corresponds to option D.\n\n(Note: An alternative method involves directly calculating the divergence `∇ ⋅ f`. For `r ≠ 0`, `∇ ⋅ f = 0`. At `r = 0`, the divergence is a Dirac delta function, `∇ ⋅ (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ^3(r)`. Integrating `4πδ^3(r)` over a volume containing the origin also yields `4π`, confirming the result from the Divergence Theorem.)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1.

While this means the conditions for the Divergence Theorem are not strictly met *at that single point*, the theorem can still be used. The physical interpretation is that the total \"source strength\" (the volume integral of the divergence) inside a volume is equal to the total \"flow\" (flux) out of its boundary surface. The singularity at the origin acts as a point source.\n\n**3. Set up the Surface Integral**\n\nWe will calculate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, which is the surface integral (the flux) over the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n*   **The Surface (S):** The surface is a sphere of constant radius `r = R`.\n*   **The Vector Field on the Surface (f):** On this surface, the vector field is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   **The Differential Surface Element (dS):** For a sphere, the differential surface element vector `dS` points radially outward. Its magnitude is the area of a small patch on the surface. In spherical coordinates, this is `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Dot Product `f · dS`**\n\nNow, we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n`f · dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] · [ (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat ]`\n\nThe dot product of the unit vector with itself is `r_hat · r_hat = 1`. The `R^2` terms cancel out:\n`f · dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ * (r_hat · r_hat)`\n`f · dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n**5. Evaluate the Surface Integral**\n\nNow we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere in spherical coordinates are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f · dS) = ∫_φ=0^(2π) ∫_θ=0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nWe can separate the integrals:\n`= ( ∫_0^(2π) dφ ) * ( ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ )`\n\nEvaluate each integral:\n*   `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n*   `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nMultiply the results:\n`∮_S (f · dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n**6.

Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`.\n*   The vector field is given by `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction. The magnitude of the field is `1/r^2`, and it points radially outward.\n*   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n*   The integral to evaluate is `I = ∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n**2. Method 1: Direct Calculation of the Divergence**\n\nLet's first attempt to calculate the divergence of `f` directly using the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + (1/(r*sin(θ))) * ∂(sin(θ) * f_θ)/∂θ + (1/(r*sin(θ))) * ∂(f_φ)/∂φ`\n\nFor our field, `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, the components are:\n*   `f_r = 1/r^2`\n*   `f_θ = 0`\n*   `f_φ = 0`\n\nSubstituting these into the divergence formula:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r + 0 + 0`\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r`\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`\n\nThis calculation suggests that the divergence is zero. If we naively integrate this over the volume, we would get `∫∫∫_V (0) dV = 0`.\n\n**3. The Singularity at the Origin**\n\nThere is a crucial detail to consider. The vector field `f(r) = 1/r^2` is undefined (singular) at the origin (`r = 0`). Our calculation of the divergence is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. Therefore, the divergence is zero everywhere *except* at the origin. This type of problem, with a singularity at a single point, is a classic case for applying the Divergence Theorem.\n\nIn physics, the divergence of this specific field is known to be a Dirac delta function: `∇ ⋅ (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`, where `δ³(r)` is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function, which is zero everywhere except at `r=0`. Integrating this would give `∫∫∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV = 4π`, since the origin is inside our volume of integration.\n\nLet's verify this result using the more general Divergence Theorem.\n\n**4. Method 2: Using the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface that encloses the volume:\n`∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `f` is our vector field.\n*   `dS` is the differential surface area element vector, which points outward, normal to the surface.\n\nLet's evaluate the surface integral (the right-hand side):\n\n*   **On the surface `S`:** The radius is constant, `r = R`. So the vector field on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   **The surface element `dS`:** For a sphere, the surface element vector `dS` points in the radial direction, so `dS = dS * r_hat`. In spherical coordinates, the magnitude of the surface element is `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. Therefore, `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ * r_hat`.\n*   **The dot product `f ⋅ dS`:**\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ * r_hat]`\n    The `R^2` terms cancel out, and `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`.\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n*   **The surface integral:** Now we integrate this over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for `θ` are 0 to `π`, and for `φ` are 0 to `2π`.\n    `∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    Let's evaluate the inner integral with respect to `θ`:\n    `∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)](from 0 to π) = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    Now, substitute this back into the outer integral with respect to `φ`:\n    `∫(from 0 to 2π) 2 dφ = [2φ](from 0 to 2π) = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\n**5.

This form strongly suggests the use of the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The Divergence Theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the net flux of the field through the closed surface that encloses the volume. The theorem is stated as:\n    ∫_V (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮_S (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n    Where:\n    *   V is the volume.\n    *   S is the closed surface enclosing the volume V.\n    *   **f** is the vector field.\n    *   ∇ ⋅ **f** is the divergence of the vector field.\n    *   d**S** is the outward-pointing differential surface area vector.\n\n2.  **Define the vector field and the surface:**\n    *   **Vector Field (f):** The problem states that the field has a magnitude of 1/r² and is directed radially. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n        **f** = (1/r²) **r̂**\n        where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   **Volume (V) and Surface (S):** The volume is a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The enclosing surface S is the surface of this sphere.\n\n3.  **Set up the surface integral:**\n    To use the Divergence Theorem, we need to calculate the surface integral ∮_S (**f** ⋅ d**S**).\n    *   First, we evaluate the vector field **f** on the surface S. On the surface of the sphere, the radius r is constant and equal to R.

Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given a vector field `f` that is radial and has a magnitude that falls off as `1/r^2`. This can be written in spherical coordinates as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\nwhere `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nWe need to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`, over a volume `V` which is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**2. Choose a Method: The Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) is the most suitable tool for this problem. It states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume:\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n**Important Note:** The vector field `f` has a singularity at the origin (`r=0`), where its magnitude becomes infinite. Strictly speaking, the Divergence Theorem requires the field to be continuously differentiable everywhere inside the volume. However, we can still use the theorem by understanding that the singularity at the origin acts as a \"source\" of the field.

Understanding the Problem\n\nWe are given a vector field `f(r)` with the following properties:\n*   Its magnitude is `|f(r)| = 1/r^2`, where `r` is the radial distance from the origin.\n*   Its direction is purely radial, pointing away from the origin.\n\nIn spherical coordinates `(r, θ, φ)`, this vector field can be written as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nWe need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∫_V (∇ . f) dV`, where `V` is the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n### 2. Method 1: Direct Calculation of the Divergence\n\nFirst, let's try to calculate the divergence `∇ . f`. The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is:\n`∇ . f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + (1/(r*sin(θ))) * ∂(f_θ * sin(θ))/∂θ + (1/(r*sin(θ))) * ∂(f_φ)/∂φ`\n\nFor our field `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, the components are:\n*   `f_r = 1/r^2`\n*   `f_θ = 0`\n*   `f_φ = 0`\n\nSubstituting these into the divergence formula:\n`∇ . f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r + 0 + 0`\n`∇ . f = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r`\n`∇ . f = (1/r^2) * 0`\n`∇ . f = 0`\n\nThis calculation seems to suggest that the divergence is zero everywhere. If this were true, the volume integral `∫_V (0) dV` would also be zero.\n\n**However, there is a critical point to consider:** The vector field `f(r) = 1/r^2` is undefined at the origin (`r = 0`). The calculation above is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. The origin is a singularity, and we cannot ignore it because it is inside our volume of integration.\n\n### 3. Method 2: Using the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)\n\nA more robust way to solve this problem, especially when singularities are involved, is to use the Divergence Theorem. The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume:\n\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n*   **Volume `V`**: A sphere of radius `R`.\n*   **Surface `S`**: The spherical surface of radius `R`.\n*   **Vector Field `f`**: On the surface `S`, `r = R`, so `f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   **Surface Element `dS`**: The differential surface vector `dS` is a vector whose magnitude is the area of the surface element and whose direction is the outward-pointing normal. For a sphere, the outward normal is always in the radial direction, so `n_hat = r_hat`. The magnitude of the surface element in spherical coordinates is `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`. Therefore, `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`.\n\nNow, we calculate the dot product `f . dS`:\n`f . dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] . [ (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat ]`\nSince `r_hat . r_hat = 1`:\n`f . dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ)`\n`f . dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nNext, we integrate this over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f . dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nLet's evaluate the integral:\n1.  Integrate with respect to `θ`:\n    `∫_{0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_{0}^{π} = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n2.  Integrate the result with respect to `φ`:\n    `∫_{φ=0}^{2π} 2 dφ = 2 * [φ]_{0}^{2π} = 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π`\n\nThus, the value of the integral is `4π`.\n\n### 4. Reconciling the Methods and Conclusion\n\nThe Divergence Theorem gives the answer `4π`, while the direct calculation of the divergence (which was flawed because it ignored the singularity) suggested `0`. The correct approach is using the Divergence Theorem, which properly handles the \"source\" at the origin by converting the volume integral into a surface integral where the field is well-behaved.\n\nThis problem is a classic example from physics, analogous to Gauss's Law for a point charge at the origin. The divergence of the field `r_hat / r^2` is actually a Dirac delta function, `∇ . (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ(r)`, which is zero everywhere except at the origin, but its integral over any volume containing the origin is `4π`.\n\nThe result `4π` is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere (as long as `R > 0`), which makes physical sense: the total \"source strength\" is contained at the origin, so any sphere enclosing it should measure the same total flux.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 4 π\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 0\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Vector Field and the Volume:**\n    *   The vector field is given by its magnitude `f(r) = 1/r^2` and its direction, which is purely radial.

The theorem states: `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`. This converts a volume integral into a surface integral over the boundary surface `S` of the volume `V`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Divergence Directly (and why it's tricky):**\n*   The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r`.\n*   Here, the radial component `f_r` is `1/r^2`.\n*   So, `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`.\n*   This result `∇ ⋅ f = 0` is valid for all `r ≠ 0`. However, at the origin (`r = 0`), the field `f(r)` is singular (1/0 is undefined). The divergence is not zero at this point; it is a Dirac delta function. A naive integration of `0` over the volume would incorrectly yield `0`. The Divergence Theorem elegantly handles this singularity.\n\n**3. Apply the Divergence Theorem:**\n*   The volume integral `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV` is equal to the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n*   **Surface `S`:** The surface is the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   **Vector Field `f` on the surface `S`:** At any point on the surface, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, `f = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n*   **Differential Surface Element `dS`:** For a sphere, the area element `dS` points radially outward. Its magnitude is `R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`. As a vector, `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r̂`.\n*   **Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`:** Now we compute the dot product to find the flux through the differential area element.\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [(R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r̂]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`.\n    Notice how the `R^2` terms cancel out, making the result independent of the sphere's radius `R`.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Surface Integral:**\n*   We need to integrate `sin(θ) dθ dφ` over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_0^(2π) ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n*   The integral is separable:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (∫_0^(2π) dφ) * (∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ)`\n*   Evaluate each part:\n    *   `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π - 0 = 2π`.\n    *   `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n*   Multiply the results:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n*   By the Divergence Theorem, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = 4π`.\n*   This result is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism (Gauss's Law for a point charge). The field described is analogous to the electric field of a point charge at the origin.\n*   Comparing the result `4π` with the given options:\n    A) 1\n    B) 4 π\n    C) 4/3 π R\n    D) 0\n*   The most appropriate answer is B.\n\nThe reasoning is complete and the result is confirmed by standard physics principles. No further calculation or search is needed.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThis problem asks for the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n**1. The Vector Field and the Integral**\n\nThe vector field is given by its magnitude `f(r) = 1/r^2` and its direction, which is purely radial. In spherical coordinates, this is expressed as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\nwhere `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nThe volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**2. Choosing the Right Method: The Divergence Theorem**\n\nWe need to calculate `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` gives `0` for all `r ≠ 0`. However, at the origin (`r = 0`), the field is infinite (a singularity), and the divergence is undefined. Since the integration volume includes this singularity, we cannot simply conclude the integral is `0`.\n\nThe most appropriate tool for this problem is the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). It states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface that encloses the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n**3. Calculating the Surface Integral (Flux)**\n\nWe will evaluate the right-hand side of the theorem, which is the flux through the spherical surface.\n\n*   **On the surface `S`**, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So the field is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n*   **The differential surface area vector `dS`** for a sphere points radially outward. Its magnitude is `R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. So, `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`.\n\nNow, we compute the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n`f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r̂ ] ⋅ [ (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂ ]`\n\nThe `R^2` terms cancel. The dot product of the radial unit vector with itself is `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`.\n`f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nNext, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The integration limits for the angle `θ` are from `0` to `π`, and for the angle `φ` are from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nThis integral evaluates to `4π`. The previous step confirmed this result using a Python script, which returned `4*pi`.\n\n*   **Inner integral:** `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -(-1) - (-1) = 2`\n*   **Outer integral:** `∫_0^{2π} 2 dφ = 2 * [φ]_0^{2π} = 2(2π) = 4π`\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nBy the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral of the flux.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere.\n\nComparing this result with the options provided:\nA) 4/3 π R\nB) 4 π\nC) 0\nD) 1\n\nThe most appropriate answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\nWe are given a vector field **f**(r) with the following properties:\n*   Its magnitude is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the origin: |**f**(r)| = f(r) = 1/r².\n*   Its direction is purely radial, pointing away from the origin.\n\nWe need to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of this field (∫∫∫ ∇·**f** dV) over a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\n### 2. Expressing the Vector Field\n\nIn spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ), a purely radial vector field can be written as:\n**f**(r) = f(r) * **r̂**\nwhere **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\nGiven that f(r) = 1/r², the vector field is:\n**f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**\n\nThis field is analogous to the electric field of a unit point charge at the origin or the gravitational field of a unit mass at the origin (ignoring constants and signs).\n\n### 3. Method 1: Direct Calculation of Divergence (with a caveat)\n\nThe formula for the divergence of a vector field **A** = Aᵣ **r̂** + A_θ **θ̂** + A_φ **φ̂** in spherical coordinates is:\n∇·**A** = (1/r²) ∂/∂r (r² Aᵣ) + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂/∂θ (sinθ A_θ) + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂/∂φ (A_φ)\n\nFor our field **f**(r), we have:\n*   Aᵣ = fᵣ = 1/r²\n*   A_θ = 0\n*   A_φ = 0\n\nSubstituting these into the divergence formula:\n∇·**f** = (1/r²) ∂/∂r (r² * (1/r²)) + 0 + 0\n∇·**f** = (1/r²) ∂/∂r (1)\n∇·**f** = (1/r²) * 0 = 0\n\nThis calculation seems to imply that the divergence is zero everywhere. If we integrate zero over the volume, the result would be 0.\n`∫∫∫ (0) dV = 0`\n\n**However, this is incorrect.** The vector field **f**(r) = 1/r² is singular (undefined) at the origin (r=0). Our calculation of the divergence is only valid for r ≠ 0. The point r=0, which is a point of infinite divergence (a \"source\"), is included in our integration volume. Therefore, we cannot simply conclude the integral is zero.\n\n### 4. Method 2: Using the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)\n\nA more robust way to solve this problem, especially with a singularity at the origin, is to use the Divergence Theorem. The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V is equal to the flux of that field through the closed surface S that bounds the volume:\n\n∫∫∫_V (∇·**f**) dV = ∮_S (**f** · d**S**)\n\n*   **V** is the volume of the sphere of radius R.\n*   **S** is the surface of the sphere of radius R.\n*   **f** is our vector field, **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**.\n*   d**S** is the differential surface area vector. For a sphere of radius r, its direction is radially outward, so d**S** = dS **r̂**. The magnitude dS in spherical coordinates is r² sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n\nNow, we evaluate the surface integral (flux) over the sphere of radius R:\n∮_S (**f** · d**S**)\n\nOn the surface of the sphere, the radius r is constant and equal to R. So, we evaluate **f** at r=R:\n**f**(r=R) = (1/R²) **r̂**\n\nThe differential surface element on this sphere is:\nd**S** = (R² sinθ dθ dφ) **r̂**\n\nNow we compute the dot product **f** · d**S**:\n**f** · d**S** = [(1/R²) **r̂**] · [(R² sinθ dθ dφ) **r̂**]\nSince **r̂** · **r̂** = 1, the dot product simplifies to:\n**f** · d**S** = (1/R²) * (R² sinθ dθ dφ) = sinθ dθ dφ\n\nNow, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for a full sphere are θ from 0 to π, and φ from 0 to 2π.\n\n∮_S (**f** · d**S**) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sinθ dθ dφ\n\nLet's evaluate the integral. We can separate the variables:\n= [∫(from φ=0 to 2π) dφ] * [∫(from θ=0 to π) sinθ dθ]\n\nEvaluating the first integral:\n∫(from φ=0 to 2π) dφ = [φ] from 0 to 2π = 2π - 0 = 2π\n\nEvaluating the second integral:\n∫(from θ=0 to π) sinθ dθ = [-cosθ] from 0 to π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nMultiplying the results:\n∮_S (**f** · d**S**) = (2π) * (2) = 4π\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, this surface integral is equal to the volume integral of the divergence:\n∫∫∫_V (∇·**f**) dV = 4π\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe divergence of the field is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it is a singularity. This singularity represents a source. The Divergence Theorem allows us to find the total \"strength\" of this source by measuring the total flux leaving the enclosing surface.

Integrating 4πδ³(**r**) over a volume that includes the origin gives 4π, confirming the result from the Divergence Theorem.*\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define the Vector Field**\n\nThe problem states that the vector field `f(r)` falls off radially as `1/r^2`. This means:\n*   The field has a component only in the radial direction (`r_hat`).\n*   The magnitude of the field is `|f(r)| = 1/r^2`.\n\nSo, we can write the vector field `f` in spherical coordinates as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n**2. Identify the Goal**\n\nWe need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field:\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV`\nwhere `V` is the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**3. Choose the Method: Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe vector field `f(r)` has a singularity at the origin (`r=0`), where the magnitude `1/r^2` goes to infinity. Directly calculating the divergence `∇ . f` can be tricky because of this singularity.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem is the ideal tool for this situation. It relates the volume integral of the divergence to a surface integral over the boundary of the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV = ∮_S (f . n_hat) dS`\n\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `n_hat` is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the surface `S`. For a sphere, this is simply the radial unit vector, `n_hat = r_hat`.\n*   `dS` is the differential surface area element.\n\nThe advantage of this theorem is that the surface integral is evaluated on the surface of the sphere (`r=R`), where the field is well-behaved and finite.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Surface Integral**\n\nLet's compute the components of the surface integral `∮_S (f . n_hat) dS`.\n\n*   **Calculate the dot product `(f . n_hat)`:**\n    `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n    `n_hat = r_hat`\n    `f . n_hat = ((1/r^2) * r_hat) . r_hat = 1/r^2` (since `r_hat . r_hat = 1`)\n\n*   **Evaluate the dot product on the surface `S`:**\n    The surface `S` is a sphere of radius `R`. On this entire surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n    So, on the surface, `f . n_hat = 1/R^2`.\n\n*   **Set up and solve the integral:**\n    `∮_S (f . n_hat) dS = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n    Since `1/R^2` is a constant with respect to the surface integration, we can pull it out of the integral:\n    `= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n\n*   **Interpret the remaining integral `∮_S dS`:**\n    This integral is simply the total surface area of the sphere `S`. The surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is given by the formula `4πR^2`.\n\n*   **Final Calculation:**\n    `= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n    `= 4π`\n\n**5.

(r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`, where `δ³(r)` is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function. The integral of the delta function over a volume containing the origin is 1. Therefore, `∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π`. This confirms the result from the Divergence Theorem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere's my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The request is to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f` over a specific volume `V`.\n    *   Integral: `I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`\n    *   Vector Field: `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`. This means the field has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and points radially outward from the origin.\n    *   Volume: `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n2.  **Initial Approach: Direct Calculation:**\n    My first thought might be to calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` and then integrate it over the volume.\n    The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is:\n    `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + (1/(r*sin(θ))) * ∂(sin(θ) * f_θ)/∂θ + (1/(r*sin(θ))) * ∂(f_φ)/∂φ`\n    In this problem, the field `f` is purely radial:\n    *   `f_r = 1/r^2` (radial component)\n    *   `f_θ = 0` (polar component)\n    *   `f_φ = 0` (azimuthal component)\n    Substituting these into the divergence formula:\n    `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r`\n    `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r`\n    `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`\n    This calculation shows that the divergence is zero *everywhere except at the origin (r=0)*. At `r=0`, the field `f` itself is infinite (`1/0^2`), so the divergence is undefined.\n\n3.  **Identify the Problem:** If we just integrate `∇ ⋅ f = 0` over the volume, we get `∫ 0 dV = 0`. This is suspicious because it ignores the fact that something special is happening at the origin. A single point has zero volume, so its contribution to a standard Riemann integral is zero. However, in physics and advanced calculus, such singularities (often representing sources like charges or masses) have a finite, non-zero effect. The field is singular, which suggests we need a more powerful tool.\n\n4.  **Second Approach: The Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem):**\n    This theorem is perfect for this situation. It relates a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the field itself.\n    The theorem states: `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    Where `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V`.\n    *   **Caveat:** The Divergence Theorem requires the vector field `f` to be continuously differentiable throughout the entire volume `V`. In our case, `f` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), which is inside our volume.\n    *   **Resolution:** This is a classic textbook case. The standard way to handle this is to proceed by applying the theorem, understanding that it correctly accounts for the \"source\" at the singularity. The integral of the divergence is interpreted as the net flux out of the volume, which is exactly what the surface integral calculates. In a more rigorous proof, one would exclude an infinitesimally small sphere around the origin from the volume of integration and show that the surface integral over this small inner sphere accounts for the singularity, leading to the same result.\n\n5.  **Applying the Divergence Theorem:**\n    Let's calculate the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n    *   **Surface S:** The surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   **Vector Field on the Surface:** On the surface `S`, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    *   **Differential Surface Element dS:** For a sphere, a small patch of area has a normal vector that points radially outward. So, `dS` is also in the `r_hat` direction. Its magnitude is the area of the patch, which in spherical coordinates is `dA = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n        Therefore, `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`.\n    *   **Dot Product:** Now we compute `f ⋅ dS`:\n        `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat ]`\n        `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2) * sin(θ) dθ dφ * (r_hat ⋅ r_hat)`\n        Since `r_hat` is a unit vector, `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`.\n        `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n6.  **Performing the Integration:**\n    Now we integrate this result over the entire surface of the sphere.

This means the vector field can be written as `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   The volume of integration is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n    *   The integral to evaluate is `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n2.  **Choose the Right Tool: The Divergence Theorem**\n    The Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) provides a powerful way to relate a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the vector field itself. The theorem states:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    Where:\n    *   `V` is the volume (the sphere of radius R).\n    *   `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V` (the surface of the sphere of radius R).\n    *   `dS` is the differential surface area vector, which points outward from the surface.\n\n    This theorem is particularly useful here because the vector field `f` has a singularity at the origin (`r=0`), where it is undefined. Calculating the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly would involve the Dirac delta function (`∇ ⋅ (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`), which can be tricky. Using the surface integral bypasses this complication.\n\n3.  **Set up the Surface Integral**\n    We need to evaluate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n    *   **The Surface `S`**: This is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`. On this surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n    *   **The Vector Field `f` on the Surface**: We substitute `r=R` into the expression for `f`. So, on the surface `S`, `f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    *   **The Differential Surface Area Vector `dS`**: For a sphere, the differential surface area element in spherical coordinates is `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. The direction of this area element is normal to the surface, which is the radial direction `r_hat`. So, `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`**\n    Now we take the dot product of the vector field `f` on the surface and the differential surface area vector `dS`:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat ]`\n    Since the dot product of a unit vector with itself is 1 (`r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`), the expression simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integral**\n    Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. In spherical coordinates, this means integrating with respect to `θ` from `0` to `π` and with respect to `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    First, we evaluate the inner integral with respect to `θ`:\n    `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    Now, we substitute this result into the outer integral with respect to `φ`:\n    `∫_{φ=0}^{2π} (2) dφ = [2φ]_0^{2π} = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of `f` is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\n    The result `4π` is a constant and is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere. This is because the `1/r^2` decrease in the field's magnitude is perfectly offset by the `r^2` increase in the surface area of the sphere.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 4/3 π R\nB) 0\nC) 4 π\nD) 1\n\nThe calculated answer is `4π`, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nThis problem requires us to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of a given vector field over a sphere of radius R.\n\n**1. Define the Vector Field**\nThe problem states that the vector field `f(r)` has a magnitude that falls off as `1/r^2` and is directed radially outwards from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n`f = (1/r^2) * r̂`\nwhere `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n**2. Identify the Goal**\nWe need to evaluate the volume integral:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`\nwhere `V` is the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**3. Choose the Method: The Divergence Theorem**\nThe Divergence Theorem provides a powerful way to solve this. It relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface enclosing the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dA)`\nwhere `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n**Why the Divergence Theorem is appropriate here:**\nA direct calculation of the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` runs into a problem. The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates for a field `f = f_r * r̂` is:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r`\nFor our field, `f_r = 1/r^2`. So,\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`\nThis calculation is valid for all `r > 0`. However, at the origin `(r = 0)`, the field `f` is infinite, creating a singularity. The divergence is undefined at this single point. The Divergence Theorem elegantly handles this by converting the volume integral (which contains the singularity) into a surface integral (which is on the boundary `r = R`, where the field is well-behaved). The contribution from the singularity at the origin is captured by the flux through the enclosing surface. This is the essence of Gauss's Law in electromagnetism.\n\n**4. Apply the Divergence Theorem**\n\n*   **The vector field on the surface:** On the surface of the sphere `S`, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So the field `f` on the surface is:\n    `f(r=R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n\n*   **The differential surface area vector:** For a sphere, the differential area element `dA` is a vector that points radially outward (in the direction of `r̂`) and has a magnitude of `R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n    `dA = r̂ * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n*   **Calculate the dot product `f ⋅ dA`:**\n    `f ⋅ dA = [ (1/R^2) * r̂ ] ⋅ [ r̂ * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ ]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dA = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n*   **Integrate over the surface `S`:** Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are `φ` from `0` to `2π` and `θ` from `0` to `π`.\n\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dA) = ∫(φ=0 to 2π) ∫(θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    `= [ ∫(φ=0 to 2π) dφ ] * [ ∫(θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ ]`\n\n    Evaluate each integral:\n    `∫(φ=0 to 2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π`\n    `∫(θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    Multiply the results:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dA) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n**5.

So, `n_hat = r_hat`.\n\n*   **f on the surface S:** We need to evaluate the vector field `f` on the surface of the sphere, where the radial distance `r` is equal to `R`.\n    `f(at r=R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n\n*   **The Dot Product (f ⋅ n_hat):** Now we compute the dot product of the field on the surface and the normal vector.\n    `f ⋅ n_hat = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [r_hat]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = |r_hat|^2 = 1`, the dot product is:\n    `f ⋅ n_hat = 1/R^2`\n    Notice that this value is a constant everywhere on the surface of the sphere.\n\n*   **The Surface Integral:** Now we can perform the integration.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ n_hat) dS = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n    Since `1/R^2` is a constant with respect to the surface integration, we can pull it out of the integral:\n    `= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n    The integral `∮_S dS` simply means \"sum up all the small surface elements `dS` over the entire surface `S`\", which gives the total surface area of the sphere.\n    The surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n    So, the integral becomes:\n    `= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n\n*   **Final Result:** The `R^2` terms cancel out.\n    `= 4π`\n\n**4.

Therefore, we can find the value of the volume integral by calculating the flux integral `∬_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Flux Integral `∬_S (f ⋅ dS)`:**\n    *   **Surface `S`:** The surface is a sphere of constant radius `r = R`.\n    *   **Field on the Surface `f(S)`:** On the surface of the sphere, the vector field is `f = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n    *   **Surface Element `dS`:** For a sphere, the differential area element `dS` points radially outward.

Understanding the Vector Field\n\nThe problem describes a vector field `f(r)` with the following properties:\n*   Its magnitude is `|f(r)| = 1/r^2`, where `r` is the distance from the origin.\n*   Its direction is purely radial, pointing away from the origin.\n\nIn spherical coordinates, we can write this vector field as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n### 2. The Problem Statement\n\nWe need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∇ ⋅ f`, over the volume `V` of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\nThe integral to be calculated is:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`\n\n### 3. Choosing the Method: The Divergence Theorem\n\nThis problem is a classic application of the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses that volume.\n\nMathematically:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`, and `S` is its surface.\n\n**Important Note:** The Divergence Theorem requires the vector field to be well-behaved (continuously differentiable) everywhere inside the volume `V`. Our field `f(r) = r_hat / r^2` has a singularity at the origin (`r = 0`), where it is undefined. However, the theorem can still be used to find the answer by considering the flux through the boundary surface, which cleverly avoids the point of singularity. This is a standard technique for dealing with such problems, especially in contexts like electrostatics (e.g., Gauss's Law for a point charge).\n\n### 4. Applying the Divergence Theorem\n\nWe will calculate the right-hand side of the theorem: the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   **Surface `S`**: This is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`. On this surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n*   **Vector Field `f` on the surface**: At any point on the surface `S`, `r = R`. So the field is `f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   **Surface Element `dS`**: For a sphere, the differential surface element vector `dS` always points radially outward. Therefore, `dS = dS * r_hat`, where `dS` is the magnitude of the surface element area.\n*   **The Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`**: We compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [dS * r_hat]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, this simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * dS`\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Integral\n\nNow we can substitute this back into the surface integral:\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n\nSince `R` is the constant radius of the sphere, `1/R^2` is a constant and can be taken out of the integral:\n`= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n\nThe integral `∮_S dS` simply means summing up all the differential surface areas over the entire surface of the sphere. This is, by definition, the total surface area of the sphere.\nThe surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n\nSo, we have:\n`= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n\nThe `R^2` terms cancel out:\n`= 4π`\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\nBy the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral (flux) we just calculated.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThe result is a constant value, `4π`, independent of the radius `R` of the sphere (as long as `R > 0`, so that the singularity at the origin is enclosed).\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 1\nD) 4 π\n\nThe calculated answer matches option D.\n\n(Self-reflection: An attempt to calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly would yield 0 for `r > 0`. This is misleading because it ignores the singularity at `r=0`. The divergence at the origin is actually a Dirac delta function, `∇ ⋅ (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ^3(r)`. Integrating `4πδ^3(r)` over a volume containing the origin gives `4π`, confirming the result obtained using the Divergence Theorem.)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Vector Field**\n\nThe problem describes a vector field `f(r)` that has the following properties:\n*   It is directed radially outward from the origin.\n*   Its magnitude depends only on the distance `r` from the origin and is given by `f(r) = 1/r^2`.\n\nIn spherical coordinates `(r, θ, φ)`, we can express this vector field as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\nwhere `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction. This means the field has a radial component `f_r = 1/r^2`, and its other components are zero (`f_θ = 0`, `f_φ = 0`).\n\n### **2. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe need to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∇ ⋅ f`, over the volume `V` of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\nThe integral to evaluate is: `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n### **3. Method 1: Using the Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem provides a powerful way to solve this problem. It relates a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the field itself:\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nwhere `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V`. In this case, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\nLet's evaluate the surface integral on the right-hand side:\n\n*   **The vector field `f` on the surface `S`:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the field `f` on the surface is `f = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n*   **The surface element vector `dS`:** For a sphere, the infinitesimal surface element vector `dS` points in the direction of the outward normal. The outward normal to a sphere is simply the radial unit vector `r̂`. So, `dS = dS * r̂`, where `dS` is the magnitude of the area element.\n*   **The dot product `f ⋅ dS`:**\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [dS * r̂]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * dS`\n*   **The surface integral:**\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∮_S (1/R^2) * dS`\n    Since `R` is a constant over the entire surface of integration, we can take `1/R^2` outside the integral:\n    `= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n*   **Final evaluation:** The integral `∮_S dS` is simply the total surface area of the sphere. The surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n    Therefore, the value of the integral is:\n    `= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2) = 4π`\n\nSo, by the Divergence Theorem, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`.\n\n### **4. Method 2: Direct Calculation of the Divergence (Conceptual Check)**\n\nLet's try to calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly. The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + (terms involving f_θ and f_φ)`\n\nSince `f_θ = f_φ = 0`, the formula simplifies to:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r`\n\nSubstitute `f_r = 1/r^2`:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`\n\nThis calculation shows that the divergence is zero *everywhere except at the origin (r=0)*. At `r=0`, the field `f` is undefined (it blows up), and so is its divergence. This type of field, which is analogous to the electric field of a point charge, has a \"source\" at the origin. The divergence at this point is not zero; it is a three-dimensional Dirac delta function:\n`∇ ⋅ (r̂/r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`\n\nNow, we can evaluate the volume integral:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV`\n\nBy the definition of the Dirac delta function, integrating it over a volume that contains the origin (`r=0`) yields 1. Since the sphere of radius `R` is centered at the origin, it contains the point `r=0`.\n`∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV = 4π * ∫_V δ³(r) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π`\n\nBoth methods give the same result.

In spherical coordinates, a purely radial vector field can be written as `f = f_r * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    Given the magnitude, the vector field is:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`, where `V` is the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n3.  **Choose the Method:**\n    We can attempt to calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly and then integrate it. However, the field `f(r) = 1/r^2 * r_hat` is singular at the origin (`r = 0`), which is inside our volume of integration. A naive calculation of the divergence might miss the contribution from this singularity.\n    A more robust method is to use the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of the field through the closed surface that bounds the volume:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    Here, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`. This method is particularly useful because the surface `S` is at `r = R`, where the field `f` is well-behaved (not singular).\n\n4.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:**\n    *   **Vector Field on the Surface (S):** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is:\n        `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n\n    *   **Differential Surface Area Vector (dS):** For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` points in the outward normal direction, which is the radial direction `r_hat`. Its magnitude is `R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`. Therefore:\n        `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat`\n\n    *   **Compute the Dot Product (f ⋅ dS):** Now we compute the dot product of the field and the surface area element on the surface of the sphere:\n        `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat]`\n        `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * (r_hat ⋅ r_hat)`\n        Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the dot product simplifies to:\n        `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n        Notice that the `R^2` terms cancel out.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Surface Integral:**\n    Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere in spherical coordinates are `φ` from `0` to `2π` and `θ` from `0` to `π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫[φ=0 to 2π] ∫[θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (∫[φ=0 to 2π] dφ) * (∫[θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ)`\n    Let's evaluate each integral:\n    *   `∫[φ=0 to 2π] dφ = [φ] from 0 to 2π = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n    *   `∫[θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)] from 0 to π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    Multiplying the results:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\n    *(Note: A direct calculation of the divergence gives `∇ ⋅ f = 0` for `r ≠ 0`. The result `4π` comes entirely from the contribution of the singularity at the origin, which is properly captured by the Divergence Theorem. The divergence is actually a Dirac delta function: `∇ ⋅ (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`.

We can solve it using two main methods: the Divergence Theorem or direct calculation. The Divergence Theorem is generally more straightforward, especially when dealing with singularities.\n\n### Method 1: Using the Divergence Theorem\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f` over a volume `V` is equal to the surface integral of the field over the closed surface `S` that bounds the volume:\n\n∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)\n\n1.  **Identify the vector field and the surface:**\n    *   The vector field is given as radial with magnitude `1/r^2`. In vector notation, `f = (1/r^2) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   The volume is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n    *   The bounding surface `S` is the surface of this sphere.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the surface integral ∮_S (f ⋅ dS):**\n    *   On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So the field on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n    *   The differential surface area element `dS` for a sphere also points in the radial direction (outward normal). In spherical coordinates, `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`.\n    *   Now, we compute the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n        `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [(R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂]`\n        Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies significantly:\n        `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n3.  **Perform the integration over the entire surface:**\n    The limits for a full sphere are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    ∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_φ=0^(2π) ∫_θ=0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\n    *   First, integrate with respect to `θ`:\n        ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2\n\n    *   Now, integrate the result with respect to `φ`:\n        ∫_0^(2π) 2 dφ = 2 * [φ]_0^(2π) = 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π\n\nTherefore, by the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is `4π`.\n\n### Method 2: Direct Calculation (and its pitfall)\n\n1.  **Calculate the divergence ∇ ⋅ f:**\n    In spherical coordinates, the divergence is `∇⋅f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * f_r)`.\n    Here, the radial component of the field is `f_r = 1/r^2`.\n    `∇⋅f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * (1/r^2)) = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (1) = 0`\n\n2.  **The Singularity at the Origin:**\n    This result `∇⋅f = 0` is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. At the origin (`r = 0`), the field `1/r^2` is infinite, so it's a singularity. A naive integration of `0` over the volume would incorrectly yield `0`. The divergence at the origin is not zero; it is a Dirac delta function. For this specific field, it can be shown that `∇⋅(r̂/r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`, where `δ³(r)` is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function which is non-zero only at the origin.\n\n3.  **Integrate the divergence including the delta function:**\n    ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV\n    By the definition of the delta function, this integral is `4π` if the origin is inside the volume of integration (which it is, as the sphere is centered at the origin) and `0` otherwise.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, `4π`.

This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\nWe are asked to compute the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\nThe vector field `f` is defined as:\n*   Its magnitude is `|f| = 1/r^2`, where `r` is the radial distance from the origin.\n*   It points purely in the radial direction.\n\nIn spherical coordinates `(r, θ, φ)`, the unit vector in the radial direction is `r̂`. So, the vector field can be written as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) r̂`\n\nThe volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n### 2. Method 1: Direct Calculation of Divergence (with a caveat)\n\nFirst, let's try to calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly. The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field `f = f_r r̂ + f_θ θ̂ + f_φ φ̂` is:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + (1/(r sinθ)) * ∂(f_θ sinθ)/∂θ + (1/(r sinθ)) * ∂(f_φ)/∂φ`\n\nIn our case, `f_r = 1/r^2`, and `f_θ = 0`, `f_φ = 0`. Plugging these in:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r + 0 + 0`\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r`\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`\n\nThis calculation suggests that the divergence is zero. If we integrate `0` over any volume, the result would be `0`.\n\nHowever, this result is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. At the origin `r = 0`, the field `f` is singular (1/0 is undefined). The standard formula for divergence cannot be applied at this point. The divergence is actually non-zero at the origin in a special way (it's a Dirac delta function), and this single point contributes to the entire value of the integral. To handle this singularity correctly, we should use the Divergence Theorem.\n\n### 3. Method 2: Using the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)\n\nThe Divergence Theorem provides a more robust way to solve this problem. It states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface that bounds the volume:\n\n`∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `S` is the surface of this sphere.\n*   `dS` is the outward-pointing differential surface area vector.\n\nLet's evaluate the surface integral (the right-hand side of the theorem).\n\n1.  **The vector field `f` on the surface `S`**: On the surface of the sphere, the radius is constant, `r = R`. So the field is:\n    `f = (1/R^2) r̂`\n\n2.  **The surface element `dS`**: For a sphere of radius `R`, the differential surface element in spherical coordinates is:\n    `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ r̂`\n    The direction `r̂` is radially outward, which is the correct orientation for the Divergence Theorem.\n\n3.  **The dot product `f ⋅ dS`**:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) r̂ ] ⋅ [ R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ r̂ ]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, this simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    Notice that the `R^2` terms have conveniently cancelled out.\n\n4.  **The surface integral `∮∮_S`**: Now we integrate `f ⋅ dS` over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are `φ` from `0` to `2π`, and `θ` from `0` to `π`.\n\n    `∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫[from φ=0 to 2π] ∫[from θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    Let's evaluate the integrals:\n    *   Inner integral (with respect to `θ`):\n        `∫[from 0 to π] sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)] [from 0 to π]`\n        `= -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    *   Outer integral (with respect to `φ`):\n        `∫[from 0 to 2π] 2 dφ = [2φ] [from 0 to 2π]`\n        `= 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\nSo, the surface integral is `4π`.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem:\n`∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = 4π`\n\nThis is a classic result in physics (related to Gauss's Law for a point charge), where the singularity at the origin acts as a \"source\" of divergence. The total divergence contained within any sphere enclosing the origin is `4π`, regardless of the sphere's radius `R`.\n\nComparing our result to the options:\nA) 4/3 π R\nB) 1\nC) 4 π\nD) 0\n\nThe correct answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`.\n*   **Vector Field `f`**: The field has a magnitude `|f(r)| = 1/r^2` and points radially outward from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this is expressed as:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\n    where `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r̂` is the radial unit vector.\n\n*   **Volume of Integration `V`**: The volume is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n*   **Integral to Evaluate**: We need to compute `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n### 2. Choosing the Method\n\nThis problem can be solved in two main ways:\n1.  By directly calculating the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` and then integrating it over the volume `V`.\n2.  By using the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) to convert the volume integral into a surface integral.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem is generally simpler for this type of problem.\n\n### 3. Applying the Divergence Theorem\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that for a vector field `f`, the integral of its divergence over a volume `V` is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that bounds the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\n**Important Consideration**: The Divergence Theorem requires the vector field `f` to be continuously differentiable everywhere inside the volume `V`. In our case, the field `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂` is singular (undefined) at the origin (`r = 0`). Since the sphere is centered at the origin, this singularity is inside our volume.\n\nHowever, the theorem can still be applied. The value of the volume integral is determined by the flux through the bounding surface. This method correctly accounts for the contribution of the singularity at the origin. This is a cornerstone of Gauss's Law in electromagnetism, which deals with an identical mathematical structure.\n\nLet's proceed with the surface integral:\n\n*   **Surface `S`**: The surface is the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   **Vector Field on the Surface**: At any point on the surface `S`, the radial distance is `r = R`. So the vector field is:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n*   **Differential Surface Element `dS`**: For a sphere, the differential surface element in spherical coordinates is a vector that points radially outward (in the direction of `r̂`). Its magnitude is `R^2 sinθ dθ dφ`. So,\n    `dS = (R^2 sinθ dθ dφ) * r̂`\n*   **The Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`**: Now we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [(R^2 sinθ dθ dφ) * r̂]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2) * sinθ dθ dφ`\n    `f ⋅ dS = sinθ dθ dφ`\n    Notice that the dependence on the radius `R` has canceled out.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Surface Integral**: We now integrate `f ⋅ dS` over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for spherical coordinates are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_0^(2π) ∫_0^π sinθ dθ dφ`\n\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    `= (∫_0^(2π) dφ) * (∫_0^π sinθ dθ)`\n\n    Evaluate each part:\n    `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n    `∫_0^π sinθ dθ = [-cosθ]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    Multiply the results:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n### 4. Alternative Method (Confirmation via Dirac Delta)\n\nFor completeness, let's consider the direct evaluation of the divergence. The divergence of the field `f(r) = r̂/r^2` is known to be zero everywhere except at the origin, where it is a singularity. This singularity can be expressed using the three-dimensional Dirac delta function `δ³(r)`:\n`∇ ⋅ f = ∇ ⋅ (r̂/r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`\n\nThe volume integral is then:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV`\n\nBy the definition of the Dirac delta function, integrating it over a volume that contains the origin (`r=0`) yields the value of the function multiplying it (in this case, the constant `4π`).\n`∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV = 4π`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe volume integral of the divergence of the given field is `4π`. This corresponds to option C.\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 4 π\nD) 0\n\nThe most appropriate answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### **1.

In vector notation using spherical coordinates, this is `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n*   **Volume of Integration (V):** The volume is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n*   **The Integral:** We need to evaluate `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n### **2. Choose the Method: The Divergence Theorem**\n\nDirectly calculating the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` and then integrating over the volume can be tricky because the field `f` is singular (goes to infinity) at the origin `r=0`.\n\nA much more elegant approach is to use the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). This theorem relates a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the field over the boundary of that volume.\n\nThe theorem states:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V`. In our case, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n### **3. Set up the Surface Integral**\n\nWe need to evaluate the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   **Field on the Surface (f):** On the surface of the sphere, the radial distance `r` is always equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n\n*   **Differential Surface Vector (dS):** For a sphere, the differential surface area element vector `dS` always points radially outwards. Its magnitude in spherical coordinates is `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. Therefore, the vector is `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Dot Product (f ⋅ dS)**\n\nNow, we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n`f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat]`\n\nSince `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the dot product simplifies beautifully:\n`f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ)`\n`f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nNotice that the dependence on the radius `R` has canceled out. This means the flux is the same for any sphere centered at the origin, regardless of its radius.\n\n### **5. Evaluate the Integral**\n\nNow we integrate `sin(θ) dθ dφ` over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are:\n*   `θ` (polar angle) from 0 to `π`\n*   `φ` (azimuthal angle) from 0 to `2π`\n\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) [∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ] dφ`\n\nLet's evaluate the inner integral first (with respect to `θ`):\n`∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nNow substitute this result into the outer integral (with respect to `φ`):\n`∫(from 0 to 2π) 2 dφ = 2 * [φ]_0^2π = 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π`\n\n### **6.

By converting it to a surface integral on the sphere of radius `R`, we avoid integrating over the singularity itself.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Surface Integral (Flux):**\n    *   The surface integral is `∬_S (f . dS)`.\n    *   On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n    *   The differential surface area element `dS` for a sphere in spherical coordinates points radially outward. Its vector form is `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r̂`.\n    *   Now, we compute the dot product `f . dS`:\n        `f . dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] . [(R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r̂]`\n    *   Since `r̂ . r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies:\n        `f . dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n    *   Now, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for spherical coordinates are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n        `∬_S (f . dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    *   We can separate the integrals:\n        `= [ ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) dφ ] * [ ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ ]`\n    *   Evaluate each integral:\n        *   `∫(from φ=0 to 2π) dφ = [φ]` from 0 to 2π `= 2π - 0 = 2π`\n        *   `∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]` from 0 to π `= -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    *   Multiply the results:\n        `∬_S (f . dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n    *   `∫∫∫_V (∇ . f) dV = 4π`\n\n6.  **Alternative Consideration (Why not zero?):**\n    *   If one were to calculate the divergence `∇ . f` directly for `r > 0`, the result would be zero:\n        `∇ . f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * f_r) = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * (1/r^2)) = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (1) = 0`\n    *   This suggests the integral should be zero. However, this calculation is not valid at `r=0` where the field is infinite. This singularity acts as a point source, and its divergence is not zero but is represented by a Dirac delta function, `∇ . f = 4π * δ³(r)`. The integral of this over a volume containing the origin is `4π`. The Divergence Theorem elegantly handles this singularity by shifting the calculation to the boundary surface.\n\nTherefore, the value of the integral is `4π`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Vector Field:**\n    The problem describes a vector field `f(r)` that points radially outward from the origin and has a magnitude that falls off as `1/r^2`. In spherical coordinates, this vector field can be written as:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n    where `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n2.  **State the Goal:**\n    We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∇ · f`, over the volume `V` of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n    The integral is: `I = ∫∫∫_V (∇ · f) dV`\n\n3.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem):**\n    The Divergence Theorem provides a powerful way to solve this problem.

In spherical coordinates, `∇ · f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r`. Since `f_r = 1/r^2`, we get `∇ · f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`. If we integrate 0 over the volume, we get 0. However, this calculation is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. The vector field `f(r)` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), and its divergence is also undefined there. The Divergence Theorem correctly handles this singularity at the origin.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Surface Integral:**\n    We will now calculate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, which is the flux of the field `f` through the surface of the sphere `S`.\n\n    *   **The field on the surface:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius is constant, `r = R`. So the vector field is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    *   **The differential surface area vector:** For a sphere, the outward-pointing normal vector is always in the radial direction, so `n_hat = r_hat`. The differential surface area vector `dS` is given by `dS = n_hat * dS`, where `dS` is the magnitude of the area element. In spherical coordinates, `dS = R^2 * sin(theta) d(theta) d(phi)`. Therefore, `dS = r_hat * (R^2 * sin(theta) d(theta) d(phi))`.\n    *   **The dot product:** We need to compute `f · dS`:\n        `f · dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] · [ r_hat * (R^2 * sin(theta) d(theta) d(phi)) ]`\n        Since `r_hat · r_hat = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n        `f · dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(theta) d(theta) d(phi)`\n        `f · dS = sin(theta) d(theta) d(phi)`\n        Notice that the `R^2` terms cancel out, meaning the result will be independent of the radius of the sphere.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Integral:**\n    Now we integrate `f · dS` over the entire surface of the sphere.

However, this is a classic scenario (analogous to Gauss's Law for a point charge in electromagnetism) where applying the theorem to the outer boundary gives the correct result for the source contained within. The value of the integral is determined entirely by the singularity at the origin.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Surface Integral (Flux):**\n    We will calculate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, `∮_S (f . dS)`.\n\n    *   **The Surface (S):** The surface is a sphere of radius `R`. On this surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n    *   **The Vector Field on the Surface (f):** On the surface of the sphere, the vector field is:\n        `f(r=R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n    *   **The Differential Surface Element (dS):** For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` points in the direction of the outward normal. The outward normal to a sphere is the radial direction `r̂`. So, the vector surface element is:\n        `dS = dS * r̂`\n        where `dS` is the magnitude of the differential area.\n    *   **The Dot Product (f . dS):** Now we compute the dot product inside the integral:\n        `f . dS = ((1/R^2) * r̂) . (dS * r̂)`\n        Since `r̂ . r̂ = 1`, this simplifies to:\n        `f . dS = (1/R^2) * dS`\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integral:**\n    Now substitute this back into the surface integral:\n    `∮_S (f . dS) = ∮_S (1/R^2) * dS`\n\n    Since `R` is the constant radius of the sphere, `1/R^2` is also a constant and can be taken out of the integral:\n    `= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n\n    The integral `∮_S dS` is simply the total surface area of the sphere `S`. The surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n\n    So, the value of the integral is:\n    `= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n    `= 4π`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this surface integral.\n    `∫_V (∇.f) dV = 4π`\n\n    Therefore, the most appropriate answer is `4π`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 4 π\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 0\n\nThe calculated answer matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\n*   **Vector Field (f):** The problem describes a vector field `f(r)`.\n    *   Its magnitude is `1/r^2`, where `r` is the radial distance from the origin.\n    *   Its direction is purely radial.\n    *   In spherical coordinates, this can be written as the vector `f = (1/r^2) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n*   **Objective:** We need to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of this field. This is written as `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n*   **Volume of Integration (V):** The integration is performed over the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n### 2. Choosing the Method\n\nThere are two primary ways to solve this:\n1.  Directly calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` and then integrate it over the volume. This method can be tricky because the field is singular at the origin `r=0`.\n2.  Use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem), which relates a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the field itself. This method is often much simpler for this type of problem.\n\nWe will use the Divergence Theorem as it is the most efficient method.\n\n### 3. Applying the Divergence Theorem\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ n̂) dS`\n\nWhere:\n*   `V` is the volume (the sphere of radius R).\n*   `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V` (the surface of the sphere of radius R).\n*   `n̂` is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the surface `S`.\n*   `dS` is the differential surface area element.\n\nThe theorem essentially says that the integral of all the \"sources\" (divergence) inside a volume is equal to the total \"flux\" (flow) of the field out of the surface enclosing that volume.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Surface Integral\n\nLet's evaluate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, `∮_S (f ⋅ n̂) dS`.\n\n*   **Vector Field on the Surface (f):** On the surface of the sphere, the radial distance `r` is always equal to the radius `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is `f = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n\n*   **Outward Normal Vector (n̂):** For a sphere centered at the origin, the outward-pointing normal vector at any point on the surface is simply the radial unit vector `r̂`. So, `n̂ = r̂`.\n\n*   **The Dot Product (f ⋅ n̂):** Now we compute the dot product of the field and the normal vector on the surface.\n    `f ⋅ n̂ = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [r̂]`\n    Since `r̂` is a unit vector, `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`.\n    `f ⋅ n̂ = 1/R^2`\n\n*   **The Surface Integral:** Now we substitute this constant value back into the surface integral:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ n̂) dS = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n\n    Since `R` is the constant radius of the sphere, the term `1/R^2` is constant over the entire surface of integration. We can pull it out of the integral:\n    `= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n\n    The integral `∮_S dS` simply means \"sum up all the tiny area elements over the entire surface,\" which is just the total surface area of the sphere. The formula for the surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n\n    So, `∮_S dS = 4πR^2`.\n\n*   **Final Calculation:** Putting it all together:\n    `= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2) = 4π`\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral we wanted to find is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ n̂) dS = 4π`\n\n**Note on the singularity:** The vector field `f = r̂/r^2` is undefined at the origin `r=0`. While this technically violates a condition of the Divergence Theorem, the theorem is routinely and correctly used for such cases in physics (e.g., Gauss's Law for an electric point charge). The physical interpretation is that the singularity at the origin acts as a point source, and the integral of the divergence correctly calculates the total strength of this source, which is `4π`. A more rigorous mathematical proof involves excluding an infinitesimal sphere around the origin and taking a limit, which yields the same result.\n\nThe calculated value is `4π`.

Understanding the Problem\n\n*   **Vector Field (f):** The problem describes a vector field `f`.\n    *   **Magnitude:** `|f| = 1/r^2`, where `r` is the distance from the origin.\n    *   **Direction:** The field points radially outwards from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this direction is represented by the unit vector `r̂`.\n    *   So, we can write the vector field as `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`.\n\n*   **The Integral:** We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field. The expression is `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n*   **The Volume (V):** The integration is performed over the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n### 2. Method 1: Using the Divergence Theorem\n\nThe Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) provides a powerful way to solve this. It states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume `V`.\n\n**Theorem:** `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\n*   **Surface (S):** In this case, the surface `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   **Surface Element (dS):** `dS` is the vector element of surface area. For a sphere, its magnitude is the differential area element `dS`, and its direction is the outward-pointing normal `n`. So, `dS = n dS`.\n\nLet's evaluate the surface integral (the right side of the theorem): `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n1.  **Field on the Surface:** At any point on the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is equal to `R`. So, the vector field `f` on the surface is `f = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n2.  **Surface Normal:** For a sphere centered at the origin, the outward-pointing normal vector `n` at any point on the surface is simply the radial unit vector `r̂`.\n3.  **Vector Surface Element (dS):** `dS = n dS = r̂ dS`.\n4.  **The Dot Product (f ⋅ dS):**\n    `f ⋅ dS = f ⋅ (n dS) = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [r̂ dS]`\n    Since `r̂` is a unit vector, `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`.\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) dS`.\n5.  **The Surface Integral:**\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n    Since `R` is a constant radius for the entire surface, `1/R^2` is a constant and can be taken out of the integral:\n    `= (1/R^2) ∮_S dS`\n    The integral `∮_S dS` is simply the total surface area of the sphere. The formula for the surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n    `= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n    `= 4π`.\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`.\n\n**A Note on the Singularity:** The Divergence Theorem technically requires the vector field to be well-defined and differentiable everywhere inside the volume. The field `f = (1/r^2) * r̂` is singular (undefined) at the origin (`r = 0`), which is inside our sphere. However, the theorem still holds. The singularity at the origin acts as a \"source,\" and the divergence integral precisely calculates the strength of this source. The surface integral correctly measures the total flux flowing out from this source.\n\n### 3. Method 2: Direct Calculation of the Divergence\n\nWe can also try to calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly.\n\n1.  **Divergence Formula in Spherical Coordinates:**\n    `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + ...` (other terms are zero since `f_θ = f_φ = 0`)\n    Our field has `f_r = 1/r^2`.\n2.  **Calculation:**\n    `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r`\n    `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r`\n    `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`\n\nThis calculation shows that the divergence is zero *everywhere except at the origin* (`r > 0`). This seems to imply the integral would be zero. However, this misses the effect of the singularity at `r = 0`. In the theory of distributions, the divergence of this specific field is not zero; it is a Dirac delta function centered at the origin:\n`∇ ⋅ (r̂ / r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`\nwhere `δ³(r)` is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function.\n\n3.  **Integrating the Delta Function:**\n    The volume integral becomes:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV`\n    By the definition of the delta function, integrating it over a volume that contains the origin gives the value of the function multiplying it (in this case, the constant `4π`):\n    `= 4π`.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the result is `4π`.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe volume integral of the divergence of the given field within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin evaluates to `4π`. This value is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere, as long as `R > 0` and the origin is enclosed.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 4π\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe most appropriate answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nThis problem asks for the evaluation of the volume integral of the divergence of a given vector field, `∇.f`, within a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\nThe vector field `f` is given by:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\nwhere `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nThe integral to be evaluated is:\n`I = ∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`\nwhere `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\nThis problem can be elegantly solved using the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem), which states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the outward flux of the vector field through the closed surface `S` that bounds the volume `V`.\n\n`∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, the volume `V` is the sphere of radius `R`, and its bounding surface `S` is the surface of this sphere.\n\nLet's evaluate the surface integral on the right-hand side.\n1.  **Vector Field on the Surface:** On the surface of the sphere, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to the radius `R`. So the vector field on the surface is:\n    `f(r=R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n\n2.  **Differential Surface Area Element:** For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` points radially outward. In spherical coordinates, it is given by:\n    `dS = r̂ * dS = r̂ * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    where `θ` is the polar angle (from 0 to π) and `φ` is the azimuthal angle (from 0 to 2π).\n\n3.  **Dot Product:** Now we compute the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [r̂ * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ]`\n    Since `r̂` is a unit vector, `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`. The `R^2` terms cancel out.\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n4.  **Surface Integral:** Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere by integrating over the full range of `θ` and `φ`.\n    `∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_(φ=0)^(2π) ∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nLet's evaluate the integral. We can separate the variables:\n`∫_(φ=0)^(2π) dφ * ∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ`\n\nThe integral with respect to `θ` is:\n`∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nThe integral with respect to `φ` is:\n`∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n\nMultiplying the results:\n`∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\nTherefore, by the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of the field is `4π`.\n\n`I = ∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\n**Alternative Method (Direct Calculation):**\nThe divergence of the field `f(r) = r̂/r^2` in spherical coordinates is `∇ ⋅ (r̂/r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`, where `δ³(r)` is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function. This signifies that the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, where there is a point source.\nThe integral becomes:\n`I = ∫∫∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV`\nSince the volume of integration (a sphere of radius `R`) includes the origin (where the delta function is non-zero), the integral evaluates to the value of the function multiplying the delta function, which is `4π`.\n`I = 4π`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4 π\nC) 1\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe calculated answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1.

Choose the Right Tool: The Divergence Theorem**\n\nDirectly calculating the divergence of `f` and then integrating over the volume can be tricky because the field `f` is singular at the origin `r=0` (the function `1/r^2` goes to infinity).\n\nA more elegant and powerful method is to use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that bounds the volume.\n\nMathematically:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `dS` is the outward-pointing differential surface area vector.\n\nThe key advantage here is that the surface `S` is at `r=R`, where the field `f` is perfectly well-behaved (it's not singular).\n\n**3. Set up the Surface Integral**\n\nWe need to evaluate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   **Vector field on the surface S:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n*   **Differential surface area vector dS:** For a sphere in spherical coordinates, the differential area element is `dA = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. Since `dS` must be a vector pointing outward from the surface, its direction is the radial direction `r̂`. Therefore, `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Dot Product**\n\nNow we find the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n`f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [(R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂]`\n\nSince `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the expression simplifies significantly:\n`f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2) * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nNotice that the `R^2` terms cancel out. This is a characteristic feature of `1/r^2` fields and indicates that the flux will be independent of the radius `R` of the sphere.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Integral**\n\nNow we integrate `sin(θ) dθ dφ` over the entire surface of the sphere. In spherical coordinates, this means integrating `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) [ ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ ] dφ`\n\nFirst, evaluate the inner integral (with respect to `θ`):\n`∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]` (from `0` to `π`)\n`= -cos(π) - (-cos(0))`\n`= -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nNow, substitute this result into the outer integral (with respect to `φ`):\n`∫(from φ=0 to 2π) 2 dφ = [2φ]` (from `0` to `2π`)\n`= 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral we wanted to find is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = 4π`\n\nThis result has a physical analogy in electrostatics (Gauss's Law).

In vector form, using spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r` is the radial distance and `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nThe volume of integration `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\nThis problem is ideally suited for the application of the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume.\n\nThe theorem is expressed as:\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`\n\nLet's evaluate the right-hand side, which is the surface integral of `f` over the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n1.  **The vector field on the surface:** The surface `S` is the sphere of radius `R`. On this surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n\n2.  **The differential surface element:** For a sphere, the differential surface area element vector `dS` points radially outward, which is the same direction as `r_hat`. So, `dS = dS * r_hat`, where `dS` is the magnitude of the area element.\n\n3.  **The dot product `f . dS`:** Now we compute the dot product to be integrated:\n    `f . dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] . [dS * r_hat]`\n    Since the dot product of a unit vector with itself is 1 (`r_hat . r_hat = 1`), the expression simplifies to:\n    `f . dS = (1/R^2) * dS`\n\n4.  **The surface integral:** Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface `S` of the sphere:\n    `∮_S (f . dS) = ∮_S (1/R^2) * dS`\n    Since `R` is the constant radius of the sphere, `1/R^2` is a constant and can be taken out of the integral:\n    `∮_S (f . dS) = (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n    The integral `∮_S dS` represents the total surface area of the sphere.

In spherical coordinates, `∇ . f` for `r > 0` is `0`. However, the field `f(r) = 1/r^2 * r_hat` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), which is inside our volume of integration. The divergence at the origin is technically a Dirac delta function.

Its magnitude is `|f(r)| = 1/r^2`, and its direction is radial. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n    where `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n    The volume of integration, `V`, is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n2.  **State the problem:**\n    We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field `f(r)`:\n    `∫_V (∇ · f) dV`\n\n3.  **Analyze the divergence of the field:**\n    We can calculate the divergence of `f` using the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates:\n    `∇ · A = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * Ar)/∂r + ...` (other terms involve derivatives with respect to θ and φ)\n    For our field `f`, the only non-zero component is the radial one, `f_r = 1/r^2`.\n    So, `∇ · f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`.\n\n    This calculation is valid for all `r ≠ 0`. However, at the origin (`r = 0`), the field `f(r)` itself is undefined (it has a singularity). The divergence `∇ · f` is not zero at the origin; it is a Dirac delta function. A direct integration of `∇ · f` is non-trivial because of this singularity.\n\n4.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem):**\n    A more powerful way to solve this is to use the Divergence Theorem, which relates a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the vector field's flux. The theorem states:\n    `∫_V (∇ · f) dV = ∮_S (f · dS)`\n    where `S` is the closed surface enclosing the volume `V`. In this case, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n    This theorem is applicable even with a point singularity inside the volume, as it allows us to perform the calculation on the boundary surface where the field is well-behaved.\n\n5.  **Calculate the surface integral (flux):**\n    We need to compute the flux of `f` through the surface `S` of the sphere of radius `R`.\n    -   On the surface `S`, the radial distance is constant: `r = R`. So the field is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    -   The differential surface area element `dS` on a sphere, with the normal pointing outwards, is given by `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ * r_hat`.\n    -   Now, we take the dot product `f · dS`:\n        `f · dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] · [R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ * r_hat]`\n        Since `r_hat · r_hat = 1`, the dot product simplifies to:\n        `f · dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n\n6.  **Evaluate the integral:**\n    Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for spherical coordinates are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n    `∮_S (f · dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    `= (∫_0^{2π} dφ) * (∫_0^{π} sin(θ) dθ)`\n\n    -   The first integral is: `∫_0^{2π} dφ = [φ]_0^{2π} = 2π`.\n    -   The second integral is: `∫_0^{π} sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^{π} = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n    Multiplying the results:\n    `∮_S (f · dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this surface integral.\n    `∫_V (∇ · f) dV = 4π`.\n\n    This result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere, as long as it encloses the origin.

Calculate the Surface Integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`:**\nFirst, we find the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n`f ⋅ dS = ( (1/R^2) * r̂ ) ⋅ ( r̂ * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ )`\nSince `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n`f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * (r̂ ⋅ r̂) * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n`f ⋅ dS = 1 * 1 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n`f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nNow, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for spherical coordinates are:\n*   `θ` (polar angle) from `0` to `π`.\n*   `φ` (azimuthal angle) from `0` to `2π`.\n\nThe integral is:\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫[φ=0 to 2π] ∫[θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nLet's evaluate the integral in parts:\n1.  The integral with respect to `θ`:\n    `∫[from 0 to π] sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_[from 0 to π]`\n    `= (-cos(π)) - (-cos(0))`\n    `= (-(-1)) - (-(1))`\n    `= 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n2.  The integral with respect to `φ`:\n    `∫[from 0 to 2π] dφ = [φ]_[from 0 to 2π]`\n    `= 2π - 0 = 2π`\n\nNow, we multiply the results of the two parts:\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2) * (2π) = 4π`\n\n**5.

In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\n    where `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`, over the volume `V` of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:**\n    The Divergence Theorem provides a powerful tool to solve this kind of problem. It relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the surface integral of the flux of the field through the closed surface that bounds the volume. The theorem states:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    where `S` is the closed surface enclosing the volume `V`. In our case, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n4.  **Set up the Surface Integral:**\n    We need to evaluate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n    *   **Vector Field on the Surface (f):** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is:\n        `f(r=R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n\n    *   **Differential Surface Area Vector (dS):** For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` always points outward in the radial direction. Its magnitude is `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. So, the vector `dS` is:\n        `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Dot Product (f ⋅ dS):**\n    Now we take the dot product of `f` and `dS` on the surface of the sphere:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r̂ ] ⋅ [ (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂ ]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2) * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Integral:**\n    Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere.

However, the field is singular at the origin (`r=0`), and the divergence at this point is a Dirac delta function, `∇ ⋅ (r̂/r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`. Integrating `4πδ³(r)` over a volume containing the origin also yields `4π`. The Divergence Theorem conveniently handles this singularity by shifting the calculation to the boundary surface where the field is well-defined.\n\nThe calculated value is `4π`, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nThis problem asks us to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a radially symmetric vector field. The vector field is given by `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, and the volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\nThe integral to be evaluated is `I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\nWe can solve this problem using the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem), which states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the outward flux of the vector field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume. Mathematically:\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, the volume `V` is the sphere of radius `R`, and its enclosing surface `S` is the surface of this sphere.\n\n**Step 1: Define the vector field `f` on the surface `S`**\nOn the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. The vector field `f` on this surface is:\n`f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction, which is also the direction of the outward normal to the sphere.\n\n**Step 2: Define the differential surface area vector `dS`**\nFor a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` is a vector that points in the direction of the outward normal. The outward normal direction is the radial direction, `r_hat`. The magnitude of the area element in spherical coordinates is `R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`.\nTherefore, the vector surface element is:\n`dS = r_hat * (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ)`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the dot product `f ⋅ dS`**\nNow, we compute the dot product of the vector field `f` and the surface element `dS`:\n`f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ r_hat * (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) ]`\nSince `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n`f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n`f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\nNotice that the `R^2` terms have cancelled, indicating that the result will be independent of the radius `R` of the sphere.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the surface integral**\nWe now integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for a full sphere in spherical coordinates are `θ` from 0 to `π` and `φ` from 0 to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nFirst, we integrate with respect to `θ`:\n`∫_{0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_{0}^{π} = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nNext, we integrate the result with respect to `φ`:\n`∫_{0}^{2π} 2 dφ = [2φ]_{0}^{2π} = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, this is the value of the original volume integral.\n\n**Important Note:** One might be tempted to calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly. In spherical coordinates, for a field `f = f_r * r_hat`, the divergence is `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * d/dr(r^2 * f_r)`. For `f_r = 1/r^2`, this gives `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * d/dr(r^2 * 1/r^2) = (1/r^2) * d/dr(1) = 0`. This result is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. At the origin (`r = 0`), the field is singular, and this formula does not apply. The divergence at the origin is a Dirac delta function (`∇ ⋅ (r_hat/r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`). Integrating this over the volume containing the origin gives `4π`. The Divergence Theorem provides a more straightforward way to arrive at this result by avoiding the singularity.\n\nThe final answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** We are asked to compute the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`. The integral is `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n    *   The vector field `f` has a magnitude `|f| = 1/r^2` and points radially outward from the origin. In vector form, this is `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n2.  **Choose the Right Tool:** This problem is a classic application of the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface enclosing the volume. The theorem is stated as:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    where `S` is the closed surface bounding the volume `V`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Surface S and the Field on the Surface:**\n    *   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   The bounding surface `S` is the surface of this sphere.\n    *   The vector field on the surface `S` is found by setting `r = R` in the expression for `f`. So, on the surface, `f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n\n4.  **Define the Differential Surface Element dS:**\n    *   For a sphere, the outward-pointing normal vector is in the radial direction, i.e., `n = r_hat`.\n    *   The differential area element in spherical coordinates is `dA = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n    *   The vector differential surface element `dS` is `dS = n * dA = r_hat * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Dot Product (f ⋅ dS):**\n    *   `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ r_hat * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ ]`\n    *   Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the dot product simplifies to:\n    *   `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Surface Integral:**\n    *   Now we integrate `f ⋅ dS` over the entire surface of the sphere.

In spherical coordinates, for `f = f_r(r) * r_hat`, the divergence is `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r`.\nFor `f_r = 1/r^2`, `r^2 * f_r = 1`. The derivative `∂(1)/∂r = 0`. So, `∇ ⋅ f = 0` for any `r ≠ 0`.\nIf we naively integrate `0` over the volume, we get `0`. This is incorrect because it ignores the fact that the field `f` and its divergence are undefined (singular) at the origin `r=0`.\nThe divergence is actually `∇ ⋅ (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ^3(r)`, where `δ^3(r)` is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function. The integral of this over any volume containing the origin is `4π`.\nThe Divergence Theorem elegantly handles this singularity by shifting the calculation to the boundary surface, where the field is well-defined.\n\nComparing our result `4π` with the given options:\nA) 4/3 π R\nB) 0\nC) 4 π\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to compute the volume integral of the divergence of a given vector field `f` over a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin. The integral is `I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n2.  **Define the Vector Field:**\n    *   The problem states the vector field `f` has a magnitude `|f| = 1/r^2`.\n    *   It also states the field has a non-zero component only along the radial direction.\n    *   Therefore, in spherical coordinates, the vector field can be expressed as `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Divergence (`∇ ⋅ f`):**\n    *   We can compute the divergence of `f` using the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates:\n        `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r`\n        where `f_r` is the radial component of `f`.\n    *   Here, `f_r = 1/r^2`.\n    *   Substituting this in, we get:\n        `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`.\n    *   **Crucial Point:** This calculation is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. At the origin (`r = 0`), the field `f` is infinite (1/0), which means it has a singularity. The divergence is undefined at this point using this formula.\n\n4.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:**\n    *   The Divergence Theorem states that `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`, where `S` is the closed surface bounding the volume `V`.\n    *   The theorem has a condition that the vector field `f` must be continuously differentiable throughout the volume `V`. Due to the singularity at `r = 0`, this condition is not met for our volume `V` (the sphere of radius `R`).\n\n5.  **Handle the Singularity:**\n    *   To correctly apply the Divergence Theorem, we can exclude the singularity. We consider the volume `V'` to be the region between our original sphere `S_R` of radius `R` and a very small sphere `S_ε` of radius `ε` around the origin.\n    *   In this new volume `V'`, the field `f` is well-behaved, and we know that `∇ ⋅ f = 0`.\n    *   Therefore, `∫_V' (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∫_V' 0 dV = 0`.\n    *   Applying the Divergence Theorem to `V'`, the total flux out of its boundary must be zero. The boundary of `V'` consists of the outer surface `S_R` and the inner surface `S_ε`.\n        `∮_(S_R ∪ S_ε) (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_S_R (f ⋅ dS) + ∫_S_ε (f ⋅ dS_in) = 0`\n        where `dS_in` is the surface element for `S_ε` pointing into `V'` (i.e., towards the origin). This is `dS_in = -dS`, where `dS` points radially outward.\n    *   So, `∫_S_R (f ⋅ dS) - ∫_S_ε (f ⋅ dS_out) = 0`, which means `∫_S_R (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_S_ε (f ⋅ dS_out)`.\n    *   This shows that the flux through any sphere centered at the origin is the same.\n    *   The original integral `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV` can be understood as the total source/sink strength within the volume. Since the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, the entire contribution must come from the singularity at `r=0`. By the argument above, this is equal to the flux through the bounding surface `S_R`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Surface Integral (Flux):**\n    *   We now calculate the flux through the surface `S` of the sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   The vector field on this surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n    *   The differential surface element in spherical coordinates is `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`.

The integral to evaluate is:\n`∫_V (∇.f) dV`\n\n**2. Analyze the Divergence**\n\nWe could try to calculate the divergence `∇.f` directly using the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates:\n`∇.f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * f_r)`\nwhere `f_r` is the radial component of the field.

However, at the origin (`r = 0`), the field `f(r) = 1/r^2` is undefined (it goes to infinity). This is a singularity. The direct calculation of the divergence misses the contribution from this single point. Integrating `∇.f = 0` over the volume would incorrectly give an answer of 0.\n\n**3. Apply the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)**\n\nA more powerful method that correctly handles singularities inside the volume is the Divergence Theorem.

Evaluate the Surface Integral**\n\nLet's evaluate the surface integral `∮_S (f . dS)`:\n\n*   The surface `S` is a sphere of radius `R`.\n*   On this surface, the distance from the origin is constant: `r = R`.\n*   The vector field `f` on the surface is: `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   The outward-pointing unit normal vector `n_hat` to the sphere is the same as the radial unit vector `r_hat`. So, `n_hat = r_hat`.\n*   The differential surface vector is `dS = n_hat dS = r_hat dS`.\n\nNow, we can compute the dot product `f . dS`:\n`f . dS = ((1/R^2) * r_hat) .

Define the Vector Field and the Volume**\n\n*   **Vector Field (f):** The problem states that the field `f(r)` has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and points radially outwards from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this is written as:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n    where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n*   **Volume (V):** The volume is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**2. Apply the Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) provides a way to relate a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the flux. The theorem states:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V`. In our case, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\nThis approach is generally simpler than calculating the divergence directly, especially when dealing with singularities, as is the case here (the field is undefined at `r = 0`).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Surface Integral (Flux)**\n\nWe need to calculate the flux `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   **Field on the Surface (f(R)):** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n\n*   **Differential Surface Element (dS):** For a sphere of radius `R`, the differential area element `dS` in spherical coordinates, pointing in the outward radial direction, is:\n    `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat`\n    where `θ` is the polar angle and `φ` is the azimuthal angle.\n\n*   **Dot Product (f ⋅ dS):** Now, we take the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the dot product simplifies significantly. The `R^2` terms cancel out:\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n\n*   **Integration:** To find the total flux, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for `θ` are from `0` to `π`, and for `φ` are from `0` to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_(φ=0)^(2π) ∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    Let's evaluate the integral in steps:\n    1.  Integrate with respect to `θ`:\n        `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    2.  Integrate the result with respect to `φ`:\n        `∫_0^(2π) 2 dφ = [2φ]_0^(2π) = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe value of the surface integral is `4π`. According to the Divergence Theorem, this is also the value of the original volume integral.\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis result is a fundamental concept in physics (related to Gauss's Law for electric fields), representing the strength of the source at the origin.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4 π\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to compute the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n*   The vector field is given as `f(r)`. It has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and points radially outward from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n*   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**2. Method 1: Direct Calculation of the Divergence**\n\nFirst, let's try to calculate the divergence of `f`, denoted as `∇ ⋅ f`.\nIn spherical coordinates, the formula for the divergence of a vector field `f = f_r * r_hat + f_θ * θ_hat + f_φ * φ_hat` is:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + (1/(r*sinθ)) * ∂(f_θ * sinθ)/∂θ + (1/(r*sinθ)) * ∂f_φ/∂φ`\n\nFor our given field, `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, we have:\n*   `f_r = 1/r^2`\n*   `f_θ = 0`\n*   `f_φ = 0`\n\nSubstituting these into the divergence formula:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r + 0 + 0`\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r`\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`\n\nThis calculation shows that the divergence is zero. If we naively integrate this over the volume, we would get `∫_V (0) dV = 0`.\n\n**3. The Singularity at the Origin**\n\nHowever, there is a critical issue. The vector field `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat` is undefined (singular) at the origin (`r = 0`). Our calculation `∇ ⋅ f = 0` is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. Since the volume of integration (a sphere centered at the origin) includes this singularity, we cannot simply conclude the integral is zero.\n\nThis situation (a `1/r^2` radial field) is classic in physics, for example, the electric field of a point charge or the gravitational field of a point mass. The divergence at the origin is not zero; it is a source point represented by a Dirac delta function.\n\nTo properly handle this singularity, we should use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem).\n\n**4. Method 2: Using the Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that bounds the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere:\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `dS` is the differential surface area vector, which points outward from the surface.\n\nLet's evaluate the surface integral (the right-hand side of the theorem).\n\n*   **The vector field `f` on the surface `S`:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, `f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   **The surface element `dS`:** For a spherical surface, the differential area element is `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`. The direction is radially outward, so the vector is `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`.\n*   **The dot product `f ⋅ dS`:**\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat]`\n    The `R^2` terms cancel out. Since `r_hat` is a unit vector, `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`.\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nNow we integrate this over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for spherical coordinates are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_0^(2π) ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nWe can separate the integrals:\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (∫_0^(2π) dφ) * (∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ)`\n\nLet's evaluate each integral:\n*   `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n*   `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nMultiplying the results:\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this surface integral.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis result shows that although the divergence is zero everywhere except the origin, the contribution from the singularity at the origin is `4π`.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 1\nD) 4 π\n\nThe calculated value `4π` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`.\n*   **Vector Field (f):** The field has a magnitude `f(r) = 1/r^2` and points radially outwards from the origin. In vector notation, using spherical coordinates, this is `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n*   **Volume (V):** The integration is over the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n*   **Integral:** We need to calculate `I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n**2. Choose the Method: The Divergence Theorem**\n\nDirectly calculating the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` and then integrating over the volume can be problematic. Let's see why:\nThe formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r` (since `f_θ` and `f_φ` are zero).\nHere, `f_r = 1/r^2`.\nSo, `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`.\nIf we naively integrate this, we get `∫_V 0 dV = 0`. However, this is incorrect because the vector field `f` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), and the formula for divergence is not valid there. The divergence is actually a Dirac delta function at the origin.\n\nA more robust method is to use the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a field to the flux of the field through the closed surface that bounds the volume:\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere:\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `dS` is the differential surface area vector, which points outward from the surface.\n\nThis method works because the surface `S` is at `r=R`, where the field is well-behaved (not singular). The surface integral correctly accounts for the effect of the singularity inside the volume.\n\n**3. Apply the Divergence Theorem**\n\nWe need to calculate the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   **Field on the surface (f):** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is `f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n\n*   **Surface element (dS):** For a sphere of radius `R`, the differential surface area element in spherical coordinates is `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`. The direction of this area element is normal to the surface, which is the radial direction. So, the vector `dS` is `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat`.\n\n*   **Dot Product (f ⋅ dS):** Now we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element.\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat ]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n\n*   **Integrate over the surface:** We integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the spherical angles are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n**4. Evaluate the Integral**\n\nWe evaluate the integral in two steps:\n1.  **Inner integral (with respect to θ):**\n    `∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_{0}^{π}`\n    `= -cos(π) - (-cos(0))`\n    `= -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n2.  **Outer integral (with respect to φ):**\n    `∫_{φ=0}^{2π} 2 dφ = 2 * [φ]_{0}^{2π}`\n    `= 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nBy the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere (as long as `R > 0`).

Define the Vector Field**\nThe problem states that the vector field `f(r)` has a magnitude `|f(r)| = 1/r^2` and is directed radially. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n**2. The Integral to Evaluate**\nWe need to compute the volume integral of the divergence of `f` over a sphere `V` of radius `R` centered at the origin:\n`Integral = ∫_V (∇ . f) dV`\n\n**3. Applying the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)**\nThe Divergence Theorem provides a powerful way to solve this problem. It relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the surface integral of the flux of the field through the boundary surface `S` of the volume `V`:\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV = ∮_S (f . n_hat) dS`\n\n*   **Volume V**: A sphere of radius R.\n*   **Surface S**: The surface of the sphere of radius R.\n*   **Outward unit normal vector n_hat**: For a sphere centered at the origin, the outward normal vector at any point on the surface is simply the radial unit vector, `n_hat = r_hat`.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Surface Integral**\nLet's compute the dot product `f . n_hat` on the surface `S`:\nOn the surface of the sphere, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n`f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n`n_hat = r_hat`\nTherefore, the dot product is:\n`f . n_hat = ((1/R^2) * r_hat) . r_hat = 1/R^2 * (r_hat . r_hat) = 1/R^2` (since `r_hat . r_hat = 1`)\n\nNow, substitute this into the surface integral:\n`∮_S (f . n_hat) dS = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n\nSince `R` is a constant radius, `1/R^2` is constant over the entire surface `S` and can be taken out of the integral:\n`Integral = (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n\nThe integral `∮_S dS` is simply the total surface area of the sphere. The surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n\n`Integral = (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n`Integral = 4π`\n\n**Alternative Consideration: Direct Calculation of Divergence**\nIf we calculate the divergence of `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat` in spherical coordinates, we find that `∇ . f = 0` for all `r ≠ 0`. However, the field `f` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), and the divergence at this point is undefined in the classical sense. The Divergence Theorem correctly handles this singularity by relating the integral to the flux through the enclosing surface. The non-zero result indicates that there is a \"source\" at the origin, and the divergence is actually a Dirac delta function: `∇ . (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ^3(r)`. Integrating this over a volume containing the origin gives `4π`.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe value of the integral is `4π`.

The integral is represented as `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n2.  **Define the Vector Field:**\n    *   The magnitude of the field is given as `f(r) = 1/r^2`.\n    *   The field has a non-zero component only along the radial direction. This means the field points directly away from (or towards) the origin. Assuming it points outward, the vector field `f` in spherical coordinates is:\n        `f = (1/r^2) * r̂`\n        where `r` is the radial distance and `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n3.  **Define the Volume of Integration:**\n    *   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n4.  **Choose the Method of Solution:**\n    We need to evaluate `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`. There are two main approaches:\n    a)  **Direct Calculation:** First, compute the divergence `∇ ⋅ f`, and then integrate the result over the volume `V`.\n    b)  **Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem):** This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a field to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume `V`. The theorem states:\n        `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\n5.  **Critique the Methods:**\n    *   **Method (a):** Let's try to calculate the divergence of `f` in spherical coordinates. The divergence formula is `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + ...` (other terms are zero since `f_θ` and `f_φ` are zero). Here, `f_r = 1/r^2`.\n        `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`.\n        If the divergence is zero everywhere, the integral would be zero. **However, this is a classic trap.** The field `f = 1/r^2` is singular (undefined) at the origin (`r=0`). The formula for divergence we used is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. The origin is a point source, and the divergence is actually a Dirac delta function at that point. To avoid the complexity of delta functions, the Divergence Theorem is a much safer and more elegant approach.\n\n    *   **Method (b):** Using the Divergence Theorem is ideal because it avoids the singularity at `r=0` by performing the calculation on the surface of the sphere, where `r=R` and the field is well-behaved.\n\n6.  **Executing the Divergence Theorem:**\n    We need to calculate the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n    *   **Surface `S`:** A sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   **Vector Field `f` on the surface:** On the surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, `f = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n    *   **Differential Surface Element `dS`:** For a sphere, the differential area element `dS` always points radially outward. So, its direction is `r̂`. Its magnitude in spherical coordinates is `R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. Therefore, the vector is:\n        `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`.\n    *   **Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`:** Now we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element.\n        `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [(R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂]`\n        Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the expression simplifies significantly:\n        `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2) * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n        Notice that the dependence on the radius `R` has canceled out.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Integral:**\n    Now we integrate `sin(θ) dθ dφ` over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_(φ=0)^(2π) ∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    We can separate the integrals since the integrand does not depend on `φ`:\n    `= (∫_0^(2π) dφ) * (∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ)`\n\n    *   **First integral (φ):** `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π - 0 = 2π`.\n    *   **Second integral (θ):** `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n    Multiplying the results:\n    `Result = (2π) * (2) = 4π`.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of `f` is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`.\n\n9.  **Verification with Code:**\n    The Python code provided in the thinking process calculates the core of the surface integral: `(∫_0^(2π) dφ) * (∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ)`.\n    The code output `12.566370614359172` is the numerical value of `4 * π` (since `π ≈ 3.14159`). This confirms the analytical result.\n\n10. **Final Answer Check:**\n    The result of the integral is `4π`.

Its magnitude in spherical coordinates is `R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n    So, the vector is:\n    `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`\n\n*   **Step 4.3: Calculate the dot product `f ⋅ dS`.**\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [(R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂]`\n    Since `r̂` is a unit vector, `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`.\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2) * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n*   **Step 4.4: Perform the integration over the surface `S`.**\n    To cover the entire surface of the sphere, the limits of integration are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_(φ=0)^(2π) ∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    First, integrate with respect to `θ`:\n    `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    Now, integrate the result with respect to `φ`:\n    `∫_0^(2π) 2 dφ = [2φ]_0^(2π) = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of `f` is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\n**Alternative Check (Direct Calculation and Singularity)**\n\nIf we calculate the divergence of `f = (1/r^2) * r̂` directly using the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates, we get `∇ ⋅ f = 0` for all `r ≠ 0`. However, the field is infinite at `r = 0`. This singularity at the origin is not zero. In physics and mathematics, the divergence of this specific field is known to be a Dirac delta function: `∇ ⋅ (r̂/r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`.\nIntegrating this over the volume gives:\n`∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV = 4π * ∫_V δ³(r) dV`\nSince the volume (the sphere of radius R) contains the origin, the integral of the delta function is 1.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π`\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n**Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe calculated value of the integral is `4π`.

Understand the Problem\nWe are asked to compute the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`.\nThe integral is `I = ∫∫∫_V (∇.f) dV`.\n\n### 2. Define the Vector Field and the Volume\n*   **Vector Field `f`**: The field has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and points radially outward from the origin. In spherical coordinates `(r, θ, φ)`, this can be written as:\n    `f(r, θ, φ) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\n    where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction. The field only has a radial component, `f_r = 1/r^2`, while `f_θ = 0` and `f_φ = 0`.\n\n*   **Volume `V`**: The volume is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin. The surface enclosing this volume, `S`, is the surface of this sphere.\n\n### 3. Choose a Method for Evaluation\nWe have two primary methods to solve this:\n1.  **Direct Calculation**: First compute the divergence `∇.f` and then integrate it over the volume `V`.\n2.  **Divergence Theorem**: Use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's theorem) to convert the volume integral into a surface integral.\n\nThe vector field `f = (1/r^2) * r̂` is singular at the origin `r = 0`. This can make direct evaluation of the volume integral tricky. The Divergence Theorem is often simpler in such cases because it moves the calculation to the boundary surface, avoiding the singularity inside. We will use the Divergence Theorem.\n\n### 4. Apply the Divergence Theorem\nThe Divergence Theorem states:\n`∫∫∫_V (∇.f) dV = ∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nwhere `S` is the closed surface enclosing the volume `V`, and `dS` is the outward-pointing differential surface area vector.\n\n### 5. Evaluate the Surface Integral\n*   **Surface `S`**: The surface is a sphere of radius `R`. On this surface, the radial coordinate `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n\n*   **Vector Field on the Surface**: We evaluate `f` on the surface `S` (where `r=R`):\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n\n*   **Differential Surface Area `dS`**: For a sphere, the differential surface area element in spherical coordinates is `dS = r^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. The direction of the surface element vector `dS` is the outward normal, which is the radial direction `r̂`. So:\n    `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ * r̂`\n\n*   **Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`**: Now we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r̂ ] ⋅ [ R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ * r̂ ]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n*   **Integrate over the Surface `S`**: The surface integral is performed over the entire sphere, so the limits of integration are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    `∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫[from φ=0 to 2π] ∫[from θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    `∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ( ∫[from φ=0 to 2π] dφ ) * ( ∫[from θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ )`\n\n    Evaluate each integral:\n    1.  `∫[from φ=0 to 2π] dφ = [φ]` from 0 to 2π `= 2π - 0 = 2π`\n    2.  `∫[from θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]` from 0 to π `= -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    Multiply the results:\n    `∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n### 6. Conclusion\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of the field is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n`∫∫∫_V (∇.f) dV = 4π`\n\n### Alternative Method (Briefly)\nOne could also calculate the divergence directly. The divergence of `f = (1/r^2) * r̂` is `∇.f = 0` for `r ≠ 0`. However, at the origin `r = 0`, the field is infinite, and the divergence is a Dirac delta function: `∇⋅(r̂/r²) = 4πδ³(r)`.\nThe volume integral becomes:\n`∫∫∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV`\nSince the volume (a sphere of radius R) includes the origin, the integral of the delta function over this volume is 1.\n`∫∫∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π`\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe final answer is `4π`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 4 π\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 0\nD) 1\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe problem asks for the evaluation of the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n**1. Define the Vector Field**\nThe vector field `f(r)` has a magnitude that falls off as `1/r^2` and is directed radially outward from the origin. In spherical coordinates, we can write this vector field as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n**2. Apply the Divergence Theorem**\nThe Divergence Theorem provides a powerful way to solve this problem. It states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the surface integral of the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that bounds the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nThis is particularly useful here because the field `f` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), which is inside the volume of integration. By converting to a surface integral, we perform the calculation on the surface of the sphere where `r=R`, and the field is well-behaved.\n\n**3. Set up the Surface Integral**\n*   **Surface (S):** The surface is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n*   **Vector Field on the Surface (f):** On the surface of this sphere, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is:\n    `f(r=R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n*   **Differential Surface Area Vector (dS):** For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` always points in the radially outward direction, which is the same direction as `r_hat`. The magnitude of `dS` in spherical coordinates is `R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. Therefore, the vector `dS` is:\n    `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`\n*   **Dot Product (f ⋅ dS):** Now we compute the dot product of the field `f` and the surface element `dS`:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat ]`\n    Since the dot product of a unit vector with itself is one (`r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`), the expression simplifies significantly. The `R^2` terms cancel out:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n**4. Evaluate the Integral**\nThe final step is to integrate this result over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are `θ` from 0 to `π` and `φ` from 0 to `2π`:\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_(φ=0)^(2π) ∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nWe can solve this by integrating with respect to `θ` first:\n`∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nNow, we integrate this result with respect to `φ`:\n`∫_0^(2π) 2 dφ = [2φ]_0^(2π) = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe value of the volume integral of the divergence of the field is `4π`. This result corresponds to option D.\n\n(Note: An alternative method involves directly calculating the divergence `∇ ⋅ f`. For `r ≠ 0`, `∇ ⋅ f = 0`. At `r = 0`, the divergence is a Dirac delta function, `∇ ⋅ (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ^3(r)`. Integrating `4πδ^3(r)` over a volume containing the origin also yields `4π`, confirming the result from the Divergence Theorem.)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1.

While this means the conditions for the Divergence Theorem are not strictly met *at that single point*, the theorem can still be used. The physical interpretation is that the total \"source strength\" (the volume integral of the divergence) inside a volume is equal to the total \"flow\" (flux) out of its boundary surface. The singularity at the origin acts as a point source.\n\n**3. Set up the Surface Integral**\n\nWe will calculate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, which is the surface integral (the flux) over the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n*   **The Surface (S):** The surface is a sphere of constant radius `r = R`.\n*   **The Vector Field on the Surface (f):** On this surface, the vector field is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   **The Differential Surface Element (dS):** For a sphere, the differential surface element vector `dS` points radially outward. Its magnitude is the area of a small patch on the surface. In spherical coordinates, this is `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Dot Product `f · dS`**\n\nNow, we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n`f · dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] · [ (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat ]`\n\nThe dot product of the unit vector with itself is `r_hat · r_hat = 1`. The `R^2` terms cancel out:\n`f · dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ * (r_hat · r_hat)`\n`f · dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n**5. Evaluate the Surface Integral**\n\nNow we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere in spherical coordinates are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f · dS) = ∫_φ=0^(2π) ∫_θ=0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nWe can separate the integrals:\n`= ( ∫_0^(2π) dφ ) * ( ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ )`\n\nEvaluate each integral:\n*   `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n*   `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nMultiply the results:\n`∮_S (f · dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n**6.

Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`.\n*   The vector field is given by `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction. The magnitude of the field is `1/r^2`, and it points radially outward.\n*   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n*   The integral to evaluate is `I = ∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n**2. Method 1: Direct Calculation of the Divergence**\n\nLet's first attempt to calculate the divergence of `f` directly using the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + (1/(r*sin(θ))) * ∂(sin(θ) * f_θ)/∂θ + (1/(r*sin(θ))) * ∂(f_φ)/∂φ`\n\nFor our field, `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, the components are:\n*   `f_r = 1/r^2`\n*   `f_θ = 0`\n*   `f_φ = 0`\n\nSubstituting these into the divergence formula:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r + 0 + 0`\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r`\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`\n\nThis calculation suggests that the divergence is zero. If we naively integrate this over the volume, we would get `∫∫∫_V (0) dV = 0`.\n\n**3. The Singularity at the Origin**\n\nThere is a crucial detail to consider. The vector field `f(r) = 1/r^2` is undefined (singular) at the origin (`r = 0`). Our calculation of the divergence is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. Therefore, the divergence is zero everywhere *except* at the origin. This type of problem, with a singularity at a single point, is a classic case for applying the Divergence Theorem.\n\nIn physics, the divergence of this specific field is known to be a Dirac delta function: `∇ ⋅ (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`, where `δ³(r)` is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function, which is zero everywhere except at `r=0`. Integrating this would give `∫∫∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV = 4π`, since the origin is inside our volume of integration.\n\nLet's verify this result using the more general Divergence Theorem.\n\n**4.

So the vector field on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   **The surface element `dS`:** For a sphere, the surface element vector `dS` points in the radial direction, so `dS = dS * r_hat`. In spherical coordinates, the magnitude of the surface element is `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. Therefore, `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ * r_hat`.\n*   **The dot product `f ⋅ dS`:**\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ * r_hat]`\n    The `R^2` terms cancel out, and `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`.\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n*   **The surface integral:** Now we integrate this over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for `θ` are 0 to `π`, and for `φ` are 0 to `2π`.\n    `∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    Let's evaluate the inner integral with respect to `θ`:\n    `∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)](from 0 to π) = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    Now, substitute this back into the outer integral with respect to `φ`:\n    `∫(from 0 to 2π) 2 dφ = [2φ](from 0 to 2π) = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\n**5.

This form strongly suggests the use of the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The Divergence Theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the net flux of the field through the closed surface that encloses the volume. The theorem is stated as:\n    ∫_V (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮_S (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n    Where:\n    *   V is the volume.\n    *   S is the closed surface enclosing the volume V.\n    *   **f** is the vector field.\n    *   ∇ ⋅ **f** is the divergence of the vector field.\n    *   d**S** is the outward-pointing differential surface area vector.\n\n2.  **Define the vector field and the surface:**\n    *   **Vector Field (f):** The problem states that the field has a magnitude of 1/r² and is directed radially. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n        **f** = (1/r²) **r̂**\n        where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   **Volume (V) and Surface (S):** The volume is a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The enclosing surface S is the surface of this sphere.\n\n3.  **Set up the surface integral:**\n    To use the Divergence Theorem, we need to calculate the surface integral ∮_S (**f** ⋅ d**S**).\n    *   First, we evaluate the vector field **f** on the surface S. On the surface of the sphere, the radius r is constant and equal to R.

Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given a vector field `f` that is radial and has a magnitude that falls off as `1/r^2`. This can be written in spherical coordinates as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\nwhere `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nWe need to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`, over a volume `V` which is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**2. Choose a Method: The Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) is the most suitable tool for this problem. It states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume:\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n**Important Note:** The vector field `f` has a singularity at the origin (`r=0`), where its magnitude becomes infinite. Strictly speaking, the Divergence Theorem requires the field to be continuously differentiable everywhere inside the volume. However, we can still use the theorem by understanding that the singularity at the origin acts as a \"source\" of the field.

Understanding the Problem\n\nWe are given a vector field `f(r)` with the following properties:\n*   Its magnitude is `|f(r)| = 1/r^2`, where `r` is the radial distance from the origin.\n*   Its direction is purely radial, pointing away from the origin.\n\nIn spherical coordinates `(r, θ, φ)`, this vector field can be written as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nWe need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∫_V (∇ . f) dV`, where `V` is the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n### 2. Method 1: Direct Calculation of the Divergence\n\nFirst, let's try to calculate the divergence `∇ . f`. The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is:\n`∇ . f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + (1/(r*sin(θ))) * ∂(f_θ * sin(θ))/∂θ + (1/(r*sin(θ))) * ∂(f_φ)/∂φ`\n\nFor our field `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, the components are:\n*   `f_r = 1/r^2`\n*   `f_θ = 0`\n*   `f_φ = 0`\n\nSubstituting these into the divergence formula:\n`∇ . f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r + 0 + 0`\n`∇ . f = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r`\n`∇ . f = (1/r^2) * 0`\n`∇ . f = 0`\n\nThis calculation seems to suggest that the divergence is zero everywhere. If this were true, the volume integral `∫_V (0) dV` would also be zero.\n\n**However, there is a critical point to consider:** The vector field `f(r) = 1/r^2` is undefined at the origin (`r = 0`). The calculation above is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. The origin is a singularity, and we cannot ignore it because it is inside our volume of integration.\n\n### 3. Method 2: Using the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)\n\nA more robust way to solve this problem, especially when singularities are involved, is to use the Divergence Theorem. The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume:\n\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n*   **Volume `V`**: A sphere of radius `R`.\n*   **Surface `S`**: The spherical surface of radius `R`.\n*   **Vector Field `f`**: On the surface `S`, `r = R`, so `f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   **Surface Element `dS`**: The differential surface vector `dS` is a vector whose magnitude is the area of the surface element and whose direction is the outward-pointing normal. For a sphere, the outward normal is always in the radial direction, so `n_hat = r_hat`. The magnitude of the surface element in spherical coordinates is `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`. Therefore, `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`.\n\nNow, we calculate the dot product `f . dS`:\n`f . dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] . [ (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat ]`\nSince `r_hat . r_hat = 1`:\n`f . dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ)`\n`f . dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nNext, we integrate this over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f . dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nLet's evaluate the integral:\n1.  Integrate with respect to `θ`:\n    `∫_{0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_{0}^{π} = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n2.  Integrate the result with respect to `φ`:\n    `∫_{φ=0}^{2π} 2 dφ = 2 * [φ]_{0}^{2π} = 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π`\n\nThus, the value of the integral is `4π`.\n\n### 4. Reconciling the Methods and Conclusion\n\nThe Divergence Theorem gives the answer `4π`, while the direct calculation of the divergence (which was flawed because it ignored the singularity) suggested `0`. The correct approach is using the Divergence Theorem, which properly handles the \"source\" at the origin by converting the volume integral into a surface integral where the field is well-behaved.\n\nThis problem is a classic example from physics, analogous to Gauss's Law for a point charge at the origin. The divergence of the field `r_hat / r^2` is actually a Dirac delta function, `∇ . (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ(r)`, which is zero everywhere except at the origin, but its integral over any volume containing the origin is `4π`.\n\nThe result `4π` is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere (as long as `R > 0`), which makes physical sense: the total \"source strength\" is contained at the origin, so any sphere enclosing it should measure the same total flux.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 4 π\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 0\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Vector Field and the Volume:**\n    *   The vector field is given by its magnitude `f(r) = 1/r^2` and its direction, which is purely radial.

The theorem states: `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`. This converts a volume integral into a surface integral over the boundary surface `S` of the volume `V`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Divergence Directly (and why it's tricky):**\n*   The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r`.\n*   Here, the radial component `f_r` is `1/r^2`.\n*   So, `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`.\n*   This result `∇ ⋅ f = 0` is valid for all `r ≠ 0`. However, at the origin (`r = 0`), the field `f(r)` is singular (1/0 is undefined). The divergence is not zero at this point; it is a Dirac delta function. A naive integration of `0` over the volume would incorrectly yield `0`. The Divergence Theorem elegantly handles this singularity.\n\n**3. Apply the Divergence Theorem:**\n*   The volume integral `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV` is equal to the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n*   **Surface `S`:** The surface is the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   **Vector Field `f` on the surface `S`:** At any point on the surface, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, `f = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n*   **Differential Surface Element `dS`:** For a sphere, the area element `dS` points radially outward. Its magnitude is `R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`. As a vector, `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r̂`.\n*   **Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`:** Now we compute the dot product to find the flux through the differential area element.\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [(R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r̂]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`.\n    Notice how the `R^2` terms cancel out, making the result independent of the sphere's radius `R`.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Surface Integral:**\n*   We need to integrate `sin(θ) dθ dφ` over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_0^(2π) ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n*   The integral is separable:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (∫_0^(2π) dφ) * (∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ)`\n*   Evaluate each part:\n    *   `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π - 0 = 2π`.\n    *   `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n*   Multiply the results:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n*   By the Divergence Theorem, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = 4π`.\n*   This result is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism (Gauss's Law for a point charge). The field described is analogous to the electric field of a point charge at the origin.\n*   Comparing the result `4π` with the given options:\n    A) 1\n    B) 4 π\n    C) 4/3 π R\n    D) 0\n*   The most appropriate answer is B.\n\nThe reasoning is complete and the result is confirmed by standard physics principles. No further calculation or search is needed.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThis problem asks for the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n**1. The Vector Field and the Integral**\n\nThe vector field is given by its magnitude `f(r) = 1/r^2` and its direction, which is purely radial. In spherical coordinates, this is expressed as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\nwhere `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nThe volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**2. Choosing the Right Method: The Divergence Theorem**\n\nWe need to calculate `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` gives `0` for all `r ≠ 0`. However, at the origin (`r = 0`), the field is infinite (a singularity), and the divergence is undefined. Since the integration volume includes this singularity, we cannot simply conclude the integral is `0`.\n\nThe most appropriate tool for this problem is the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). It states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface that encloses the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n**3. Calculating the Surface Integral (Flux)**\n\nWe will evaluate the right-hand side of the theorem, which is the flux through the spherical surface.\n\n*   **On the surface `S`**, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So the field is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n*   **The differential surface area vector `dS`** for a sphere points radially outward. Its magnitude is `R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. So, `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`.\n\nNow, we compute the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n`f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r̂ ] ⋅ [ (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂ ]`\n\nThe `R^2` terms cancel. The dot product of the radial unit vector with itself is `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`.\n`f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nNext, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The integration limits for the angle `θ` are from `0` to `π`, and for the angle `φ` are from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nThis integral evaluates to `4π`. The previous step confirmed this result using a Python script, which returned `4*pi`.\n\n*   **Inner integral:** `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -(-1) - (-1) = 2`\n*   **Outer integral:** `∫_0^{2π} 2 dφ = 2 * [φ]_0^{2π} = 2(2π) = 4π`\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nBy the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral of the flux.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere.\n\nComparing this result with the options provided:\nA) 4/3 π R\nB) 4 π\nC) 0\nD) 1\n\nThe most appropriate answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\nWe are given a vector field **f**(r) with the following properties:\n*   Its magnitude is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the origin: |**f**(r)| = f(r) = 1/r².\n*   Its direction is purely radial, pointing away from the origin.\n\nWe need to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of this field (∫∫∫ ∇·**f** dV) over a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\n### 2. Expressing the Vector Field\n\nIn spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ), a purely radial vector field can be written as:\n**f**(r) = f(r) * **r̂**\nwhere **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\nGiven that f(r) = 1/r², the vector field is:\n**f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**\n\nThis field is analogous to the electric field of a unit point charge at the origin or the gravitational field of a unit mass at the origin (ignoring constants and signs).\n\n### 3. Method 1: Direct Calculation of Divergence (with a caveat)\n\nThe formula for the divergence of a vector field **A** = Aᵣ **r̂** + A_θ **θ̂** + A_φ **φ̂** in spherical coordinates is:\n∇·**A** = (1/r²) ∂/∂r (r² Aᵣ) + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂/∂θ (sinθ A_θ) + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂/∂φ (A_φ)\n\nFor our field **f**(r), we have:\n*   Aᵣ = fᵣ = 1/r²\n*   A_θ = 0\n*   A_φ = 0\n\nSubstituting these into the divergence formula:\n∇·**f** = (1/r²) ∂/∂r (r² * (1/r²)) + 0 + 0\n∇·**f** = (1/r²) ∂/∂r (1)\n∇·**f** = (1/r²) * 0 = 0\n\nThis calculation seems to imply that the divergence is zero everywhere. If we integrate zero over the volume, the result would be 0.\n`∫∫∫ (0) dV = 0`\n\n**However, this is incorrect.** The vector field **f**(r) = 1/r² is singular (undefined) at the origin (r=0). Our calculation of the divergence is only valid for r ≠ 0. The point r=0, which is a point of infinite divergence (a \"source\"), is included in our integration volume. Therefore, we cannot simply conclude the integral is zero.\n\n### 4. Method 2: Using the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)\n\nA more robust way to solve this problem, especially with a singularity at the origin, is to use the Divergence Theorem. The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V is equal to the flux of that field through the closed surface S that bounds the volume:\n\n∫∫∫_V (∇·**f**) dV = ∮_S (**f** · d**S**)\n\n*   **V** is the volume of the sphere of radius R.\n*   **S** is the surface of the sphere of radius R.\n*   **f** is our vector field, **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**.\n*   d**S** is the differential surface area vector. For a sphere of radius r, its direction is radially outward, so d**S** = dS **r̂**. The magnitude dS in spherical coordinates is r² sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n\nNow, we evaluate the surface integral (flux) over the sphere of radius R:\n∮_S (**f** · d**S**)\n\nOn the surface of the sphere, the radius r is constant and equal to R. So, we evaluate **f** at r=R:\n**f**(r=R) = (1/R²) **r̂**\n\nThe differential surface element on this sphere is:\nd**S** = (R² sinθ dθ dφ) **r̂**\n\nNow we compute the dot product **f** · d**S**:\n**f** · d**S** = [(1/R²) **r̂**] · [(R² sinθ dθ dφ) **r̂**]\nSince **r̂** · **r̂** = 1, the dot product simplifies to:\n**f** · d**S** = (1/R²) * (R² sinθ dθ dφ) = sinθ dθ dφ\n\nNow, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for a full sphere are θ from 0 to π, and φ from 0 to 2π.\n\n∮_S (**f** · d**S**) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sinθ dθ dφ\n\nLet's evaluate the integral. We can separate the variables:\n= [∫(from φ=0 to 2π) dφ] * [∫(from θ=0 to π) sinθ dθ]\n\nEvaluating the first integral:\n∫(from φ=0 to 2π) dφ = [φ] from 0 to 2π = 2π - 0 = 2π\n\nEvaluating the second integral:\n∫(from θ=0 to π) sinθ dθ = [-cosθ] from 0 to π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nMultiplying the results:\n∮_S (**f** · d**S**) = (2π) * (2) = 4π\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, this surface integral is equal to the volume integral of the divergence:\n∫∫∫_V (∇·**f**) dV = 4π\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe divergence of the field is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it is a singularity. This singularity represents a source. The Divergence Theorem allows us to find the total \"strength\" of this source by measuring the total flux leaving the enclosing surface.

Integrating 4πδ³(**r**) over a volume that includes the origin gives 4π, confirming the result from the Divergence Theorem.*\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define the Vector Field**\n\nThe problem states that the vector field `f(r)` falls off radially as `1/r^2`. This means:\n*   The field has a component only in the radial direction (`r_hat`).\n*   The magnitude of the field is `|f(r)| = 1/r^2`.\n\nSo, we can write the vector field `f` in spherical coordinates as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n**2. Identify the Goal**\n\nWe need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field:\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV`\nwhere `V` is the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**3. Choose the Method: Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe vector field `f(r)` has a singularity at the origin (`r=0`), where the magnitude `1/r^2` goes to infinity. Directly calculating the divergence `∇ . f` can be tricky because of this singularity.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem is the ideal tool for this situation. It relates the volume integral of the divergence to a surface integral over the boundary of the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV = ∮_S (f . n_hat) dS`\n\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `n_hat` is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the surface `S`. For a sphere, this is simply the radial unit vector, `n_hat = r_hat`.\n*   `dS` is the differential surface area element.\n\nThe advantage of this theorem is that the surface integral is evaluated on the surface of the sphere (`r=R`), where the field is well-behaved and finite.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Surface Integral**\n\nLet's compute the components of the surface integral `∮_S (f . n_hat) dS`.\n\n*   **Calculate the dot product `(f . n_hat)`:**\n    `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n    `n_hat = r_hat`\n    `f . n_hat = ((1/r^2) * r_hat) . r_hat = 1/r^2` (since `r_hat . r_hat = 1`)\n\n*   **Evaluate the dot product on the surface `S`:**\n    The surface `S` is a sphere of radius `R`. On this entire surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n    So, on the surface, `f . n_hat = 1/R^2`.\n\n*   **Set up and solve the integral:**\n    `∮_S (f . n_hat) dS = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n    Since `1/R^2` is a constant with respect to the surface integration, we can pull it out of the integral:\n    `= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n\n*   **Interpret the remaining integral `∮_S dS`:**\n    This integral is simply the total surface area of the sphere `S`. The surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is given by the formula `4πR^2`.\n\n*   **Final Calculation:**\n    `= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n    `= 4π`\n\n**5.

(r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`, where `δ³(r)` is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function. The integral of the delta function over a volume containing the origin is 1. Therefore, `∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π`. This confirms the result from the Divergence Theorem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere's my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The request is to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f` over a specific volume `V`.\n    *   Integral: `I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`\n    *   Vector Field: `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`. This means the field has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and points radially outward from the origin.\n    *   Volume: `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n2.  **Initial Approach: Direct Calculation:**\n    My first thought might be to calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` and then integrate it over the volume.\n    The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is:\n    `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + (1/(r*sin(θ))) * ∂(sin(θ) * f_θ)/∂θ + (1/(r*sin(θ))) * ∂(f_φ)/∂φ`\n    In this problem, the field `f` is purely radial:\n    *   `f_r = 1/r^2` (radial component)\n    *   `f_θ = 0` (polar component)\n    *   `f_φ = 0` (azimuthal component)\n    Substituting these into the divergence formula:\n    `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r`\n    `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r`\n    `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`\n    This calculation shows that the divergence is zero *everywhere except at the origin (r=0)*. At `r=0`, the field `f` itself is infinite (`1/0^2`), so the divergence is undefined.\n\n3.  **Identify the Problem:** If we just integrate `∇ ⋅ f = 0` over the volume, we get `∫ 0 dV = 0`. This is suspicious because it ignores the fact that something special is happening at the origin. A single point has zero volume, so its contribution to a standard Riemann integral is zero. However, in physics and advanced calculus, such singularities (often representing sources like charges or masses) have a finite, non-zero effect. The field is singular, which suggests we need a more powerful tool.\n\n4.  **Second Approach: The Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem):**\n    This theorem is perfect for this situation. It relates a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the field itself.\n    The theorem states: `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    Where `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V`.\n    *   **Caveat:** The Divergence Theorem requires the vector field `f` to be continuously differentiable throughout the entire volume `V`. In our case, `f` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), which is inside our volume.\n    *   **Resolution:** This is a classic textbook case. The standard way to handle this is to proceed by applying the theorem, understanding that it correctly accounts for the \"source\" at the singularity. The integral of the divergence is interpreted as the net flux out of the volume, which is exactly what the surface integral calculates. In a more rigorous proof, one would exclude an infinitesimally small sphere around the origin from the volume of integration and show that the surface integral over this small inner sphere accounts for the singularity, leading to the same result.\n\n5.  **Applying the Divergence Theorem:**\n    Let's calculate the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n    *   **Surface S:** The surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   **Vector Field on the Surface:** On the surface `S`, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    *   **Differential Surface Element dS:** For a sphere, a small patch of area has a normal vector that points radially outward. So, `dS` is also in the `r_hat` direction. Its magnitude is the area of the patch, which in spherical coordinates is `dA = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n        Therefore, `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`.\n    *   **Dot Product:** Now we compute `f ⋅ dS`:\n        `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat ]`\n        `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2) * sin(θ) dθ dφ * (r_hat ⋅ r_hat)`\n        Since `r_hat` is a unit vector, `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`.\n        `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n6.  **Performing the Integration:**\n    Now we integrate this result over the entire surface of the sphere.

This means the vector field can be written as `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   The volume of integration is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n    *   The integral to evaluate is `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n2.  **Choose the Right Tool: The Divergence Theorem**\n    The Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) provides a powerful way to relate a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the vector field itself. The theorem states:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    Where:\n    *   `V` is the volume (the sphere of radius R).\n    *   `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V` (the surface of the sphere of radius R).\n    *   `dS` is the differential surface area vector, which points outward from the surface.\n\n    This theorem is particularly useful here because the vector field `f` has a singularity at the origin (`r=0`), where it is undefined. Calculating the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly would involve the Dirac delta function (`∇ ⋅ (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`), which can be tricky. Using the surface integral bypasses this complication.\n\n3.  **Set up the Surface Integral**\n    We need to evaluate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n    *   **The Surface `S`**: This is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`. On this surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n    *   **The Vector Field `f` on the Surface**: We substitute `r=R` into the expression for `f`. So, on the surface `S`, `f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    *   **The Differential Surface Area Vector `dS`**: For a sphere, the differential surface area element in spherical coordinates is `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. The direction of this area element is normal to the surface, which is the radial direction `r_hat`. So, `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`**\n    Now we take the dot product of the vector field `f` on the surface and the differential surface area vector `dS`:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat ]`\n    Since the dot product of a unit vector with itself is 1 (`r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`), the expression simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integral**\n    Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. In spherical coordinates, this means integrating with respect to `θ` from `0` to `π` and with respect to `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    First, we evaluate the inner integral with respect to `θ`:\n    `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    Now, we substitute this result into the outer integral with respect to `φ`:\n    `∫_{φ=0}^{2π} (2) dφ = [2φ]_0^{2π} = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of `f` is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\n    The result `4π` is a constant and is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere. This is because the `1/r^2` decrease in the field's magnitude is perfectly offset by the `r^2` increase in the surface area of the sphere.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 4/3 π R\nB) 0\nC) 4 π\nD) 1\n\nThe calculated answer is `4π`, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nThis problem requires us to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of a given vector field over a sphere of radius R.\n\n**1. Define the Vector Field**\nThe problem states that the vector field `f(r)` has a magnitude that falls off as `1/r^2` and is directed radially outwards from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n`f = (1/r^2) * r̂`\nwhere `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n**2. Identify the Goal**\nWe need to evaluate the volume integral:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`\nwhere `V` is the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**3. Choose the Method: The Divergence Theorem**\nThe Divergence Theorem provides a powerful way to solve this. It relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface enclosing the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dA)`\nwhere `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n**Why the Divergence Theorem is appropriate here:**\nA direct calculation of the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` runs into a problem. The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates for a field `f = f_r * r̂` is:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r`\nFor our field, `f_r = 1/r^2`. So,\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`\nThis calculation is valid for all `r > 0`. However, at the origin `(r = 0)`, the field `f` is infinite, creating a singularity. The divergence is undefined at this single point. The Divergence Theorem elegantly handles this by converting the volume integral (which contains the singularity) into a surface integral (which is on the boundary `r = R`, where the field is well-behaved). The contribution from the singularity at the origin is captured by the flux through the enclosing surface. This is the essence of Gauss's Law in electromagnetism.\n\n**4. Apply the Divergence Theorem**\n\n*   **The vector field on the surface:** On the surface of the sphere `S`, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So the field `f` on the surface is:\n    `f(r=R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n\n*   **The differential surface area vector:** For a sphere, the differential area element `dA` is a vector that points radially outward (in the direction of `r̂`) and has a magnitude of `R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n    `dA = r̂ * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n*   **Calculate the dot product `f ⋅ dA`:**\n    `f ⋅ dA = [ (1/R^2) * r̂ ] ⋅ [ r̂ * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ ]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dA = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n*   **Integrate over the surface `S`:** Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are `φ` from `0` to `2π` and `θ` from `0` to `π`.\n\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dA) = ∫(φ=0 to 2π) ∫(θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    `= [ ∫(φ=0 to 2π) dφ ] * [ ∫(θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ ]`\n\n    Evaluate each integral:\n    `∫(φ=0 to 2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π`\n    `∫(θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    Multiply the results:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dA) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n**5.

So, `n_hat = r_hat`.\n\n*   **f on the surface S:** We need to evaluate the vector field `f` on the surface of the sphere, where the radial distance `r` is equal to `R`.\n    `f(at r=R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n\n*   **The Dot Product (f ⋅ n_hat):** Now we compute the dot product of the field on the surface and the normal vector.\n    `f ⋅ n_hat = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [r_hat]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = |r_hat|^2 = 1`, the dot product is:\n    `f ⋅ n_hat = 1/R^2`\n    Notice that this value is a constant everywhere on the surface of the sphere.\n\n*   **The Surface Integral:** Now we can perform the integration.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ n_hat) dS = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n    Since `1/R^2` is a constant with respect to the surface integration, we can pull it out of the integral:\n    `= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n    The integral `∮_S dS` simply means \"sum up all the small surface elements `dS` over the entire surface `S`\", which gives the total surface area of the sphere.\n    The surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n    So, the integral becomes:\n    `= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n\n*   **Final Result:** The `R^2` terms cancel out.\n    `= 4π`\n\n**4.

Therefore, we can find the value of the volume integral by calculating the flux integral `∬_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Flux Integral `∬_S (f ⋅ dS)`:**\n    *   **Surface `S`:** The surface is a sphere of constant radius `r = R`.\n    *   **Field on the Surface `f(S)`:** On the surface of the sphere, the vector field is `f = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n    *   **Surface Element `dS`:** For a sphere, the differential area element `dS` points radially outward.

Understanding the Vector Field\n\nThe problem describes a vector field `f(r)` with the following properties:\n*   Its magnitude is `|f(r)| = 1/r^2`, where `r` is the distance from the origin.\n*   Its direction is purely radial, pointing away from the origin.\n\nIn spherical coordinates, we can write this vector field as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n### 2. The Problem Statement\n\nWe need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∇ ⋅ f`, over the volume `V` of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\nThe integral to be calculated is:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`\n\n### 3. Choosing the Method: The Divergence Theorem\n\nThis problem is a classic application of the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses that volume.\n\nMathematically:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`, and `S` is its surface.\n\n**Important Note:** The Divergence Theorem requires the vector field to be well-behaved (continuously differentiable) everywhere inside the volume `V`. Our field `f(r) = r_hat / r^2` has a singularity at the origin (`r = 0`), where it is undefined. However, the theorem can still be used to find the answer by considering the flux through the boundary surface, which cleverly avoids the point of singularity. This is a standard technique for dealing with such problems, especially in contexts like electrostatics (e.g., Gauss's Law for a point charge).\n\n### 4. Applying the Divergence Theorem\n\nWe will calculate the right-hand side of the theorem: the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   **Surface `S`**: This is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`. On this surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n*   **Vector Field `f` on the surface**: At any point on the surface `S`, `r = R`. So the field is `f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   **Surface Element `dS`**: For a sphere, the differential surface element vector `dS` always points radially outward. Therefore, `dS = dS * r_hat`, where `dS` is the magnitude of the surface element area.\n*   **The Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`**: We compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [dS * r_hat]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, this simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * dS`\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Integral\n\nNow we can substitute this back into the surface integral:\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n\nSince `R` is the constant radius of the sphere, `1/R^2` is a constant and can be taken out of the integral:\n`= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n\nThe integral `∮_S dS` simply means summing up all the differential surface areas over the entire surface of the sphere. This is, by definition, the total surface area of the sphere.\nThe surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n\nSo, we have:\n`= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n\nThe `R^2` terms cancel out:\n`= 4π`\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\nBy the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral (flux) we just calculated.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThe result is a constant value, `4π`, independent of the radius `R` of the sphere (as long as `R > 0`, so that the singularity at the origin is enclosed).\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 1\nD) 4 π\n\nThe calculated answer matches option D.\n\n(Self-reflection: An attempt to calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly would yield 0 for `r > 0`. This is misleading because it ignores the singularity at `r=0`. The divergence at the origin is actually a Dirac delta function, `∇ ⋅ (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ^3(r)`. Integrating `4πδ^3(r)` over a volume containing the origin gives `4π`, confirming the result obtained using the Divergence Theorem.)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Vector Field**\n\nThe problem describes a vector field `f(r)` that has the following properties:\n*   It is directed radially outward from the origin.\n*   Its magnitude depends only on the distance `r` from the origin and is given by `f(r) = 1/r^2`.\n\nIn spherical coordinates `(r, θ, φ)`, we can express this vector field as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\nwhere `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction. This means the field has a radial component `f_r = 1/r^2`, and its other components are zero (`f_θ = 0`, `f_φ = 0`).\n\n### **2. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe need to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∇ ⋅ f`, over the volume `V` of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\nThe integral to evaluate is: `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n### **3. Method 1: Using the Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem provides a powerful way to solve this problem. It relates a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the field itself:\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nwhere `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V`. In this case, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\nLet's evaluate the surface integral on the right-hand side:\n\n*   **The vector field `f` on the surface `S`:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the field `f` on the surface is `f = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n*   **The surface element vector `dS`:** For a sphere, the infinitesimal surface element vector `dS` points in the direction of the outward normal. The outward normal to a sphere is simply the radial unit vector `r̂`. So, `dS = dS * r̂`, where `dS` is the magnitude of the area element.\n*   **The dot product `f ⋅ dS`:**\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [dS * r̂]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * dS`\n*   **The surface integral:**\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∮_S (1/R^2) * dS`\n    Since `R` is a constant over the entire surface of integration, we can take `1/R^2` outside the integral:\n    `= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n*   **Final evaluation:** The integral `∮_S dS` is simply the total surface area of the sphere. The surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n    Therefore, the value of the integral is:\n    `= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2) = 4π`\n\nSo, by the Divergence Theorem, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`.\n\n### **4. Method 2: Direct Calculation of the Divergence (Conceptual Check)**\n\nLet's try to calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly. The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + (terms involving f_θ and f_φ)`\n\nSince `f_θ = f_φ = 0`, the formula simplifies to:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r`\n\nSubstitute `f_r = 1/r^2`:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`\n\nThis calculation shows that the divergence is zero *everywhere except at the origin (r=0)*. At `r=0`, the field `f` is undefined (it blows up), and so is its divergence. This type of field, which is analogous to the electric field of a point charge, has a \"source\" at the origin. The divergence at this point is not zero; it is a three-dimensional Dirac delta function:\n`∇ ⋅ (r̂/r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`\n\nNow, we can evaluate the volume integral:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV`\n\nBy the definition of the Dirac delta function, integrating it over a volume that contains the origin (`r=0`) yields 1. Since the sphere of radius `R` is centered at the origin, it contains the point `r=0`.\n`∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV = 4π * ∫_V δ³(r) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π`\n\nBoth methods give the same result.

In spherical coordinates, a purely radial vector field can be written as `f = f_r * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    Given the magnitude, the vector field is:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`, where `V` is the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n3.  **Choose the Method:**\n    We can attempt to calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly and then integrate it. However, the field `f(r) = 1/r^2 * r_hat` is singular at the origin (`r = 0`), which is inside our volume of integration. A naive calculation of the divergence might miss the contribution from this singularity.\n    A more robust method is to use the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of the field through the closed surface that bounds the volume:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    Here, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`. This method is particularly useful because the surface `S` is at `r = R`, where the field `f` is well-behaved (not singular).\n\n4.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:**\n    *   **Vector Field on the Surface (S):** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is:\n        `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n\n    *   **Differential Surface Area Vector (dS):** For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` points in the outward normal direction, which is the radial direction `r_hat`. Its magnitude is `R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`. Therefore:\n        `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat`\n\n    *   **Compute the Dot Product (f ⋅ dS):** Now we compute the dot product of the field and the surface area element on the surface of the sphere:\n        `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat]`\n        `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * (r_hat ⋅ r_hat)`\n        Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the dot product simplifies to:\n        `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n        Notice that the `R^2` terms cancel out.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Surface Integral:**\n    Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere in spherical coordinates are `φ` from `0` to `2π` and `θ` from `0` to `π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫[φ=0 to 2π] ∫[θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (∫[φ=0 to 2π] dφ) * (∫[θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ)`\n    Let's evaluate each integral:\n    *   `∫[φ=0 to 2π] dφ = [φ] from 0 to 2π = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n    *   `∫[θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)] from 0 to π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    Multiplying the results:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\n    *(Note: A direct calculation of the divergence gives `∇ ⋅ f = 0` for `r ≠ 0`. The result `4π` comes entirely from the contribution of the singularity at the origin, which is properly captured by the Divergence Theorem. The divergence is actually a Dirac delta function: `∇ ⋅ (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`.

We can solve it using two main methods: the Divergence Theorem or direct calculation. The Divergence Theorem is generally more straightforward, especially when dealing with singularities.\n\n### Method 1: Using the Divergence Theorem\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f` over a volume `V` is equal to the surface integral of the field over the closed surface `S` that bounds the volume:\n\n∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)\n\n1.  **Identify the vector field and the surface:**\n    *   The vector field is given as radial with magnitude `1/r^2`. In vector notation, `f = (1/r^2) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   The volume is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n    *   The bounding surface `S` is the surface of this sphere.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the surface integral ∮_S (f ⋅ dS):**\n    *   On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So the field on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n    *   The differential surface area element `dS` for a sphere also points in the radial direction (outward normal). In spherical coordinates, `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`.\n    *   Now, we compute the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n        `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [(R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂]`\n        Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies significantly:\n        `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n3.  **Perform the integration over the entire surface:**\n    The limits for a full sphere are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    ∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_φ=0^(2π) ∫_θ=0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\n    *   First, integrate with respect to `θ`:\n        ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2\n\n    *   Now, integrate the result with respect to `φ`:\n        ∫_0^(2π) 2 dφ = 2 * [φ]_0^(2π) = 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π\n\nTherefore, by the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is `4π`.\n\n### Method 2: Direct Calculation (and its pitfall)\n\n1.  **Calculate the divergence ∇ ⋅ f:**\n    In spherical coordinates, the divergence is `∇⋅f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * f_r)`.\n    Here, the radial component of the field is `f_r = 1/r^2`.\n    `∇⋅f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * (1/r^2)) = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (1) = 0`\n\n2.  **The Singularity at the Origin:**\n    This result `∇⋅f = 0` is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. At the origin (`r = 0`), the field `1/r^2` is infinite, so it's a singularity. A naive integration of `0` over the volume would incorrectly yield `0`. The divergence at the origin is not zero; it is a Dirac delta function. For this specific field, it can be shown that `∇⋅(r̂/r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`, where `δ³(r)` is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function which is non-zero only at the origin.\n\n3.  **Integrate the divergence including the delta function:**\n    ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV\n    By the definition of the delta function, this integral is `4π` if the origin is inside the volume of integration (which it is, as the sphere is centered at the origin) and `0` otherwise.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, `4π`.

This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\nWe are asked to compute the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\nThe vector field `f` is defined as:\n*   Its magnitude is `|f| = 1/r^2`, where `r` is the radial distance from the origin.\n*   It points purely in the radial direction.\n\nIn spherical coordinates `(r, θ, φ)`, the unit vector in the radial direction is `r̂`. So, the vector field can be written as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) r̂`\n\nThe volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n### 2. Method 1: Direct Calculation of Divergence (with a caveat)\n\nFirst, let's try to calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly. The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field `f = f_r r̂ + f_θ θ̂ + f_φ φ̂` is:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + (1/(r sinθ)) * ∂(f_θ sinθ)/∂θ + (1/(r sinθ)) * ∂(f_φ)/∂φ`\n\nIn our case, `f_r = 1/r^2`, and `f_θ = 0`, `f_φ = 0`. Plugging these in:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r + 0 + 0`\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r`\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`\n\nThis calculation suggests that the divergence is zero. If we integrate `0` over any volume, the result would be `0`.\n\nHowever, this result is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. At the origin `r = 0`, the field `f` is singular (1/0 is undefined). The standard formula for divergence cannot be applied at this point. The divergence is actually non-zero at the origin in a special way (it's a Dirac delta function), and this single point contributes to the entire value of the integral. To handle this singularity correctly, we should use the Divergence Theorem.\n\n### 3. Method 2: Using the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)\n\nThe Divergence Theorem provides a more robust way to solve this problem. It states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface that bounds the volume:\n\n`∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `S` is the surface of this sphere.\n*   `dS` is the outward-pointing differential surface area vector.\n\nLet's evaluate the surface integral (the right-hand side of the theorem).\n\n1.  **The vector field `f` on the surface `S`**: On the surface of the sphere, the radius is constant, `r = R`. So the field is:\n    `f = (1/R^2) r̂`\n\n2.  **The surface element `dS`**: For a sphere of radius `R`, the differential surface element in spherical coordinates is:\n    `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ r̂`\n    The direction `r̂` is radially outward, which is the correct orientation for the Divergence Theorem.\n\n3.  **The dot product `f ⋅ dS`**:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) r̂ ] ⋅ [ R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ r̂ ]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, this simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    Notice that the `R^2` terms have conveniently cancelled out.\n\n4.  **The surface integral `∮∮_S`**: Now we integrate `f ⋅ dS` over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are `φ` from `0` to `2π`, and `θ` from `0` to `π`.\n\n    `∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫[from φ=0 to 2π] ∫[from θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    Let's evaluate the integrals:\n    *   Inner integral (with respect to `θ`):\n        `∫[from 0 to π] sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)] [from 0 to π]`\n        `= -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    *   Outer integral (with respect to `φ`):\n        `∫[from 0 to 2π] 2 dφ = [2φ] [from 0 to 2π]`\n        `= 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\nSo, the surface integral is `4π`.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem:\n`∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = 4π`\n\nThis is a classic result in physics (related to Gauss's Law for a point charge), where the singularity at the origin acts as a \"source\" of divergence. The total divergence contained within any sphere enclosing the origin is `4π`, regardless of the sphere's radius `R`.\n\nComparing our result to the options:\nA) 4/3 π R\nB) 1\nC) 4 π\nD) 0\n\nThe correct answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`.\n*   **Vector Field `f`**: The field has a magnitude `|f(r)| = 1/r^2` and points radially outward from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this is expressed as:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\n    where `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r̂` is the radial unit vector.\n\n*   **Volume of Integration `V`**: The volume is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n*   **Integral to Evaluate**: We need to compute `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n### 2. Choosing the Method\n\nThis problem can be solved in two main ways:\n1.  By directly calculating the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` and then integrating it over the volume `V`.\n2.  By using the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) to convert the volume integral into a surface integral.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem is generally simpler for this type of problem.\n\n### 3. Applying the Divergence Theorem\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that for a vector field `f`, the integral of its divergence over a volume `V` is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that bounds the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\n**Important Consideration**: The Divergence Theorem requires the vector field `f` to be continuously differentiable everywhere inside the volume `V`. In our case, the field `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂` is singular (undefined) at the origin (`r = 0`). Since the sphere is centered at the origin, this singularity is inside our volume.\n\nHowever, the theorem can still be applied. The value of the volume integral is determined by the flux through the bounding surface. This method correctly accounts for the contribution of the singularity at the origin. This is a cornerstone of Gauss's Law in electromagnetism, which deals with an identical mathematical structure.\n\nLet's proceed with the surface integral:\n\n*   **Surface `S`**: The surface is the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   **Vector Field on the Surface**: At any point on the surface `S`, the radial distance is `r = R`. So the vector field is:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n*   **Differential Surface Element `dS`**: For a sphere, the differential surface element in spherical coordinates is a vector that points radially outward (in the direction of `r̂`). Its magnitude is `R^2 sinθ dθ dφ`. So,\n    `dS = (R^2 sinθ dθ dφ) * r̂`\n*   **The Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`**: Now we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [(R^2 sinθ dθ dφ) * r̂]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2) * sinθ dθ dφ`\n    `f ⋅ dS = sinθ dθ dφ`\n    Notice that the dependence on the radius `R` has canceled out.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Surface Integral**: We now integrate `f ⋅ dS` over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for spherical coordinates are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_0^(2π) ∫_0^π sinθ dθ dφ`\n\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    `= (∫_0^(2π) dφ) * (∫_0^π sinθ dθ)`\n\n    Evaluate each part:\n    `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n    `∫_0^π sinθ dθ = [-cosθ]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    Multiply the results:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n### 4. Alternative Method (Confirmation via Dirac Delta)\n\nFor completeness, let's consider the direct evaluation of the divergence. The divergence of the field `f(r) = r̂/r^2` is known to be zero everywhere except at the origin, where it is a singularity. This singularity can be expressed using the three-dimensional Dirac delta function `δ³(r)`:\n`∇ ⋅ f = ∇ ⋅ (r̂/r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`\n\nThe volume integral is then:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV`\n\nBy the definition of the Dirac delta function, integrating it over a volume that contains the origin (`r=0`) yields the value of the function multiplying it (in this case, the constant `4π`).\n`∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV = 4π`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe volume integral of the divergence of the given field is `4π`. This corresponds to option C.\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 4 π\nD) 0\n\nThe most appropriate answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### **1.

In vector notation using spherical coordinates, this is `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n*   **Volume of Integration (V):** The volume is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n*   **The Integral:** We need to evaluate `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n### **2. Choose the Method: The Divergence Theorem**\n\nDirectly calculating the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` and then integrating over the volume can be tricky because the field `f` is singular (goes to infinity) at the origin `r=0`.\n\nA much more elegant approach is to use the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). This theorem relates a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the field over the boundary of that volume.\n\nThe theorem states:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V`. In our case, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n### **3. Set up the Surface Integral**\n\nWe need to evaluate the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   **Field on the Surface (f):** On the surface of the sphere, the radial distance `r` is always equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n\n*   **Differential Surface Vector (dS):** For a sphere, the differential surface area element vector `dS` always points radially outwards. Its magnitude in spherical coordinates is `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. Therefore, the vector is `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Dot Product (f ⋅ dS)**\n\nNow, we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n`f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat]`\n\nSince `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the dot product simplifies beautifully:\n`f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ)`\n`f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nNotice that the dependence on the radius `R` has canceled out. This means the flux is the same for any sphere centered at the origin, regardless of its radius.\n\n### **5. Evaluate the Integral**\n\nNow we integrate `sin(θ) dθ dφ` over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are:\n*   `θ` (polar angle) from 0 to `π`\n*   `φ` (azimuthal angle) from 0 to `2π`\n\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) [∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ] dφ`\n\nLet's evaluate the inner integral first (with respect to `θ`):\n`∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nNow substitute this result into the outer integral (with respect to `φ`):\n`∫(from 0 to 2π) 2 dφ = 2 * [φ]_0^2π = 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π`\n\n### **6.

By converting it to a surface integral on the sphere of radius `R`, we avoid integrating over the singularity itself.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Surface Integral (Flux):**\n    *   The surface integral is `∬_S (f . dS)`.\n    *   On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n    *   The differential surface area element `dS` for a sphere in spherical coordinates points radially outward. Its vector form is `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r̂`.\n    *   Now, we compute the dot product `f . dS`:\n        `f . dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] . [(R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r̂]`\n    *   Since `r̂ . r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies:\n        `f . dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n    *   Now, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for spherical coordinates are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n        `∬_S (f . dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    *   We can separate the integrals:\n        `= [ ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) dφ ] * [ ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ ]`\n    *   Evaluate each integral:\n        *   `∫(from φ=0 to 2π) dφ = [φ]` from 0 to 2π `= 2π - 0 = 2π`\n        *   `∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]` from 0 to π `= -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    *   Multiply the results:\n        `∬_S (f . dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n    *   `∫∫∫_V (∇ . f) dV = 4π`\n\n6.  **Alternative Consideration (Why not zero?):**\n    *   If one were to calculate the divergence `∇ . f` directly for `r > 0`, the result would be zero:\n        `∇ . f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * f_r) = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * (1/r^2)) = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (1) = 0`\n    *   This suggests the integral should be zero. However, this calculation is not valid at `r=0` where the field is infinite. This singularity acts as a point source, and its divergence is not zero but is represented by a Dirac delta function, `∇ . f = 4π * δ³(r)`. The integral of this over a volume containing the origin is `4π`. The Divergence Theorem elegantly handles this singularity by shifting the calculation to the boundary surface.\n\nTherefore, the value of the integral is `4π`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Vector Field:**\n    The problem describes a vector field `f(r)` that points radially outward from the origin and has a magnitude that falls off as `1/r^2`. In spherical coordinates, this vector field can be written as:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n    where `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n2.  **State the Goal:**\n    We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∇ · f`, over the volume `V` of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n    The integral is: `I = ∫∫∫_V (∇ · f) dV`\n\n3.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem):**\n    The Divergence Theorem provides a powerful way to solve this problem.

In spherical coordinates, `∇ · f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r`. Since `f_r = 1/r^2`, we get `∇ · f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`. If we integrate 0 over the volume, we get 0. However, this calculation is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. The vector field `f(r)` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), and its divergence is also undefined there. The Divergence Theorem correctly handles this singularity at the origin.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Surface Integral:**\n    We will now calculate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, which is the flux of the field `f` through the surface of the sphere `S`.\n\n    *   **The field on the surface:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius is constant, `r = R`. So the vector field is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    *   **The differential surface area vector:** For a sphere, the outward-pointing normal vector is always in the radial direction, so `n_hat = r_hat`. The differential surface area vector `dS` is given by `dS = n_hat * dS`, where `dS` is the magnitude of the area element. In spherical coordinates, `dS = R^2 * sin(theta) d(theta) d(phi)`. Therefore, `dS = r_hat * (R^2 * sin(theta) d(theta) d(phi))`.\n    *   **The dot product:** We need to compute `f · dS`:\n        `f · dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] · [ r_hat * (R^2 * sin(theta) d(theta) d(phi)) ]`\n        Since `r_hat · r_hat = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n        `f · dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(theta) d(theta) d(phi)`\n        `f · dS = sin(theta) d(theta) d(phi)`\n        Notice that the `R^2` terms cancel out, meaning the result will be independent of the radius of the sphere.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Integral:**\n    Now we integrate `f · dS` over the entire surface of the sphere.

However, this is a classic scenario (analogous to Gauss's Law for a point charge in electromagnetism) where applying the theorem to the outer boundary gives the correct result for the source contained within. The value of the integral is determined entirely by the singularity at the origin.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Surface Integral (Flux):**\n    We will calculate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, `∮_S (f . dS)`.\n\n    *   **The Surface (S):** The surface is a sphere of radius `R`. On this surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n    *   **The Vector Field on the Surface (f):** On the surface of the sphere, the vector field is:\n        `f(r=R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n    *   **The Differential Surface Element (dS):** For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` points in the direction of the outward normal. The outward normal to a sphere is the radial direction `r̂`. So, the vector surface element is:\n        `dS = dS * r̂`\n        where `dS` is the magnitude of the differential area.\n    *   **The Dot Product (f . dS):** Now we compute the dot product inside the integral:\n        `f . dS = ((1/R^2) * r̂) . (dS * r̂)`\n        Since `r̂ . r̂ = 1`, this simplifies to:\n        `f . dS = (1/R^2) * dS`\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integral:**\n    Now substitute this back into the surface integral:\n    `∮_S (f . dS) = ∮_S (1/R^2) * dS`\n\n    Since `R` is the constant radius of the sphere, `1/R^2` is also a constant and can be taken out of the integral:\n    `= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n\n    The integral `∮_S dS` is simply the total surface area of the sphere `S`. The surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n\n    So, the value of the integral is:\n    `= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n    `= 4π`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this surface integral.\n    `∫_V (∇.f) dV = 4π`\n\n    Therefore, the most appropriate answer is `4π`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 4 π\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 0\n\nThe calculated answer matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\n*   **Vector Field (f):** The problem describes a vector field `f(r)`.\n    *   Its magnitude is `1/r^2`, where `r` is the radial distance from the origin.\n    *   Its direction is purely radial.\n    *   In spherical coordinates, this can be written as the vector `f = (1/r^2) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n*   **Objective:** We need to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of this field. This is written as `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n*   **Volume of Integration (V):** The integration is performed over the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n### 2. Choosing the Method\n\nThere are two primary ways to solve this:\n1.  Directly calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` and then integrate it over the volume. This method can be tricky because the field is singular at the origin `r=0`.\n2.  Use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem), which relates a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the field itself. This method is often much simpler for this type of problem.\n\nWe will use the Divergence Theorem as it is the most efficient method.\n\n### 3. Applying the Divergence Theorem\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ n̂) dS`\n\nWhere:\n*   `V` is the volume (the sphere of radius R).\n*   `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V` (the surface of the sphere of radius R).\n*   `n̂` is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the surface `S`.\n*   `dS` is the differential surface area element.\n\nThe theorem essentially says that the integral of all the \"sources\" (divergence) inside a volume is equal to the total \"flux\" (flow) of the field out of the surface enclosing that volume.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Surface Integral\n\nLet's evaluate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, `∮_S (f ⋅ n̂) dS`.\n\n*   **Vector Field on the Surface (f):** On the surface of the sphere, the radial distance `r` is always equal to the radius `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is `f = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n\n*   **Outward Normal Vector (n̂):** For a sphere centered at the origin, the outward-pointing normal vector at any point on the surface is simply the radial unit vector `r̂`. So, `n̂ = r̂`.\n\n*   **The Dot Product (f ⋅ n̂):** Now we compute the dot product of the field and the normal vector on the surface.\n    `f ⋅ n̂ = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [r̂]`\n    Since `r̂` is a unit vector, `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`.\n    `f ⋅ n̂ = 1/R^2`\n\n*   **The Surface Integral:** Now we substitute this constant value back into the surface integral:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ n̂) dS = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n\n    Since `R` is the constant radius of the sphere, the term `1/R^2` is constant over the entire surface of integration. We can pull it out of the integral:\n    `= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n\n    The integral `∮_S dS` simply means \"sum up all the tiny area elements over the entire surface,\" which is just the total surface area of the sphere. The formula for the surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n\n    So, `∮_S dS = 4πR^2`.\n\n*   **Final Calculation:** Putting it all together:\n    `= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2) = 4π`\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral we wanted to find is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ n̂) dS = 4π`\n\n**Note on the singularity:** The vector field `f = r̂/r^2` is undefined at the origin `r=0`. While this technically violates a condition of the Divergence Theorem, the theorem is routinely and correctly used for such cases in physics (e.g., Gauss's Law for an electric point charge). The physical interpretation is that the singularity at the origin acts as a point source, and the integral of the divergence correctly calculates the total strength of this source, which is `4π`. A more rigorous mathematical proof involves excluding an infinitesimal sphere around the origin and taking a limit, which yields the same result.\n\nThe calculated value is `4π`.

Understanding the Problem\n\n*   **Vector Field (f):** The problem describes a vector field `f`.\n    *   **Magnitude:** `|f| = 1/r^2`, where `r` is the distance from the origin.\n    *   **Direction:** The field points radially outwards from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this direction is represented by the unit vector `r̂`.\n    *   So, we can write the vector field as `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`.\n\n*   **The Integral:** We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field. The expression is `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n*   **The Volume (V):** The integration is performed over the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n### 2. Method 1: Using the Divergence Theorem\n\nThe Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) provides a powerful way to solve this. It states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume `V`.\n\n**Theorem:** `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\n*   **Surface (S):** In this case, the surface `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   **Surface Element (dS):** `dS` is the vector element of surface area. For a sphere, its magnitude is the differential area element `dS`, and its direction is the outward-pointing normal `n`. So, `dS = n dS`.\n\nLet's evaluate the surface integral (the right side of the theorem): `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n1.  **Field on the Surface:** At any point on the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is equal to `R`. So, the vector field `f` on the surface is `f = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n2.  **Surface Normal:** For a sphere centered at the origin, the outward-pointing normal vector `n` at any point on the surface is simply the radial unit vector `r̂`.\n3.  **Vector Surface Element (dS):** `dS = n dS = r̂ dS`.\n4.  **The Dot Product (f ⋅ dS):**\n    `f ⋅ dS = f ⋅ (n dS) = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [r̂ dS]`\n    Since `r̂` is a unit vector, `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`.\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) dS`.\n5.  **The Surface Integral:**\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n    Since `R` is a constant radius for the entire surface, `1/R^2` is a constant and can be taken out of the integral:\n    `= (1/R^2) ∮_S dS`\n    The integral `∮_S dS` is simply the total surface area of the sphere. The formula for the surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n    `= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n    `= 4π`.\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`.\n\n**A Note on the Singularity:** The Divergence Theorem technically requires the vector field to be well-defined and differentiable everywhere inside the volume. The field `f = (1/r^2) * r̂` is singular (undefined) at the origin (`r = 0`), which is inside our sphere. However, the theorem still holds. The singularity at the origin acts as a \"source,\" and the divergence integral precisely calculates the strength of this source. The surface integral correctly measures the total flux flowing out from this source.\n\n### 3. Method 2: Direct Calculation of the Divergence\n\nWe can also try to calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly.\n\n1.  **Divergence Formula in Spherical Coordinates:**\n    `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + ...` (other terms are zero since `f_θ = f_φ = 0`)\n    Our field has `f_r = 1/r^2`.\n2.  **Calculation:**\n    `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r`\n    `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r`\n    `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`\n\nThis calculation shows that the divergence is zero *everywhere except at the origin* (`r > 0`). This seems to imply the integral would be zero. However, this misses the effect of the singularity at `r = 0`. In the theory of distributions, the divergence of this specific field is not zero; it is a Dirac delta function centered at the origin:\n`∇ ⋅ (r̂ / r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`\nwhere `δ³(r)` is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function.\n\n3.  **Integrating the Delta Function:**\n    The volume integral becomes:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV`\n    By the definition of the delta function, integrating it over a volume that contains the origin gives the value of the function multiplying it (in this case, the constant `4π`):\n    `= 4π`.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the result is `4π`.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe volume integral of the divergence of the given field within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin evaluates to `4π`. This value is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere, as long as `R > 0` and the origin is enclosed.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 4π\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe most appropriate answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nThis problem asks for the evaluation of the volume integral of the divergence of a given vector field, `∇.f`, within a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\nThe vector field `f` is given by:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\nwhere `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nThe integral to be evaluated is:\n`I = ∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`\nwhere `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\nThis problem can be elegantly solved using the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem), which states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the outward flux of the vector field through the closed surface `S` that bounds the volume `V`.\n\n`∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, the volume `V` is the sphere of radius `R`, and its bounding surface `S` is the surface of this sphere.\n\nLet's evaluate the surface integral on the right-hand side.\n1.  **Vector Field on the Surface:** On the surface of the sphere, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to the radius `R`. So the vector field on the surface is:\n    `f(r=R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n\n2.  **Differential Surface Area Element:** For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` points radially outward. In spherical coordinates, it is given by:\n    `dS = r̂ * dS = r̂ * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    where `θ` is the polar angle (from 0 to π) and `φ` is the azimuthal angle (from 0 to 2π).\n\n3.  **Dot Product:** Now we compute the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [r̂ * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ]`\n    Since `r̂` is a unit vector, `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`. The `R^2` terms cancel out.\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n4.  **Surface Integral:** Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere by integrating over the full range of `θ` and `φ`.\n    `∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_(φ=0)^(2π) ∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nLet's evaluate the integral. We can separate the variables:\n`∫_(φ=0)^(2π) dφ * ∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ`\n\nThe integral with respect to `θ` is:\n`∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nThe integral with respect to `φ` is:\n`∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n\nMultiplying the results:\n`∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\nTherefore, by the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of the field is `4π`.\n\n`I = ∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\n**Alternative Method (Direct Calculation):**\nThe divergence of the field `f(r) = r̂/r^2` in spherical coordinates is `∇ ⋅ (r̂/r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`, where `δ³(r)` is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function. This signifies that the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, where there is a point source.\nThe integral becomes:\n`I = ∫∫∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV`\nSince the volume of integration (a sphere of radius `R`) includes the origin (where the delta function is non-zero), the integral evaluates to the value of the function multiplying the delta function, which is `4π`.\n`I = 4π`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4 π\nC) 1\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe calculated answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1.

Choose the Right Tool: The Divergence Theorem**\n\nDirectly calculating the divergence of `f` and then integrating over the volume can be tricky because the field `f` is singular at the origin `r=0` (the function `1/r^2` goes to infinity).\n\nA more elegant and powerful method is to use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that bounds the volume.\n\nMathematically:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `dS` is the outward-pointing differential surface area vector.\n\nThe key advantage here is that the surface `S` is at `r=R`, where the field `f` is perfectly well-behaved (it's not singular).\n\n**3. Set up the Surface Integral**\n\nWe need to evaluate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   **Vector field on the surface S:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n*   **Differential surface area vector dS:** For a sphere in spherical coordinates, the differential area element is `dA = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. Since `dS` must be a vector pointing outward from the surface, its direction is the radial direction `r̂`. Therefore, `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Dot Product**\n\nNow we find the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n`f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [(R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂]`\n\nSince `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the expression simplifies significantly:\n`f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2) * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nNotice that the `R^2` terms cancel out. This is a characteristic feature of `1/r^2` fields and indicates that the flux will be independent of the radius `R` of the sphere.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Integral**\n\nNow we integrate `sin(θ) dθ dφ` over the entire surface of the sphere. In spherical coordinates, this means integrating `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) [ ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ ] dφ`\n\nFirst, evaluate the inner integral (with respect to `θ`):\n`∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]` (from `0` to `π`)\n`= -cos(π) - (-cos(0))`\n`= -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nNow, substitute this result into the outer integral (with respect to `φ`):\n`∫(from φ=0 to 2π) 2 dφ = [2φ]` (from `0` to `2π`)\n`= 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral we wanted to find is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = 4π`\n\nThis result has a physical analogy in electrostatics (Gauss's Law).

In vector form, using spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r` is the radial distance and `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nThe volume of integration `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\nThis problem is ideally suited for the application of the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume.\n\nThe theorem is expressed as:\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`\n\nLet's evaluate the right-hand side, which is the surface integral of `f` over the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n1.  **The vector field on the surface:** The surface `S` is the sphere of radius `R`. On this surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n\n2.  **The differential surface element:** For a sphere, the differential surface area element vector `dS` points radially outward, which is the same direction as `r_hat`. So, `dS = dS * r_hat`, where `dS` is the magnitude of the area element.\n\n3.  **The dot product `f . dS`:** Now we compute the dot product to be integrated:\n    `f . dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] . [dS * r_hat]`\n    Since the dot product of a unit vector with itself is 1 (`r_hat . r_hat = 1`), the expression simplifies to:\n    `f . dS = (1/R^2) * dS`\n\n4.  **The surface integral:** Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface `S` of the sphere:\n    `∮_S (f . dS) = ∮_S (1/R^2) * dS`\n    Since `R` is the constant radius of the sphere, `1/R^2` is a constant and can be taken out of the integral:\n    `∮_S (f . dS) = (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n    The integral `∮_S dS` represents the total surface area of the sphere.

In spherical coordinates, `∇ . f` for `r > 0` is `0`. However, the field `f(r) = 1/r^2 * r_hat` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), which is inside our volume of integration. The divergence at the origin is technically a Dirac delta function.

Its magnitude is `|f(r)| = 1/r^2`, and its direction is radial. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n    where `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n    The volume of integration, `V`, is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n2.  **State the problem:**\n    We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field `f(r)`:\n    `∫_V (∇ · f) dV`\n\n3.  **Analyze the divergence of the field:**\n    We can calculate the divergence of `f` using the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates:\n    `∇ · A = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * Ar)/∂r + ...` (other terms involve derivatives with respect to θ and φ)\n    For our field `f`, the only non-zero component is the radial one, `f_r = 1/r^2`.\n    So, `∇ · f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`.\n\n    This calculation is valid for all `r ≠ 0`. However, at the origin (`r = 0`), the field `f(r)` itself is undefined (it has a singularity). The divergence `∇ · f` is not zero at the origin; it is a Dirac delta function. A direct integration of `∇ · f` is non-trivial because of this singularity.\n\n4.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem):**\n    A more powerful way to solve this is to use the Divergence Theorem, which relates a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the vector field's flux. The theorem states:\n    `∫_V (∇ · f) dV = ∮_S (f · dS)`\n    where `S` is the closed surface enclosing the volume `V`. In this case, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n    This theorem is applicable even with a point singularity inside the volume, as it allows us to perform the calculation on the boundary surface where the field is well-behaved.\n\n5.  **Calculate the surface integral (flux):**\n    We need to compute the flux of `f` through the surface `S` of the sphere of radius `R`.\n    -   On the surface `S`, the radial distance is constant: `r = R`. So the field is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    -   The differential surface area element `dS` on a sphere, with the normal pointing outwards, is given by `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ * r_hat`.\n    -   Now, we take the dot product `f · dS`:\n        `f · dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] · [R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ * r_hat]`\n        Since `r_hat · r_hat = 1`, the dot product simplifies to:\n        `f · dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n\n6.  **Evaluate the integral:**\n    Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for spherical coordinates are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n    `∮_S (f · dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    `= (∫_0^{2π} dφ) * (∫_0^{π} sin(θ) dθ)`\n\n    -   The first integral is: `∫_0^{2π} dφ = [φ]_0^{2π} = 2π`.\n    -   The second integral is: `∫_0^{π} sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^{π} = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n    Multiplying the results:\n    `∮_S (f · dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this surface integral.\n    `∫_V (∇ · f) dV = 4π`.\n\n    This result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere, as long as it encloses the origin.

Calculate the Surface Integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`:**\nFirst, we find the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n`f ⋅ dS = ( (1/R^2) * r̂ ) ⋅ ( r̂ * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ )`\nSince `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n`f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * (r̂ ⋅ r̂) * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n`f ⋅ dS = 1 * 1 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n`f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nNow, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for spherical coordinates are:\n*   `θ` (polar angle) from `0` to `π`.\n*   `φ` (azimuthal angle) from `0` to `2π`.\n\nThe integral is:\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫[φ=0 to 2π] ∫[θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nLet's evaluate the integral in parts:\n1.  The integral with respect to `θ`:\n    `∫[from 0 to π] sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_[from 0 to π]`\n    `= (-cos(π)) - (-cos(0))`\n    `= (-(-1)) - (-(1))`\n    `= 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n2.  The integral with respect to `φ`:\n    `∫[from 0 to 2π] dφ = [φ]_[from 0 to 2π]`\n    `= 2π - 0 = 2π`\n\nNow, we multiply the results of the two parts:\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2) * (2π) = 4π`\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere (as long as `R > 0`).

In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\n    where `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`, over the volume `V` of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:**\n    The Divergence Theorem provides a powerful tool to solve this kind of problem. It relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the surface integral of the flux of the field through the closed surface that bounds the volume. The theorem states:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    where `S` is the closed surface enclosing the volume `V`. In our case, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n4.  **Set up the Surface Integral:**\n    We need to evaluate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n    *   **Vector Field on the Surface (f):** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is:\n        `f(r=R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n\n    *   **Differential Surface Area Vector (dS):** For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` always points outward in the radial direction. Its magnitude is `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. So, the vector `dS` is:\n        `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Dot Product (f ⋅ dS):**\n    Now we take the dot product of `f` and `dS` on the surface of the sphere:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r̂ ] ⋅ [ (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂ ]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2) * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Integral:**\n    Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for spherical coordinates are `θ` from 0 to `π` and `φ` from 0 to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_φ=0^(2π) ∫_θ=0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    We can solve this integral in two parts:\n    *   **Inner integral (with respect to θ):**\n        `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    *   **Outer integral (with respect to φ):**\n        `∫_0^(2π) (2) dφ = 2 * [φ]_0^(2π) = 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the value of the original volume integral is equal to the value of this surface integral.\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\n    **Note on the Singularity:** If one were to calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly, one would find it to be zero for all `r ≠ 0`. However, the field is singular at the origin (`r=0`), and the divergence at this point is a Dirac delta function, `∇ ⋅ (r̂/r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`. Integrating `4πδ³(r)` over a volume containing the origin also yields `4π`. The Divergence Theorem conveniently handles this singularity by shifting the calculation to the boundary surface where the field is well-defined.\n\nThe calculated value is `4π`, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nThis problem asks us to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a radially symmetric vector field. The vector field is given by `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, and the volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\nThe integral to be evaluated is `I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\nWe can solve this problem using the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem), which states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the outward flux of the vector field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume. Mathematically:\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, the volume `V` is the sphere of radius `R`, and its enclosing surface `S` is the surface of this sphere.\n\n**Step 1: Define the vector field `f` on the surface `S`**\nOn the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. The vector field `f` on this surface is:\n`f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction, which is also the direction of the outward normal to the sphere.\n\n**Step 2: Define the differential surface area vector `dS`**\nFor a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` is a vector that points in the direction of the outward normal. The outward normal direction is the radial direction, `r_hat`. The magnitude of the area element in spherical coordinates is `R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`.\nTherefore, the vector surface element is:\n`dS = r_hat * (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ)`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the dot product `f ⋅ dS`**\nNow, we compute the dot product of the vector field `f` and the surface element `dS`:\n`f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ r_hat * (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) ]`\nSince `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n`f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n`f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\nNotice that the `R^2` terms have cancelled, indicating that the result will be independent of the radius `R` of the sphere.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the surface integral**\nWe now integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for a full sphere in spherical coordinates are `θ` from 0 to `π` and `φ` from 0 to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nFirst, we integrate with respect to `θ`:\n`∫_{0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_{0}^{π} = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nNext, we integrate the result with respect to `φ`:\n`∫_{0}^{2π} 2 dφ = [2φ]_{0}^{2π} = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, this is the value of the original volume integral.\n\n**Important Note:** One might be tempted to calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly. In spherical coordinates, for a field `f = f_r * r_hat`, the divergence is `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * d/dr(r^2 * f_r)`. For `f_r = 1/r^2`, this gives `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * d/dr(r^2 * 1/r^2) = (1/r^2) * d/dr(1) = 0`. This result is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. At the origin (`r = 0`), the field is singular, and this formula does not apply. The divergence at the origin is a Dirac delta function (`∇ ⋅ (r_hat/r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`). Integrating this over the volume containing the origin gives `4π`. The Divergence Theorem provides a more straightforward way to arrive at this result by avoiding the singularity.\n\nThe final answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** We are asked to compute the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`. The integral is `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n    *   The vector field `f` has a magnitude `|f| = 1/r^2` and points radially outward from the origin. In vector form, this is `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n2.  **Choose the Right Tool:** This problem is a classic application of the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface enclosing the volume. The theorem is stated as:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    where `S` is the closed surface bounding the volume `V`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Surface S and the Field on the Surface:**\n    *   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   The bounding surface `S` is the surface of this sphere.\n    *   The vector field on the surface `S` is found by setting `r = R` in the expression for `f`. So, on the surface, `f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n\n4.  **Define the Differential Surface Element dS:**\n    *   For a sphere, the outward-pointing normal vector is in the radial direction, i.e., `n = r_hat`.\n    *   The differential area element in spherical coordinates is `dA = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n    *   The vector differential surface element `dS` is `dS = n * dA = r_hat * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Dot Product (f ⋅ dS):**\n    *   `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ r_hat * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ ]`\n    *   Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the dot product simplifies to:\n    *   `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Surface Integral:**\n    *   Now we integrate `f ⋅ dS` over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration in spherical coordinates for a full sphere are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    *   `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    *   First, integrate with respect to `θ`:\n        `∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)](from 0 to π) = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    *   Next, integrate the result with respect to `φ`:\n        `∫(from 0 to 2π) 2 dφ = 2 * [φ](from 0 to 2π) = 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   By the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV` is equal to the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n    *   We calculated the surface integral to be `4π`.\n    *   Therefore, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`.\n\n**Alternative Consideration (The Singularity):**\nOne might be tempted to first calculate the divergence of `f`. In spherical coordinates, for `f = f_r(r) * r_hat`, the divergence is `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r`.\nFor `f_r = 1/r^2`, `r^2 * f_r = 1`. The derivative `∂(1)/∂r = 0`. So, `∇ ⋅ f = 0` for any `r ≠ 0`.\nIf we naively integrate `0` over the volume, we get `0`. This is incorrect because it ignores the fact that the field `f` and its divergence are undefined (singular) at the origin `r=0`.\nThe divergence is actually `∇ ⋅ (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ^3(r)`, where `δ^3(r)` is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function. The integral of this over any volume containing the origin is `4π`.\nThe Divergence Theorem elegantly handles this singularity by shifting the calculation to the boundary surface, where the field is well-defined.\n\nComparing our result `4π` with the given options:\nA) 4/3 π R\nB) 0\nC) 4 π\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to compute the volume integral of the divergence of a given vector field `f` over a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin. The integral is `I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n2.  **Define the Vector Field:**\n    *   The problem states the vector field `f` has a magnitude `|f| = 1/r^2`.\n    *   It also states the field has a non-zero component only along the radial direction.\n    *   Therefore, in spherical coordinates, the vector field can be expressed as `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Divergence (`∇ ⋅ f`):**\n    *   We can compute the divergence of `f` using the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates:\n        `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r`\n        where `f_r` is the radial component of `f`.\n    *   Here, `f_r = 1/r^2`.\n    *   Substituting this in, we get:\n        `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`.\n    *   **Crucial Point:** This calculation is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. At the origin (`r = 0`), the field `f` is infinite (1/0), which means it has a singularity. The divergence is undefined at this point using this formula.\n\n4.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:**\n    *   The Divergence Theorem states that `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`, where `S` is the closed surface bounding the volume `V`.\n    *   The theorem has a condition that the vector field `f` must be continuously differentiable throughout the volume `V`. Due to the singularity at `r = 0`, this condition is not met for our volume `V` (the sphere of radius `R`).\n\n5.  **Handle the Singularity:**\n    *   To correctly apply the Divergence Theorem, we can exclude the singularity. We consider the volume `V'` to be the region between our original sphere `S_R` of radius `R` and a very small sphere `S_ε` of radius `ε` around the origin.\n    *   In this new volume `V'`, the field `f` is well-behaved, and we know that `∇ ⋅ f = 0`.\n    *   Therefore, `∫_V' (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∫_V' 0 dV = 0`.\n    *   Applying the Divergence Theorem to `V'`, the total flux out of its boundary must be zero. The boundary of `V'` consists of the outer surface `S_R` and the inner surface `S_ε`.\n        `∮_(S_R ∪ S_ε) (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_S_R (f ⋅ dS) + ∫_S_ε (f ⋅ dS_in) = 0`\n        where `dS_in` is the surface element for `S_ε` pointing into `V'` (i.e., towards the origin). This is `dS_in = -dS`, where `dS` points radially outward.\n    *   So, `∫_S_R (f ⋅ dS) - ∫_S_ε (f ⋅ dS_out) = 0`, which means `∫_S_R (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_S_ε (f ⋅ dS_out)`.\n    *   This shows that the flux through any sphere centered at the origin is the same.\n    *   The original integral `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV` can be understood as the total source/sink strength within the volume. Since the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, the entire contribution must come from the singularity at `r=0`. By the argument above, this is equal to the flux through the bounding surface `S_R`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Surface Integral (Flux):**\n    *   We now calculate the flux through the surface `S` of the sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   The vector field on this surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n    *   The differential surface element in spherical coordinates is `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`.

The limits for `θ` are 0 to `π`, and for `φ` are 0 to `2π`.\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_0^(2π) ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    *   Evaluating the inner integral:\n        `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2`.\n    *   Evaluating the outer integral:\n        `∫_0^(2π) 2 dφ = [2φ]_0^(2π) = 2(2π) - 0 = 4π`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The volume integral of the divergence is equal to the flux through the surface enclosing the volume.\n    *   `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = 4π`.\n    *   (Note: The divergence of this particular field is technically `4π` times the three-dimensional Dirac delta function centered at the origin, `∇ ⋅ (r̂/r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`.

Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given a vector field `f(r)` in three dimensions.\n*   The magnitude of the field is `|f(r)| = 1/r^2`, where `r` is the distance from the origin.\n*   The direction of the field is radial, pointing away from the origin.\n\nIn spherical coordinates `(r, θ, φ)`, this vector field can be written as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nWe need to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of this field (`∇.f`) over the volume `V` of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin. The integral to evaluate is:\n`∫_V (∇.f) dV`\n\n**2. Analyze the Divergence**\n\nWe could try to calculate the divergence `∇.f` directly using the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates:\n`∇.f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * f_r)`\nwhere `f_r` is the radial component of the field. Here, `f_r = 1/r^2`.\n\n`∇.f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * (1/r^2))`\n`∇.f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (1)`\n`∇.f = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`\n\nThis result `∇.f = 0` is valid for any point where `r ≠ 0`. However, at the origin (`r = 0`), the field `f(r) = 1/r^2` is undefined (it goes to infinity). This is a singularity. The direct calculation of the divergence misses the contribution from this single point. Integrating `∇.f = 0` over the volume would incorrectly give an answer of 0.\n\n**3. Apply the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)**\n\nA more powerful method that correctly handles singularities inside the volume is the Divergence Theorem. The theorem states that the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the flux of the vector field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume:\n`∫_V (∇.f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`\n\nHere:\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `dS` is the differential surface area vector, which is `n_hat * dS`, where `n_hat` is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the surface.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Surface Integral**\n\nLet's evaluate the surface integral `∮_S (f . dS)`:\n\n*   The surface `S` is a sphere of radius `R`.\n*   On this surface, the distance from the origin is constant: `r = R`.\n*   The vector field `f` on the surface is: `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   The outward-pointing unit normal vector `n_hat` to the sphere is the same as the radial unit vector `r_hat`. So, `n_hat = r_hat`.\n*   The differential surface vector is `dS = n_hat dS = r_hat dS`.\n\nNow, we can compute the dot product `f . dS`:\n`f . dS = ((1/R^2) * r_hat) . (r_hat dS)`\nSince `r_hat . r_hat = 1`:\n`f . dS = (1/R^2) dS`\n\nNow, substitute this into the surface integral:\n`∮_S (f . dS) = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n\nSince `R` is the constant radius of the sphere, `1/R^2` is a constant and can be taken out of the integral:\n`= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n\nThe integral `∮_S dS` is simply the total surface area of the sphere. The surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n\nSo, the value of the integral is:\n`= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n`= 4π`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe volume integral of the divergence of the field `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat` inside a sphere of radius `R` is `4π`. This result is independent of the radius `R` (as long as `R > 0`).\n\nThis problem is a classic example from vector calculus, closely related to Gauss's Law in electrostatics, where the field `f` represents the electric field of a point charge at the origin.
