A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral carbons). However, a molecule with stereocenters can still be achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion (such molecules are called meso compounds).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   A stereocenter is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon atoms:\n        *   C1 is part of a double bond. Not a stereocenter.\n        *   C2 is part of a double bond. Not a stereocenter.\n        *   C3 (in the ethyl group) is a -CH2- group. Not a stereocenter.\n        *   C4 (in the ethyl group) is a -CH3 group. Not a stereocenter.\n        *   The methyl carbon attached to C2 is also not a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. The molecule is essentially planar about the double bond. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself provides the answer. The prefixes `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers (C-3a and C-7a).\n    *   When a compound is named as a specific, single enantiomer (using R/S notation), it is by definition chiral.\n    *   A pure sample of a single enantiomer will always be optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The configuration is given as (2R, 3S). We need to check for internal symmetry.\n    *   Let's draw a conformation (e.g., a Newman projection looking down the C2-C3 bond or a Fischer projection). In a staggered conformation, if we place the COOH groups anti-periplanar, the H on C2 is opposite the CH3 on C3, and the CH3 on C2 is opposite the H on C3. This conformation has a center of inversion. In an eclipsed conformation, the molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond.\n    *   A compound with stereocenters but which is achiral due to a plane of symmetry or center of inversion is a **meso compound**.\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a classic example of a meso compound.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Its mirror image is (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers are enantiomers. They are diastereomers of the meso (2R,3S) form.\n    *   Since (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it lacks internal symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The name includes the `(R)` designation, which specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   Let's verify the source of chirality. The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the `-CH2-CH=` path around the ring, and (4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` path around the ring. These four groups are different.\n    *   Thus, C1 is a chiral center, and the molecule is chiral. The `(R)` specifies one of the two enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation (related to cis/trans) indicates that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's consider the symmetry of this molecule. Imagine the cyclohexane ring is roughly planar. With all three -OH groups pointing up, the molecule has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) perpendicular to the ring. It also has three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH bond and the C4 atom across the ring.\n    *   The presence of these symmetry elements (especially the planes of symmetry) makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The IUPAC name describes a ketone. The parent chain is butan-1-one, where C1 is the carbonyl carbon. A cyclopentyl group is attached to C1, and a methyl group is at C3.\n    *   The structure is: `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`. This can also be written as `(CH3)2CH-CH2-CO-(Cyclopentyl)`.\n    *   Let's search for chiral centers. A chiral center must have four different substituents.\n    *   The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to one H, two identical -CH3 groups, and a `-CH2-` group. It is not a chiral center.\n    *   No other carbon atom in the molecule is bonded to four different groups. The molecule does not have any stereocenters.\n    *   The molecule is flexible due to single bond rotation and lacks overall chirality. It can easily adopt conformations that possess a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-...dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nCounting the optically active compounds, we have 3.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine if a compound will exhibit optical activity, we need to assess its chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when the molecule lacks any improper axis of rotation, which includes a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   To be chiral, a molecule typically needs a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   In this molecule, there are no chiral centers. C1 is part of a double bond. C2 is part of a double bond. C3 is a CH2 group. C4 is a CH3 group.\n    *   The molecule also lacks other types of chirality like axial or planar chirality.\n    *   It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the double bond).\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name itself specifies the absolute configuration at two stereocenters, `(3aR,7aS)`, and the geometry of a double bond `(E)`.\n    *   When a compound is named as a single, specific stereoisomer with R/S designators, it implies that the molecule is chiral and the name refers to a single enantiomer.\n    *   A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active. This complex bridged system is chiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **chiral** and optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   This specific stereoisomer is `(2R,3S)`. Let's analyze its symmetry.\n    *   Molecules with multiple stereocenters can be achiral if they are meso compounds. A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion in at least one of its conformations, making it superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   For 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, the `(2R,3S)` isomer (which is identical to the `(2S,3R)` isomer) is a classic example of a meso compound. It possesses a center of inversion in its anti-staggered conformation and a plane of symmetry in an eclipsed conformation.\n    *   Since it is a meso compound, it is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` stereoisomer.\n    *   The `(2R,3R)` and `(2S,3S)` forms are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, `(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid` is **chiral** and optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and a hydroxyl group on C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) -CH2-CH=, and (4) =CH-CH2-CH2-. The paths around the ring are different, so C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n    *   Therefore, it is **chiral** and optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This name describes the all-cis isomer of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring's average plane.\n    *   Let's analyze the symmetry of its chair conformations. The all-cis arrangement corresponds to either all three -OH groups being axial (1a, 3a, 5a) or all three being equatorial (1e, 3e, 5e) after a ring flip.\n    *   The tri-equatorial conformer possesses a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry (C3v point group). Each plane passes through one C-H axial bond and the opposite C-OH equatorial group.\n    *   The tri-axial conformer also has a C3 axis and three planes of symmetry.\n    *   Since the molecule possesses planes of symmetry in its stable conformations, it is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We check for any chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain, `CH(CH3)2`, is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. No other carbon in the chain or the ring is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters and is flexible enough to adopt conformations with a plane of symmetry (e.g., the plane containing the C=O group).\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn optically active compound is a chiral molecule that can rotate the plane of polarized light. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let's analyze each compound to determine its chirality and thus its potential for optical activity.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   To be chiral, a molecule must lack an internal plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   This molecule has a double bond. The atoms connected to the double bond (Cl, H, C(CH3), C(CH2CH3)) lie in the same plane.\n    *   This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name of this compound includes stereochemical descriptors for absolute configuration: `(3aR, 7aS)`.\n    *   The designation of R and S configurations specifies a particular stereoisomer. When a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule is named, it is by definition chiral.\n    *   A sample consisting of a single enantiomer is optically active.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 (H, CH3, COOH, -CH(CH3)COOH) are identical to the substituents on C3.\n    *   The configuration is given as (2R, 3S), meaning the two stereocenters have opposite configurations.\n    *   A compound with multiple stereocenters that is achiral is called a meso compound. This typically occurs when the stereocenters have opposite configurations (one R, one S) and have identical sets of substituents.\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has a center of inversion and is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The configuration is (2R, 3R), meaning both stereocenters have the same configuration.\n    *   This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral.\n    *   Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) isomer, which is non-superimposable. These two form a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The name specifies the absolute configuration `(R)` at one of the carbons (C1).\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and the `-CH=CH-CH2-` part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule is chiral. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   This molecule is conformationally flexible. Its most stable conformations are two interconverting chairs. Both of these chair conformations are chiral (they belong to the C3 point group).\n    *   However, a molecule is considered achiral if it can easily access any achiral conformation. The process of ring-flipping in cyclohexane passes through higher-energy boat and twist-boat conformations. For the all-cis-1,3,5-triol, there exists an accessible boat conformation that possesses a plane of symmetry (a C_s point group).\n    *   Because the molecule can readily pass through an achiral conformation, the chiral conformers rapidly interconvert, resulting in a racemic mixture that cannot be resolved. Thus, the compound as a whole is considered achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to a carbonyl, which is then attached to an isobutyl group: `(C5H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for stereocenters. There are none. All carbons are bonded to at least two identical groups (e.g., two H's on a CH2, or two CH3's on the CH).\n    *   The molecule is flexible due to single bond rotation. It is possible to find a conformation that has a plane of symmetry. This plane would contain the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisect both the cyclopentyl ring and the isobutyl group.\n    *   Since the molecule has no stereocenters and has accessible conformations with a plane of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and present in a non-racemic form. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. However, a molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it is a meso compound (possessing an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms bonded to the sp2 carbons (Cl, H, C, C) lie in the same plane. The molecule is planar.\n    *   Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself provides the key information. The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` indicate the presence of specific stereocenters with a defined absolute configuration. The `(E)` describes the geometry of the exocyclic double bond.\n    *   This designates a single, specific stereoisomer. A specific stereoisomer is always optically active unless it happens to be a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound must possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The structure is complex and unsymmetrical, particularly due to the `(E)-chloromethylene` group (`=CHCl`). This substituent breaks any potential symmetry that the parent bicyclic framework might have.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is chiral and, as a specific stereoisomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are identical to the substituents on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group).\n    *   For a molecule with two identical stereocenters, the isomer with the (R,S) or (S,R) configuration is the meso form.\n    *   The meso form has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond. Because it is superimposable on its mirror image, it is achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. It is the (R,R) diastereomer.\n    *   This isomer does not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, and they are not superimposable.\n    *   The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers form an enantiomeric pair. As a single enantiomer is specified, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   This is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and an alcohol group (at C1).\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) -CH2-CH=CH- (path towards C2), and (4) -CH2-CH2-CH= (path towards C6). The two paths around the ring are different due to the asymmetric position of the double bond relative to C1.\n    *   Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter. The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Thus, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This name describes the isomer where the three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's consider the chair conformation. The most stable conformation would have all three bulky -OH groups in equatorial positions. However, even the less stable tri-axial conformation can be considered.\n    *   In the tri-axial conformation, the molecule possesses a C3 axis of rotation and, more importantly, three vertical planes of symmetry (σv). Each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the CH2 group opposite to it.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Although the molecule has conformational isomers, the overall time-averaged molecule is achiral because the symmetric conformers are accessible.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We need to check for any stereocenters (a carbon with four different substituents).\n    *   The `CH(CH3)2` carbon is bonded to H, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the molecule; it is not a stereocenter.\n    *   All other carbons are either sp2 hybridized (C=O) or are CH2 groups, so there are no stereocenters in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule also possesses a plane of symmetry in its most stable conformation (this plane contains the carbonyl group and bisects the cyclopentyl ring and the isobutyl group).\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, it is **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   **Active**: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   **Active**: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Active**: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   **Inactive**: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n*   **Inactive**: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Inactive**: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n*   **Inactive**: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and present in a form that is not a racemic mixture.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** ClHC=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1 and C2) and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. The entire molecule is essentially planar. A molecule with a plane of symmetry (in this case, the molecular plane itself) is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides crucial information.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereochemical descriptors (3a**R**, 7a**S**, **E**) specify a single, unique stereoisomer. The presence of R/S descriptors indicates that there are chiral centers in the molecule. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active. This molecule is highly asymmetric and is not a meso compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. However, the molecule has a symmetric structure (the two ends are identical -COOH groups). The (2R, 3S) configuration results in a meso compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This is typically due to the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of any internal elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`. The molecule contains a double bond. All atoms connected to the double bond (Cl, H, C of CH3, C of CH2CH3) lie in the same plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors (R, S, E). The \"(3aR,7aS)\" part indicates that there are chiral centers at positions 3a and 7a, and a specific spatial arrangement is defined. A compound for which a specific enantiomer (like R or S) is named is, by definition, chiral and optically active (unless it's a meso compound, which is not the case for this complex structure).\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. The descriptors are (2R, 3S). Let's examine its structure. This specific combination of R and S configurations results in a molecule with a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond. Such a compound, which has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to internal symmetry, is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are optically inactive.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The stereochemistry is (2R, 3R). This molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral, and its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) enantiomer. As a chiral molecule, it is optically active.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. The carbon atom C1, bonded to the -OH group, is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH=CH- (part of the ring), and -CH2-CH2- (the other part of the ring). The name specifies the (R) enantiomer. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The 's' notation, in this context, usually implies a 'cis' relationship between the substituents. So, this is the all-cis isomer, with all three hydroxyl groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. If you consider the more stable chair conformation where all three -OH groups are equatorial, the molecule has three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl ring)`. We need to check for any chiral centers.\n    *   Carbonyl carbon: bonded to three things (O, cyclopentyl, -CH2-). Not chiral.\n    *   -CH2- group: bonded to two identical H atoms. Not chiral.\n    *   -CH(CH3)2 group: The central carbon is bonded to H and two identical -CH3 groups. Not chiral.\n    *   Cyclopentyl ring: All carbons are -CH2- groups (symmetrically substituted). No chiral centers.\n    Since the molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality), it is achiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe optically active compounds are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine how many of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to assess each molecule for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral and is not present as a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers (a racemic mixture). The naming conventions used will help us determine this. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of stereocenters and the absence of any plane of symmetry (σ) or center of inversion (i).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule contains a double bond. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane.\n    *   This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex molecule.

It is not a meso compound.\n    *   Since the name specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it will be **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   The groups on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH).\n    *   The stereochemical descriptors are opposite: `(2R,3S)`.\n    *   A molecule with multiple chiral centers and identical substituents that has an R,S configuration (or S,R) is a **meso compound**. Meso compounds have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making them achiral despite the presence of chiral centers.\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has a center of inversion and is achiral. Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound.\n    *   The stereochemical descriptors are the same: `(2R,3R)`.\n    *   This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is chiral.\n    *   Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer.\n    *   The name specifies a single enantiomer, so it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   This molecule has a chiral center at C1, which is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and the `-CH2-CH2-` part of the ring.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This name describes a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups. The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` is non-standard. However, it likely refers to the relative stereochemistry. A similar standard notation is `(1r, 3c, 5c)`, where 'r' is a reference, and 'c' means cis. A notation like `(1s,3s,5s)` strongly suggests that all substituents have the same spatial relationship, meaning they are all `cis` to each other (all on the same side of the ring).\n    *   The `cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol` isomer is a highly symmetrical molecule. It has a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and three planes of symmetry (σv).\n    *   Due to these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We examine the molecule for chiral centers. There are none.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized.\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring has planes of symmetry.\n        *   The 3-methylbutyl group has a carbon (C3) bonded to a hydrogen, a CH2 group, and two identical methyl groups, so it's not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule as a whole possesses a plane of symmetry in certain conformations.

The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters, but this is not a guarantee, as molecules with multiple stereocenters can be achiral if they possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion (these are called meso compounds). A compound named with a specific stereochemical descriptor like (R) or (S) is a single enantiomer and is therefore optically active, unless it is a meso compound.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `CH3CH2(CH3)C=CHCl`.\n    *   This molecule contains a C=C double bond, but no chiral centers (a chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane containing the atoms of the double bond).\n    *   Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex, polycyclic molecule.\n    *   The name itself provides the crucial information. It specifies the absolute configuration at two stereocenters, C-3a as (R) and C-7a as (S), and the geometry of a double bond as (E).\n    *   Naming a specific stereoisomer with (R) and (S) designations implies that the molecule is chiral and that this is one of its enantiomers. It is highly unlikely that a molecule with such a complex and asymmetric structure would be meso.\n    *   Therefore, it is a single enantiomer and is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.

A compound is optically active if and only if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. We will analyze each compound for elements of chirality.\n\n### Analysis of Each Compound\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, the carbon of the methyl group, the first carbon of the ethyl group) all lie in the same plane. Essentially, the entire molecule is planar. A planar molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The core is a norbornane-like system.\n    *   **Analysis:** The IUPAC name itself provides the crucial information. The prefixes `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers (the bridgehead carbons 3a and 7a). The designation of a specific enantiomer with (R) and (S) configurations implies that the molecule is chiral. If it were an achiral meso compound, it would not be named as a single (R,S) enantiomer in this manner. The molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. The configuration is given as (2R, 3S), meaning the two stereocenters have opposite configurations. In molecules with two stereocenters and identical substituents on both centers (like this one), the (R,S) isomer is a meso compound. A meso compound has a center of symmetry or a plane of symmetry in at least one of its conformations. For (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, the staggered conformation possesses a center of inversion, and the eclipsed conformation has a plane of symmetry. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the compound above. It has two stereocenters with the same configuration, (2R, 3R). This molecule does not have any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which is the (2S, 3S) isomer. Therefore, it is a chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to check for chiral centers. Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -H, (2) -OH, (3) -CH2-CH= (path towards C2), and (4) -CH2-CH2-CH= (path towards C6). Since the two paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. The name also specifies the (R) configuration, indicating it is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor `(1s,3s,5s)` implies that the three substituents are on the same side of the ring (all *cis*).\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's consider the chair conformation. In the all-*cis* isomer, the three -OH groups can be either all axial or all equatorial. In both cases, the molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite C-H bond on the ring. The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral, even though carbons C1, C3, and C5 are stereocenters. This is a meso compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2`\n    *   **Analysis:** We must check for any chiral centers. The cyclopentyl ring has only -CH2- groups. The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized. The chain is an isobutyl group attached to a methylene: -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2. The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH2- group, and two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The molecule also lacks any other element of chirality like axial or planar chirality. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n### Summary\n\nLet's tally the results:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine if a compound exhibits optical activity, we need to assess whether it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually means the molecule lacks any improper axis of rotation, which includes a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H on C1; C(methyl), C(ethyl) on C2) lie in the same plane. The molecule has a plane of symmetry which is the plane of the molecule itself. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral, optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The core `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione` is a saturated derivative related to the Diels-Alder adduct of furan and maleic anhydride. This parent core structure is a meso compound; it has stereocenters (3a and 7a) but possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereocenters are designated (3aR, 7aS), which is characteristic of a meso compound. However, there is a substituent on the methano bridge (C8): `8-(chloromethylene)`, which is an =CHCl group. The plane of symmetry in the parent molecule passes through this C8 bridge atom. The substituent =CHCl is not symmetric (H ≠ Cl). Therefore, the introduction of this group destroys the plane of symmetry of the parent molecule. The resulting molecule is chiral. The name `(3aR,7aS,E)-...` specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral compound. Single enantiomers are optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral, optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH₃, COOH, and the other -CH(CH₃)COOH group). When the two stereocenters in such a molecule have opposite configurations (one R, one S), the compound is a meso form. A meso compound has a plane of symmetry (in its eclipsed conformation) or a center of inversion (in its staggered conformation). Due to this internal symmetry, it is achiral despite having stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral (meso), optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The stereocenters have the same configuration (both R). This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It has a non-superimposable mirror image, which is the (2S,3S) isomer. These two form a pair of enantiomers. As a single enantiomer, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral, optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group on C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name specifies the (R) configuration, which indicates we are dealing with a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The carbon atom C1 is a stereocenter because the four groups attached to it are different: -OH, -H, the path -CH₂-CH=CH- (from C2 to C3), and the path -CH₂-CH₂-CH= (from C6 to C5). The molecule lacks any element of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral, optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with -OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation implies that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's visualize the molecule with all three -OH groups pointing \"up\". This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a three-fold axis of rotation (C₃) perpendicular to the ring. More importantly, it has three vertical planes of symmetry (σᵥ). Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the opposite C-H bond. The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral, optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to look for any source of chirality. There are no stereocenters in the molecule. The carbon in the CH(CH₃)₂ group is bonded to two identical methyl groups. All other sp³ carbons are CH₂ groups or part of the symmetric cyclopentyl ring system connected to the carbonyl. The molecule is flexible due to rotation around single bonds, and it can adopt conformations that have a plane of symmetry. For instance, a plane can contain the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisect both the cyclopentyl ring and the isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]. Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral, optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Optically active (chiral) compounds:\n    - (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    - (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    - (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n- Optically inactive (achiral) compounds:\n    - (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    - (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    - (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    - 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nA molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key feature to look for is the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C of methyl, C of ethyl) lie in the same plane.\n    *   This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   Since it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)`. This specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer.\n    *   A specific stereoisomer is, by definition, a pure enantiomer or a diastereomer.\n    *   Unless the molecule is a meso compound (having chiral centers but being achiral overall due to internal symmetry), a single stereoisomer is chiral and optically active.\n    *   The complex, multi-ring structure with an `(E)-chloromethylene` (`=CHCl`) substituent makes it highly unlikely for the molecule to possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The `R` and `S` designations at the chiral centers (3a and 7a) confirm the presence of chirality. The specific configuration `(3aR,7aS)` combined with the `(E)` double bond represents a single chiral molecule.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   Let's examine the symmetry of the `(2R,3S)` stereoisomer. This particular combination of stereocenters creates a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound has chiral centers, but it is achiral overall because it possesses an internal element of symmetry.\n    *   In the case of (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, there is a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C2-C3 bond.\n    *   Due to this center of inversion, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. The stereochemistry is `(2R,3R)`.\n    *   This molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` stereoisomer, and they are non-superimposable. They form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Since `(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid` is a chiral molecule, a pure sample of it will be optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group.\n    *   The carbon atom C1, bonded to the -OH group, is a chiral center. It is attached to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH2-CH= (C2), and -CH=CH-CH2- (C6).\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptors `(1s,3s,5s)` indicate that all three -OH groups have the same relative stereochemistry (they are all on the same side of the ring, e.g., all *cis*).\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   Let's check for any chiral centers (a carbon atom with four different substituents).\n    *   The carbon in the `(CH3)2CH-` group is bonded to one H, two identical methyl (-CH3) groups, and a `-CH2-` group. It is not a chiral center.\n    *   No other carbon atom in the molecule has four different substituents. The cyclopentyl ring is also symmetrically substituted.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is optically inactive.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to assess whether each molecule is chiral and not a meso compound.

The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers (the bridgehead carbons).\n    *   Naming a compound with specific R/S descriptors means that we are referring to a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   Unless this specific stereoisomer happens to be a meso compound (which is not the case here, as the `(R,S)` combination in this specific ring system does not lead to a plane or center of symmetry), it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   A pure sample of a single enantiomer is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The stereoisomer is specified as `(2R,3S)`. When a molecule has two chiral centers with opposite configurations (R,S) and the groups attached to these centers are the same (here, both centers are attached to H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group), we must check if it is a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound is an achiral compound that has chiral centers. It possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, which makes it superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   The (2R,3S) isomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a classic example of a meso compound. It has a center of symmetry when in the anti-periplanar conformation.\n    *   Since it is a meso compound, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The configuration is `(2R,3R)`. This isomer does not have any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable (they are enantiomers).\n    *   The name refers to a single enantiomer, which is chiral. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an OH group at C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, the ring segment -CH2-CH=, and the ring segment -CH2-CH2-CH=. These two paths around the ring are different, so C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   As a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` is unusual, but in this context, it implies a symmetrical arrangement where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's visualize the molecule with all three OH groups pointing \"up\" from the average plane of the ring. This molecule has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and, more importantly, three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the C-H group on the opposite side of the ring (e.g., C1 and C4).\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The name describes a ketone where the carbonyl group is bonded to a cyclopentyl group and a 3-methylbutyl (isobutyl) group.\n    *   Structure: `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-(C5H9)` where C5H9 is a cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   Let's search for chiral centers. The carbon atom in the `CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. There are no other potential chiral centers in the chain or in the unsubstituted cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the `C=O`, `CH2`, and `CH` groups and bisects the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   Due to this plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. The presence of specific stereochemical descriptors like (R) or (S) indicates a specific enantiomer, which is optically active unless the molecule is an achiral meso compound.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure**: The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. C1 is bonded to H and Cl. C2 is bonded to a methyl group (-CH3) and an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The molecule is planar about the double bond. There are no chiral centers (carbon atoms with four different substituents). The plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The important part of the name for determining optical activity is `(3aR,7aS)`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: These descriptors indicate the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3a and 7a). The naming of a molecule as a single, specific enantiomer (by using R/S notation) implies that the molecule is chiral. While some molecules with multiple stereocenters can be achiral (meso compounds), the complex and asymmetric nature of this substituted methanoisobenzofuran derivative (especially with the substituent at position 8) makes it highly unlikely to have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure**: This is succinic acid with methyl groups on C2 and C3. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The molecule has two identical ends (COOH) and two stereocenters with opposite configurations (2R, 3S). This is a classic example of a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry, despite having stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure**: Same base structure as the previous compound, but with different stereochemistry.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The two stereocenters have the same configuration (2R, 3R). This molecule is chiral and does not have an internal plane of symmetry. Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) compound, and they are non-superimposable. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure**: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and a hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The name specifies the (R) configuration at C1. Let's verify C1 is a stereocenter. It is bonded to four different groups: (1) -H, (2) -OH, (3) the `-CH2-CH=CH-` part of the ring, and (4) the `-CH2-CH2-` part of the ring. Since the paths around the ring from C1 are different, the four groups are different. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter. The molecule as a whole lacks any symmetry elements that would make it achiral. The name designates a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure**: A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` is an older nomenclature indicating that all substituents have the same relative configuration (all cis).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: In the all-cis isomer, all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring. In a chair conformation, this means they are either all axial or all equatorial. This highly symmetric arrangement results in the molecule having multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through the C1-O bond and the C4 atom bisects the ring, with C2 reflecting onto C6 and C3 reflecting onto C5. Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a ketone with a cyclopentyl group on one side of the carbonyl and a 3-methylbutyl (isopentyl) group on the other. The structure is `Cyclopentyl-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: We need to check for any stereocenters.\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring consists of only -CH2- groups.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized.\n        *   In the 3-methylbutyl group, the carbon at position 3, `-CH(CH3)2`, is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the chain. Since it's bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter.\n        *   The molecule has no stereocenters and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   **Active**: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.\n*   **Inactive**: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.\n\nThere are **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers), but the molecule as a whole must lack any improper axis of rotation (S_n), which includes planes of symmetry (S_1) and centers of inversion (S_2).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   A stereocenter is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

A single enantiomer is by definition chiral and optically active. Its mirror image would be the (3aS, 7aR)... compound, which would be a non-superimposable molecule.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers, C2 and C3.\n    *   When a molecule has multiple stereocenters, we must check for internal symmetry. The (2R, 3S) configuration creates a molecule with a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry in certain conformations.\n    *   Let's draw a Fischer projection for the (2R,3S) isomer:\n        ```\n              COOH\n               |\n        CH3 -- C -- H   (2R)\n               |\n          H -- C -- CH3   (3S)\n               |\n              COOH\n        ```\n    *   A horizontal line drawn between C2 and C3 represents a plane of symmetry.

The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -H, (2) -OH, (3) the ring segment `-CH2-CH=CH-`, and (4) the ring segment `-CH2-CH2-CH=`. Because the path around the ring from C1 in each direction is different due to the position of the double bond, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, it is **chiral** and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is the isomer of cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (cis).\n    *   This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (σ_v). Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite C-H bond.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral** and thus **optically inactive**. Although C1, C3, and C5 are stereogenic carbons, the overall molecule is achiral (meso-like).\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's search for chiral centers.\n        *   The `CH(CH3)2` carbon is bonded to a hydrogen and two identical methyl groups, so it's not chiral.\n        *   All other carbons in the butanoyl chain are either sp2 hybridized (`C=O`) or part of a `CH2` group, so they are not chiral.\n        *   In the cyclopentyl ring, all carbons are `CH2` groups except for the one attached to the carbonyl. This carbon is attached to -H, the carbonyl group, and two `-CH2-` groups within the ring. The path around the ring in both directions is identical (`-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-`). Thus, this carbon is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and is **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary**:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive (achiral)\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it will exhibit optical activity. A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and is present as a single enantiomer or in an enantiomerically enriched form. The naming conventions used in the question imply we are considering single, specific stereoisomers. Therefore, the question is equivalent to identifying which of the listed compounds are chiral.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule has a double bond between C1 and C2. The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** To be chiral, a molecule must not be superimposable on its mirror image. This usually requires a chiral center or another element of chirality (axial, planar, helical).\n    *   This molecule has no chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups). The atoms around the C=C double bond lie in a plane. The molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane containing the double bond and the atoms directly attached to it). Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex name for a bicyclic compound. The core `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione` is a derivative of norbornane, specifically the saturated version of the Diels-Alder adduct between cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride. The parent molecule without the substituent is a meso compound (achiral) and has a plane of symmetry. The stereodescriptors `(3aR,7aS)` are consistent with a meso compound.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The substituent is `(E)-8-(chloromethylene)`, which means a `=C(H)Cl` group is attached to the C8 bridge carbon. This substituent lies on the plane of symmetry of the parent molecule. However, the substituent itself (`=C(H)Cl`) is not symmetric with respect to this plane. The presence of this substituent therefore destroys the plane of symmetry of the entire molecule. The desymmetrization of a meso compound results in a chiral molecule. Since the name specifies a single stereoisomer `(3aR,7aS,E)`, we are dealing with a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. (Note: While the chemical stability of this structure is questionable due to a double bond involving a bridge atom in a [2.2.1] system, we evaluate its chirality based on the provided name).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The stereoisomer is specified as `(2R,3S)`. When drawn, for example in a Fischer projection, this molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3. This makes it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral due to internal compensation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This is a diastereomer of the previous compound.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The `(2R,3R)` stereoisomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` enantiomer. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the ring segment `-CH2-C3=`, and (4) the ring segment `-C6H2-C5=`. These four groups are different, so C1 is a chiral center. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` designation indicates that all three OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This molecule, whether in its all-axial or all-equatorial chair conformation, possesses elements of symmetry. Specifically, it has three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite C-H group across the ring. The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral, even though it contains stereogenic centers (it is a meso compound).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The name describes a ketone. The parent chain is `butan-1-one`, which is a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. A cyclopentyl group is also on C1, and a methyl group is on C3. The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`. This can also be seen as isopentyl cyclopentyl ketone, or more systematically, `1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's look for chiral centers. The only potential chiral center is C3 of the butane chain. The groups attached to C3 are: H, -CH3 (C4), -CH3 (the substituent), and `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. Since C3 is attached to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no other elements of chirality. It is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nCounting the optically active compounds, we find there are 3.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nA molecule is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture (an equal mixture of both enantiomers). A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. However, a molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion (these are called meso compounds).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond. The atoms connected to the double bond (Cl, H, C, CH3, C of ethyl) lie in the same plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex molecule with multiple stereocenters.\n    *   The name explicitly gives the absolute configuration for several of these centers (`3aR`, `7aS`) and for a double bond (`E`).\n    *   When a specific enantiomer or diastereomer is indicated by R/S notations, it implies the molecule is a single stereoisomer.\n    *   A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active. While it is possible for a compound with R and S descriptors to be a meso compound (achiral), the complex and asymmetric nature of this bicyclic system, along with the non-equivalent stereocenters (3a and 7a), makes it virtually certain to be chiral. The naming convention confirms we are dealing with a specific, resolved stereoisomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (-H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other chiral group). This means a meso form is possible.\n    *   The meso form is the one with opposite configurations at the two equivalent stereocenters, i.e., (R,S) or (S,R).\n    *   Let's check for symmetry. The (2R,3S) isomer has a center of inversion when in the anti-periplanar conformation. A center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   This is a classic example of a meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound described above.\n    *   The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers form a pair of enantiomers. They are chiral and non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n    *   Since the compound is specified as a single enantiomer (2R,3R), it will rotate plane-polarized light.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (C3=C4) and an alcohol group (at C1).\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and the `-CH=CH-CH2-` part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral. The name specifies the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `s` notation (or assuming it means S for `sinister` or `syn`) indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   This all-cis isomer is highly symmetrical. Whether the OH groups are all axial or all equatorial (in the chair conformations), the molecule possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (σv).\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We need to check for any stereocenters. A stereocenter is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   There are no such carbon atoms in this molecule. The `CH` in the `CH(CH3)2` (isopropyl) group is attached to two identical methyl groups. All carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are CH2 groups.\n    *   The molecule lacks any chiral centers or other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). It has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe have identified three optically active compounds from the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nSo, the total number of optically active compounds is 3.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral. Generally, this means it should not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule has a double bond between C1 and C2. The structure is `ClCH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral. It does not have any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)`. The `R` and `S` designations specify the absolute configuration at chiral centers 3a and 7a. The `E` specifies the geometry at the double bond of the chloromethylene group. The naming of a specific enantiomer (using R/S) implies that the molecule is chiral and that this is one of its non-superimposable mirror images. A single enantiomer is always optically active. The structure is complex and lacks any obvious symmetry elements.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** Succinic acid is a four-carbon dicarboxylic acid. 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has the structure `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. There are two chiral centers, at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This molecule has two chiral centers with the same set of four substituents (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). This arrangement allows for the existence of a meso compound. The `(2R,3S)` stereoisomer is this meso compound. It possesses a center of inversion, which makes it superimposable on its mirror image. A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a diastereomer of the compound above, with the structure `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The `(2R,3R)` configuration does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` compound. A pure sample of the `(2R,3R)` enantiomer will rotate plane-polarized light.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine C1. It is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring (C2-C3 path), and 4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring (C6-C5-C4 path). Since the two paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule does not have any plane of symmetry. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single, pure enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `1s,3s,5s` designation (related to cis/trans) indicates that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's visualize the molecule. With all three -OH groups pointing 'up', the molecule has three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one of the C-OH groups and the CH2 group directly opposite it in the ring. For example, the plane containing C1 and C4 bisects the molecule into two identical halves (C2 reflects onto C6, and C3 reflects onto C5). Since the molecule has planes of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The IUPAC name is slightly unconventional, but the most plausible structure is a ketone where the carbonyl group is bonded to a cyclopentyl ring and an isobutyl group (`-CH2-CH(CH3)2`). The structure is `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's search for chiral centers. The carbon atoms in the isobutyl group are not chiral (C3 of the butanoyl chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups). The carbon in the cyclopentyl ring attached to the carbonyl is bonded to two identical `-CH2-` groups within the ring. There are no chiral centers. The molecule as a whole can adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry. This plane would bisect the cyclopentyl ring and the isobutyl group. Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: **Inactive**\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Inactive** (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: **Inactive** (achiral)\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: **Inactive** (achiral)\n\nCounting the number of optically active compounds, we find there are 3.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\nThe user wants to determine how many of the seven given compounds will exhibit optical activity. A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature leading to chirality is a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). However, a molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion; such compounds are called meso compounds. Conversely, some molecules without stereocenters can be chiral (e.g., allenes, atropisomers), but this is less common.\n\nWe will analyze each compound individually to determine its chirality.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The molecule is essentially planar. The plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex, polycyclic molecule with a rigid framework.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. These `R` and `S` descriptors are used to define the absolute configuration at specific stereocenters. The presence of these descriptors in the name indicates that the molecule is chiral and that a specific, single enantiomer is being described. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3). The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). When a molecule has two identical stereocenters, the diastereomer with opposite configurations (`R,S` or `S,R`) is a meso compound. Meso compounds possess an internal plane of symmetry (in at least one conformation) or a center of inversion, making them achiral and optically inactive despite having stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Inactive (meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound described above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` compound, and they are a pair of enantiomers. Since this compound is chiral, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring containing a C=C double bond and an alcohol group.\n    *   **Analysis:** Carbon C1, bonded to the -OH group, is a stereocenter. The four groups attached to it are: -H, -OH, the path around the ring towards the double bond (-CH2-CH=), and the path around the ring away from the double bond (-CH2-CH2-CH=). These two paths are different. The molecule as a whole lacks any element of symmetry. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all on the same side of the ring (all `cis`).\n    *   **Analysis:** Although carbons C1, C3, and C5 are stereocenters, the molecule as a whole is highly symmetrical. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH bond and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring. The presence of these planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The most plausible structure based on IUPAC nomenclature is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. The parent chain is a butan-1-one, with the carbonyl as C1. A methyl group is on C3. A cyclopentyl group is on C1. This gives `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`. Rechecking the numbering `C1(=O)-C2H2-C3H(CH3)-C4H3`. Yes, this is `3-methyl-butan-1-one`. The full name is `1-cyclopentyl-3-methyl-1-butanone`. The group is isobutyl, `(CH3)2CH-CH2-`. Let's build from the name again. `3-methylbutanoyl` is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-`. The ketone is cyclopentyl 3-methylbutanoyl ketone. So the structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's examine this structure for stereocenters.\n        *   The C3 of the chain is bonded to one H and two identical `CH3` groups, so it is not a stereocenter.\n        *   There are no other stereocenters in the chain or the cyclopentyl ring.\n        *   The molecule has no other sources of chirality like chiral axes or planes. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity, we have 3.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the optical activity of each compound. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters without any internal elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** ClHC=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃). This is an alkene.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar about the C=C double bond. This plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. There are no stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The name specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer with the configurations (3aR, 7aS) at two stereocenters and (E) at a double bond. When a specific enantiomer (indicated by R/S descriptors) is named, it implies the compound is chiral and has been resolved from its mirror image. Such a complex structure is highly unlikely to possess the symmetry required to be a meso compound. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is symmetric, as the groups attached to C2 are identical to the groups attached to C3 (H, CH₃, COOH). We need to check if the (2R,3S) configuration leads to a meso compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry. For a molecule with two equivalent stereocenters, the (R,S) isomer is a meso compound. This molecule has a center of inversion midway along the C2-C3 bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a meso compound. Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. This is a diastereomer of the previous compound.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Both stereocenters have the same configuration (R,R). This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is chiral, and its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring containing a double bond (between C3 and C4) and an alcohol group (at C1).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the -CH=CH-CH₂- path around the ring, and (4) the -CH₂-CH₂-CH= path around the ring. These two paths are different, so C1 is a stereocenter. The molecule as a whole lacks any element of symmetry. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The nomenclature `1s,3s,5s` indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all `cis`).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This is a highly symmetric molecule. Although C1, C3, and C5 are stereocenters, the molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through the C1-OH bond and the C4 atom acts as a mirror plane, reflecting C2 onto C6 and C3 onto C5. Since C3 and C5 have identical substituents in the same orientation, the molecule is symmetrical with respect to this plane. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-(Cyclopentyl).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We need to check for any stereocenters or overall molecular chirality. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The isobutyl group `((CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-)` is not chiral. The cyclopentyl ring attached to the carbonyl group is also not chiral, as the two paths around the ring from the point of attachment are identical. The molecule as a whole possesses a plane of symmetry that includes the carbonyl group and bisects both the isobutyl group and the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n*   **Active**: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   Inactive: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Active**: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Active**: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Inactive: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n*   Inactive: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nCounting the optically active compounds, we find there are 3.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity. A compound exhibits optical activity if and only if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (a carbon atom with four different substituents), but the ultimate test is the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion in the molecule.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule is an alkene. The atoms involved in the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane.

These are Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (R/S) notations that describe the absolute configuration at two specific chiral centers (carbons 3a and 7a). The fact that a specific enantiomer is named indicates that the molecule is chiral. A single, specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active. This compound is not a meso compound because it lacks the necessary internal symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The two chiral centers are identically substituted (both are bonded to H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). For such molecules, three stereoisomers exist: a pair of enantiomers (R,R and S,S) and a meso form (R,S). The (R,S) stereoisomer has a plane of symmetry between the two carbon atoms. A compound with chiral centers but an internal plane of symmetry is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a meso compound, which is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a different stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This is the (R,R) isomer. It is the enantiomer of the (S,S) isomer and a diastereomer of the meso (R,S) form. The (R,R) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.

Let's verify the chirality. The carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, the ring path -CH2-CH=CH- (C2-C3-C4), and the ring path -CH2-CH2-CH= (C6-C5-C4). Since these two paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer `(R)` is specified, so it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Due to the symmetric 1,3,5-substitution pattern, the carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not chiral centers. For example, at C1, the path C1-C2-C3(OH)-C4-C5(OH)-C6 is identical to the path C1-C6-C5(OH)-C4-C3(OH)-C2. Thus, the two ring attachments to C1 are identical. The same applies to C3 and C5. Furthermore, any stereoisomer of this compound (e.g., all-cis or cis-trans) will possess at least one plane of symmetry. For instance, the all-`cis` isomer has three planes of symmetry. The notation (1s,3s,5s) is non-standard, but it cannot make an inherently achiral structure chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl ring)\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We look for any chiral centers (sp3 carbons with four different substituents).\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring consists of -CH2- groups.

This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   The presence of `R` and `S` descriptors signifies the absolute configuration at chiral centers. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the compound must be chiral. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   However, the molecule is symmetric, meaning the groups on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group).\n    *   In such cases, the diastereomer with opposite configurations at the two identical chiral centers (one R, one S) is called a *meso* compound.\n    *   A meso compound is achiral because it has an internal element of symmetry (in this case, a center of inversion when drawn appropriately) and is superimposable on its mirror image. Achiral compounds are not optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The `(2R,3R)` configuration is diastereomeric to the meso `(2R,3S)` form.\n    *   The `(2R,3R)` isomer and its mirror image, the `(2S,3S)` isomer, are not superimposable on each other. They form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:**\n    *   The name specifies a single enantiomer, the `(R)` isomer.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the alkene part of the ring (`-CH=CH-`), and the alkane part of the ring (`-CH2-CH2-`).\n    *   Since a single enantiomer is specified, it is a chiral compound and will be optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:**\n    *   This nomenclature typically refers to the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (the *cis* isomer).\n    *   This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a C3 axis of rotation perpendicular to the ring. More importantly, it has three vertical planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:**\n    *   Let's determine the structure from the IUPAC name. The parent chain is `butan-1-one`, which is a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. A cyclopentyl group is attached to C1, and a methyl group is attached to C3.\n    *   The structure is: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. This can also be seen as a ketone formed from a cyclopentyl group and an isobutyl group `((CH3)2CH-CH2-)`.\n    *   We need to check for chiral centers. The only candidate is C3 of the butane chain. Let's analyze the groups attached to it by tracing the chain from that carbon:\n        *   The structure can be written as `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n        *   The carbon in question is the `CH` of the isobutyl group. It is bonded to one H atom, two methyl (-CH3) groups, and one `-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl` group.\n    *   Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no other chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of one or more stereocenters and the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. Let's check for chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n        *   C1 and C2 are `sp2` hybridized and part of a double bond; they cannot be chiral centers.\n        *   The CH2 carbon (C3) is bonded to two identical hydrogen atoms. Not a chiral center.\n        *   The terminal CH3 carbon (C4) is bonded to three identical hydrogen atoms. Not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. Furthermore, the entire molecule is planar. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule, a derivative of a norbornane-type skeleton.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name itself provides the crucial information.\n        *   The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` indicate the presence of at least two stereocenters (at positions 3a and 7a) with a specific configuration.\n        *   A specific enantiomer is named. For a molecule to be named with specific `R` and `S` configurations for its stereocenters (and not be described as meso), it must be a chiral molecule.\n        *   Let's consider the possibility of it being a meso compound. The parent structure (without the C8 substituent) could potentially have a plane of symmetry. However, the substituent `8-(chloromethylene)` which is `=CHCl` is located on the methano bridge of the norbornane system. This substituent is asymmetric and breaks any potential plane of symmetry in the parent skeleton.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral, and a specific enantiomer is given. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n        *   The substituents on C2 and C3 are identical: -H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other -CH(CH3)COOH group.\n        *   When a molecule has multiple stereocenters and the groups on these centers are identical, there is a possibility of a meso form.\n        *   The specified configuration is `(2R,3S)`. For a molecule like this, the isomer with opposite configurations (one R, one S) has a plane of symmetry between the two stereocenters.\n        *   Let's visualize the Fischer projection for the (2R,3S) isomer.\n            ```\n                  COOH\n                   |\n            CH3 -- C -- H   (R)\n                   |\n              H -- C -- CH3   (S)\n                   |\n                  COOH\n            ```\n            There is a plane of symmetry cutting horizontally between C2 and C3.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral due to internal symmetry, making them optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is another stereoisomer of the same molecule.\n        *   The configuration is `(2R,3R)`. This isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a chiral molecule. A sample consisting of a single enantiomer like `(2R,3R)` will be optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's check for stereocenters.\n        *   Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, C2 (part of -CH=CH-), and C6 (part of -CH2-CH2-). Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n        *   A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral.\n        *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a chiral molecule, and a specific enantiomer is given. It is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Analysis:** The nomenclature `(1s,3s,5s)` is used to denote relative stereochemistry, typically meaning all three substituents are *cis* (on the same side of the ring).\n        *   Let's visualize the chair conformation. In the most stable conformation of the all-cis isomer, the three -OH groups can occupy the 1, 3, and 5 axial positions (all pointing \"up,\" for example).\n        *   This molecule, despite having stereocenters (C1, C3, C5), is highly symmetrical. It has a C3 axis of rotation and, more importantly, three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the opposite carbon atom (e.g., the plane containing C1, O1, and C4).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's search for any chiral elements.\n        *   **Chiral Centers:** There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The -CH(CH3)2 group has two identical methyl groups, so the CH carbon is not chiral. All carbons in the cyclopentyl ring have at least two identical substituents (either two hydrogens or two identical paths around the ring from the point of attachment).\n        *   **Other sources of chirality:** The molecule is not an allene, spirane, or atropisomer. There is free rotation around the single bonds.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Compound                                                                        | Chiral?          | Optically Active? |\n| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------- | :---------------- |\n| (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene                                                  | No (Achiral)     | No                |\n| (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione       | Yes (Chiral)     | Yes               |\n| (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid                                               | No (Meso)        | No                |\n| (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid                                               | Yes (Chiral)     | Yes               |\n| (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol                                                          | Yes (Chiral)     | Yes               |\n| (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol                                              | No (Achiral)     | No                |\n| 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one                                               | No (Achiral)     | No                |\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity, we have three:\n1.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) is a common indicator of chirality, but the molecule as a whole must be asymmetric (i.e., it must not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is CH(Cl)=C(CH3)CH2CH3.\n    *   This is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   There are no stereocenters.\n    *   Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   This name describes a complex bicyclic molecule. The key information is in the stereodescriptors: (3aR, 7aS).\n    *   These descriptors indicate the absolute configuration at two specific stereocenters, C-3a and C-7a.\n    *   Naming a compound as a specific R/S isomer means we are considering a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is by definition optically active.\n    *   While some molecules with multiple stereocenters can be achiral (meso compounds, like the (2R,3S) isomer below), this typically requires a high degree of symmetry. The parent structure (endo-norbornane anhydride) is meso, but the presence of the unsymmetrical `=C(E)HCl` substituent at the bridge carbon (C8) destroys the plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is chiral, and since a specific enantiomer is given, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Thus, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above.

The carbon atom CH(CH3)2 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter. No other carbon atom is bonded to four different groups.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters.

While some molecules with both R and S centers can be meso, the complex and unsymmetrical nature of the substituents (an (E)-chloromethylene group on the bridge) makes the presence of a plane of symmetry or center of inversion extremely unlikely. Naming a specific configuration `(3aR,7aS...)` designates a single chiral molecule. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3. The specific stereoisomer is (2R,3S). Let's examine its structure. If we draw it in an anti-periplanar (staggered) conformation and look down the C2-C3 bond, we can see that there is a center of inversion. The -COOH group on C2 is opposite to the -COOH on C3, the -CH3 on C2 is opposite to the -CH3 on C3, and the -H on C2 is opposite to the -H on C3. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. This is a classic example of a meso compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the compound above. It has two stereocenters, both with the R configuration. This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound, which is non-superimposable. Therefore, the (2R,3R) isomer is a chiral molecule. A sample consisting of only the (2R,3R) enantiomer will be optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the -CH2-CH= group (path towards C2), and (4) the -CH2-CH2-CH= group (path towards C6). Since the paths around the ring are different, C1 is a stereocenter. The name specifies the (R) configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The molecule as a whole lacks any internal symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The notation (1s,3s,5s) indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Analysis:** This highly symmetrical molecule possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry (σv). Each plane of symmetry passes through one carbon bearing an -OH group and the carbon atom opposite to it. For example, a plane contains C1-O1 and C4. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl. This is isobutyl cyclopentyl ketone.\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to check for any stereocenters.\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring has no substituents, so no chiral centers there.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized.\n        *   The -CH2- group next to the carbonyl is not chiral.\n        *   The next carbon is a -CH- group, which is bonded to a hydrogen and two identical methyl groups (-CH3). Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters and no other elements of chirality (like planar or axial chirality). It is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are three optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically means the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. We check for chiral centers and overall molecular symmetry.\n        *   There are no stereocenters (no carbon with four different single-bonded substituents).\n        *   However, chirality can also arise from the arrangement of groups around a double bond (planar chirality). The carbons of the double bond are C1 and C2.\n        *   Groups on C1: `Cl` and `H`. These are different.\n        *   Groups on C2: `-CH3` (methyl) and `-CH2CH3` (ethyl). These are different.\n        *   The molecule has the general structure `abC=Cde` where `a`≠`b` and `d`≠`e`. Let's draw the (Z)-isomer, where the high-priority groups on each carbon are on the same side. Priority(C1): `Cl` > `H`. Priority(C2): `-CH2CH3` > `-CH3`.\n            ```\n              Cl   CH2CH3\n               \\ /\n                C=C\n               / \\\n              H   CH3\n            ```\n        *   This molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The plane of the double bond is not a molecular plane of symmetry because of the constitution of the ethyl and methyl groups. Therefore, the molecule is chiral. Since it is a specific stereoisomer ((Z)-isomer), it will be optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active. **(1)**\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides the crucial information.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name includes stereochemical descriptors: `(3aR,7aS,E)`. These descriptors specify a single, unique stereoisomer. The parent structure (without the `8-(chloromethylene)` group) can be meso, but the addition of the `=CHCl` substituent breaks this symmetry. A molecule designated with specific R/S configurations is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound (unless it happens to be a meso compound, which is not the case here). A single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active. **(2)**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to check if this specific stereoisomer (`2R,3S`) is chiral or meso. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry.\n    *   Drawing the Fischer projection for the (2R, 3S) isomer reveals that it has a center of inversion (i), which makes it achiral. Alternatively, a staggered Newman projection or 3D model shows a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3 in the anti-conformation of the carboxyl groups. This is the definition of a *meso* compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive (meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This is another stereoisomer of the same molecule.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the `(R,R)` diastereomer. Unlike the `(R,S)` meso form, the `(R,R)` isomer and its mirror image, the `(S,S)` isomer, are not superimposable. The `(R,R)` isomer lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is therefore chiral. As a single, specified enantiomer, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active. **(3)**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at a stereocenter. This implies the molecule is chiral. Let's verify. Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) `-OH`, (2) `-H`, (3) `-CH2-CH=` (path towards C2), and (4) `-CH2-CH2-CH=` (path towards C6). Since the paths around the ring are different, C1 is indeed a stereocenter. The molecule as a whole is chiral. Since it's given as a single enantiomer `(R)`, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active. **(4)**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptors `(1s,3s,5s)` or the more common `cis` indicate that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all axial or all equatorial).\n    *   **Analysis:** This highly symmetric molecule is achiral. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry (each plane containing one C-OH group and bisecting the opposite C-C bond). Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral (meso).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The IUPAC name describes a ketone. The parent chain is butan-1-one, with the carbonyl at C1. A cyclopentyl group is attached to C1, and a methyl group is on C3. The structure is `cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`. This is also known as cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone: `cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Analysis:** We check for stereocenters. The carbon atom in the `CH(CH3)2` group is attached to a hydrogen, a `-CH2-` group, and two identical methyl groups (`-CH3`). Since it is attached to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter. There are no other stereocenters in the molecule. The molecule has a plane of symmetry in certain conformations, making it achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Optically active:\n    1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    3. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    4. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n- Optically inactive:\n    * (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    * (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    * 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are 4 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nThis question asks to identify which of the given compounds are optically active. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and present as a single enantiomer or in an enantiomerically enriched mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature causing chirality is a stereocenter, but the overall molecular symmetry determines chirality.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   This molecule contains a C=C double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C from methyl, C from ethyl) lie in a single plane.\n    *   A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. There are no such sp3-hybridized carbons in this molecule.\n    *   Since the molecule is planar, it possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Therefore, it is achiral and not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3a and 7a). The descriptor `(E)` specifies the geometry of the chloromethylene (`=CH-Cl`) double bond.\n    *   The presence of stereochemical descriptors like `R` and `S` in the name of a compound indicates that a specific stereoisomer is being referred to.\n    *   While some molecules with multiple stereocenters can be achiral (meso compounds), this is usually due to a high degree of symmetry. The parent skeleton, `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione`, can be meso. However, the substituent `8-(chloromethylene)` is asymmetric (`=CH-Cl`). This substituent breaks any pre-existing plane of symmetry in the parent molecule.\n    *   The molecule is therefore chiral. By specifying a single stereoisomer (`3aR,7aS,E`), the name refers to a pure enantiomer (or diastereomer if other chiral centers exist), which is optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule is symmetric because the two ends are identical (COOH groups).\n    *   Let's consider the stereoisomers. There are the enantiomeric pair (2R,3R) and (2S,3S), and the diastereomer (2R,3S).\n    *   The (2R,3S) isomer has opposite configurations at its two stereocenters. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, the (2R,3S) isomer possesses a center of inversion (in its anti-periplanar conformation) and a plane of symmetry (in its eclipsed conformation). This makes it a meso compound.\n    *   Meso compounds are achiral, even though they have stereocenters, because they are superimposable on their mirror image. Therefore, this compound is not optically active.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) isomer is chiral. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, and they are non-superimposable.\n    *   Since (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and an OH group at C1.\n    *   Let's examine C1. It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -OH group\n        2.  -H atom\n        3.  The ring segment `-CH2-CH=` (path C1-C2-C3)\n        4.  The ring segment `-CH=CH-CH2-` (path C1-C6-C5-C4)\n    *   Since the four groups are different, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` indicates the relative stereochemistry, implying all three OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's check the carbons C1, C3, and C5. For C1, the two paths around the ring, -C2-C3(OH)-C4-C5(OH)-C6- and -C6-C5(OH)-C4-C3(OH)-C2-, are identical. Thus, C1 is not a stereocenter (it is a prochiral center). The same applies to C3 and C5.\n    *   The molecule has high symmetry. Specifically, the all-cis isomer possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bond.\n    *   Due to these elements of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and therefore not optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The IUPAC name describes a ketone. `...butan-1-one` attached to a `cyclopentyl` group means the structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-(chain)`. The chain is `3-methylbutyl`.\n    *   The acid `3-methylbutanoic acid` is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-COOH`.\n    *   So, the ketone has the structure `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. This is also known as cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone.\n    *   Let's check for stereocenters. The carbon in `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to a hydrogen, a `CH2` group, and two identical `CH3` groups. It is not a stereocenter. The cyclopentyl ring is attached to an achiral group. The molecule as a whole is flexible and possesses conformations with a plane of symmetry.\n    *   The molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe have identified the following optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it is optically active. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. Chirality means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators are the presence of stereocenters and the absence of internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, CH3, CH2CH3) lie in the same plane.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and therefore optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides critical information.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters. This means the name refers to a single, specific stereoisomer. A single stereoisomer is chiral unless it is a meso compound. Given the complexity and unsymmetrical substitution (`8-(chloromethylene)`), the molecule is certain to lack any internal symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The name specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. Therefore, it is optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. It possesses two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The substituents on C2 and C3 are the same (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). The configurations are opposite (R and S). This is the definition of a *meso* compound. Meso compounds are achiral because they possess an internal element of symmetry (a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion in at least one conformer).\n    *   **Conclusion:** As a meso compound, it is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a diastereomer of the compound above. It has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Both stereocenters have the same (R) configuration. This molecule does not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is therefore a chiral molecule. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The name specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral pair. Therefore, it is optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Let's check C1 for chirality. It is bonded to four different groups: (1) -H, (2) -OH, (3) the ring path -CH2-CH=, and (4) the ring path -CH2-C5H2-C4H=. Because the paths around the ring are different (one path encounters the double bond sooner than the other), C1 is a stereocenter. The molecule is chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The name `(R)-...` specifies a single enantiomer. Therefore, it is optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor 's' usually denotes relative stereochemistry (cis/trans). Assuming it means all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. C1 is bonded to -H, -OH, and two identical paths around the ring (-C2H2-C3H(OH)-... and -C6H2-C5H(OH)-...). Thus, C1, C3, and C5 are not stereocenters. The all-cis isomer possesses a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry. The other diastereomer (one OH trans to the other two) also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral due to its high symmetry. It is optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule's formula is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** We need to check for any stereocenters. A review of all carbon atoms reveals none. The carbon in the `CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups. All other carbons are either sp2 hybridized or are part of a CH2 group or have two identical paths in the ring. The molecule has no stereocenter.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks any internal planes of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   The molecule is planar around the carbon-carbon double bond. A planar molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex, bridged bicyclic molecule.\n    *   The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors: `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the molecule has chiral centers and a specific stereoisomer (a single enantiomer) is being described.\n    *   A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active. The structure does not possess a plane of symmetry that would make it a meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3).\n    *   However, the two ends of the molecule are identical (COOH groups), and the substituents on the chiral carbons are also identical (H and CH3 on each).\n    *   The stereochemistry is `(2R,3S)`, which means the two chiral centers have opposite configurations. In a molecule with two identical chiral centers, the R,S (or S,R) configuration results in a *meso* compound.\n    *   Meso compounds have an internal plane of symmetry and are **achiral**, despite having chiral centers. They are optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound.\n    *   The stereochemistry is `(2R,3R)`. Both chiral centers have the same configuration.\n    *   This molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is not superimposable on its mirror image (which is the (2S,3S) isomer).\n    *   Thus, the `(2R,3R)` isomer is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound and is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at C1. The carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and (4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different due to the asymmetric location of the double bond relative to C1.\n    *   Therefore, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups in a *cis* relationship (all pointing in the same direction relative to the ring, e.g., all axial or all equatorial in a chair conformation).\n    *   This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH bond and bisecting the opposite C-C bond.\n    *   Due to these planes of symmetry, the molecule is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   Let's determine the structure from the IUPAC name. The parent chain is `butan-1-one`, indicating a 4-carbon chain with a ketone function at C1. `C4-C3-C2-C1(=O)-`. A `cyclopentyl` group is attached to C1, and a `methyl` group is attached to C3.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. This can also be seen as isobutyl cyclopentyl ketone.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The only potential chiral center is C3.\n    *   The C3 atom is bonded to four groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H).\n        2.  A methyl group from the end of the chain (-CH3, which is C4).\n        3.  The `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group.\n        4.  A substituent methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   So, the groups on C3 are -H, -CH3, -CH3, and the rest of the chain. Let's write the structure more clearly: `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. The carbon in the `CH` group is C3. It is attached to H, two identical -CH3 groups, and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group.\n    *   Since C3 is attached to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has a plane of symmetry (containing the H-C3-C2-C1=O bonds and bisecting the angle between the two C3-methyl bonds).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\nSummary of optically active compounds:\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione** (Yes)\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid** (Yes)\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol** (Yes)\n\nTotal count of optically active compounds is 3.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nA molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers). However, a molecule with stereocenters can still be achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion; such a compound is called a meso compound.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃. This molecule contains a C=C double bond, but no stereocenters (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). The molecule is planar and thus has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), making it achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself provides the key information. The prefixes `(3aR,7aS)` indicate the presence of at least two chiral centers with a specific absolute configuration. This defines a single stereoisomer. For a compound with multiple stereocenters to be inactive, it must be a meso compound. Given the complexity and lack of symmetry of the bridged ring system, especially with an attached `(E)-chloromethylene` group (=CHCl), it is extremely unlikely that the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. A specific, single enantiomer like this is, by definition, chiral. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH₃, COOH). The `(2R,3S)` configuration means the two stereocenters have opposite configurations. This is the defining characteristic of the meso isomer of this compound. A meso compound has a plane of symmetry and/or a center of inversion, making it achiral despite having stereocenters. Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration indicates that the two stereocenters have the same configuration. This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion and is chiral. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer. As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This molecule has a stereocenter at C1. The four groups attached to C1 are: -OH, -H, the ring segment -CH₂-CH=CH-, and the ring segment -CH₂-CH₂-CH=. These two ring segments are different. Since there is only one stereocenter, the molecule is guaranteed to be chiral. The name `(R)-` specifies one of the two enantiomers. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The `(1s,3s,5s)` nomenclature suggests the *cis,cis* relative stereochemistry, meaning all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. In its most stable chair conformation, all three -OH groups are in equatorial positions. This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry (each one passing through a C-OH group and the opposite CH₂ group) as well as a C₃ axis of rotation. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are prochiral, not chiral centers. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl ring). Let's examine the molecule for stereocenters. The carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and not a stereocenter. No carbon in the cyclopentyl ring is a stereocenter as the paths around the ring from the point of attachment are identical. In the isobutyl group, the C3 atom is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter. With no stereocenters or any other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality), the molecule is achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

This `R,S` combination in a molecule with identical chiral centers leads to a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, which makes it superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.

The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, it is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This compound has two possible stereoisomers: one where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis), and one where two are on one side and one is on the other (cis-trans).\n    *   The all-cis isomer is highly symmetric (point group C3v) and possesses three planes of symmetry. It is **achiral**.\n    *   The cis-trans isomer also possesses a plane of symmetry (point group Cs). It is also **achiral**.\n    *   Since both stereoisomers of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol are achiral, this compound is not optically active regardless of the specific isomer.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl ring)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We check for chiral centers.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon is not chiral.\n        *   The -CH2- carbon is not chiral.\n        *   The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to a -H, two identical -CH3 groups, and the rest of the molecule.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of one or more chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. If a molecule has more than one chiral center, it can be achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion; such a compound is called a meso compound. We will analyze each compound to determine if it is chiral.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers (an sp3 carbon with four different substituents). There are no chiral centers in this molecule.

A compound is optically active if it is chiral and present as a single enantiomer. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of one or more stereocenters and the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The double bond is between C1 and C2.\n    *   This molecule has a double bond, but no chiral centers (carbon atoms bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule is essentially planar. A plane containing all the atoms of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule.\n    *   The name provides the specific stereochemistry: `(3aR,7aS,E)`.

Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **achiral** (meso) and optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. The stereochemistry is (2R, 3R).\n    *   Let's draw its Fischer projection:\n        ```\n             COOH\n              |\n        H ---|--- CH3  (C2 is R)\n              |\n        H ---|--- CH3  (C3 is R)\n              |\n             COOH\n        ```\n    *   This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S, 3S) isomer.\n    *   The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with an alcohol group at C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        2.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n        3.  -CH2-CH= (path towards C2)\n        4.  -CH2-CH2-CH= (path towards C6)\n    *   Since the two paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any element of symmetry.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor 's' in this context implies that the substituents have the same relative stereochemistry (all cis). This means all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring's plane.\n    *   Let's check for chirality at C1. The groups are H, OH, and two paths around the ring: -CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2- and -CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-. These two paths are identical. Therefore, C1 is not a chiral center. By symmetry, C3 and C5 are also not chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule possesses planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through the C1-OH bond and the C4 atom bisects the ring, with C2 and C6 being mirror images, and C3 and C5 being mirror images. Since C3 and C5 are identically substituted, this is a valid plane of symmetry. In fact, the molecule has three such planes of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is `(C5H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. The C5H9 group is a cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   Let's search for chiral centers. A carbon atom needs to be sp3 hybridized and bonded to four different groups.\n    *   In the butane chain: The carbonyl carbon is sp2. C2 is a -CH2- group. C3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH2- group, and two identical methyl (-CH3) groups. So, C3 is not chiral.\n    *   In the cyclopentyl ring: Every carbon is a -CH2- group, except for the one attached to the carbonyl. This carbon is bonded to the carbonyl chain, a hydrogen, and two -CH2- groups within the ring. The ring is unsubstituted, so the paths around the ring are identical. Thus, no carbon in the ring is chiral.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and is not of a type that exhibits chirality without one. It is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n- (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n- (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n- (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n- 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nTo determine if a compound is optically active, we need to assess its chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and is not present as a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers). The compounds listed are given as specific stereoisomers (or without any stereochemical designation, implying a racemic mixture or an achiral compound). We will analyze each one for chirality. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature leading to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups), but the ultimate test is the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion in the molecule.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1 and C2) and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane of the molecule itself serves as a plane of symmetry. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Analysis:** The name explicitly includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This notation is used to specify the absolute configuration of specific chiral centers in the molecule, meaning a single enantiomer is being described. While the parent structure (without the `8-(chloromethylene)` group) is a meso compound and thus achiral, the addition of a substituent breaks the internal symmetry. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule possesses two chiral centers (C2 and C3). The substituents on C2 are identical to those on C3. The configurations are given as opposite `(R,S)`. This is the definition of a meso compound. A meso compound has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry and is achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It has two chiral centers with the same configuration `(R,R)`. The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` stereoisomer. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Analysis:** The carbon atom with the `-OH` group (C1) is bonded to four different groups: (1) `-H`, (2) `-OH`, (3) `-CH2-CH=CH-` (pathway around the ring in one direction), and (4) `-CH2-CH2-CH=` (pathway around the ring in the other direction). The two pathways around the ring are different due to the location of the double bond. Therefore, C1 is a chiral center. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Analysis:** This name, with identical stereodescriptors, most likely refers to the highly symmetric all-cis isomer. In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. Let's check the potential chiral centers C1, C3, and C5. From C1, the path to C2 and then to C3(OH) is identical to the path to C6 and then to C5(OH). Thus, the carbons bearing the OH groups are not chiral centers. The molecule has several planes of symmetry (e.g., a plane passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite CH2 group). It is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's look for any chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized. The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. In the cyclopentyl ring, the carbon attached to the carbonyl is bonded to two identical `-CH2-` groups within the ring. The molecule has no chiral centers. It also has a plane of symmetry in achievable conformations. Thus, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\nCounting the number of optically active compounds from the list:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it is optically active. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for a molecule to be chiral are the presence of a chiral center or other elements of chirality (like axial, planar, or helical chirality) and the absence of any internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   This molecule contains a C=C double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C of methyl, C of ethyl) lie in the same plane.\n    *   This planarity creates a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), which makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   There are no chiral centers (carbon atoms bonded to four different groups).\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides the crucial information.\n    *   The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters. The `(E)` specifies the geometry of a double bond.\n    *   Naming a compound with specific absolute configurations (R/S) implies that it is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. A single enantiomer is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   The only exception would be if the molecule were a *meso* compound (an achiral compound with stereocenters). However, the structure and the naming `(3aR,7aS)` for the given complex skeleton do not correspond to a typical meso compound. The presence of the unsymmetrical `=(E)-CHCl` substituent further ensures the molecule lacks the necessary symmetry to be achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is a specific chiral molecule and is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as the substituents on C3 (-H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other -CH(CH3)COOH group). These are called equivalent stereocenters.\n    *   For molecules with two equivalent stereocenters, the diastereomer with the `(R,S)` or `(S,R)` configuration is a *meso* compound.\n    *   A meso compound has stereocenters, but it is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. In its anti-periplanar conformation, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has a center of inversion.\n    *   Since it is achiral, it is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The `(2R,3R)` isomer is a diastereomer of the meso `(2R,3S)` form.\n    *   The mirror image of the `(2R,3R)` isomer is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. These two `(R,R)` and `(S,S)` isomers are non-superimposable and form a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   Since the `(2R,3R)` isomer is a single enantiomer and is chiral, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and a hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH=CH- (part of the ring), and -CH2-CH2- (the other part of the ring). Therefore, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule does not possess any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   The name `(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol` specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This name describes a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptors `(1s,3s,5s)` typically refer to the relative stereochemistry, indicating that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   In this all-cis isomer, the two paths around the ring from any of the substituted carbons (C1, C3, C5) are identical. For example, from C1, the path C1-C2-C3(-OH)... is the same as C1-C6-C5(-OH)... Therefore, C1, C3, and C5 are not technically chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (σv).\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The IUPAC name `butan-1-one` designates a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. This requires a substituent on C1, which is the `1-cyclopentyl` group. The `3-methyl` is a substituent on C3 of the butane chain.\n    *   The structure is: `cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers (sp3 carbons with four different substituents).\n    *   The only potential candidate is C3 of the butan-1-one chain.\n    *   The four groups attached to C3 are:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -CH3 (the C4 of the butane chain)\n        3.  -CH3 (the methyl group from the \"3-methyl\" substituent)\n        4.  -CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl (the rest of the molecule)\n    *   Since two of the groups attached to C3 are identical methyl groups, C3 is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no other stereocenters and is achiral. It has a plane of symmetry in a suitable conformation.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.

The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C from methyl, C from ethyl) lie in the same plane.\n    *   **Chirality**: This molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry coinciding with the plane of the molecule itself. Therefore, it is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion**: It is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a complex, bridged bicyclic compound. The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors: (3aR, 7aS) for two stereocenters at the ring fusion and (E) for the configuration of the exocyclic double bond (=CHCl).\n    *   **Chirality**: When a specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is designated by R/S notation, it is, by definition, optically active. The complex structure with defined stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and an unsymmetrical substituent (=CHCl) is highly unlikely to possess any internal symmetry that would make it a meso compound. The explicit naming of a single stereoisomer implies it has been resolved or synthesized in an enantiomerically pure form.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, and thus it is optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (-H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other chiral carbon group).\n    *   **Chirality**: This molecule is a classic example used to illustrate the concept of meso compounds. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The (2R,3S) configuration (which is identical to 2S,3R) corresponds to the meso isomer.\n    *   We can see this by drawing its conformation. In an eclipsed conformation (looking down the C2-C3 bond), there is a plane of symmetry between the two carbons. In a staggered conformation (with COOH groups anti), there is a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is a meso compound. It is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a diastereomer of the compound above. It has the same connectivity but a different spatial arrangement.\n    *   **Chirality**: The (2R,3R) isomer does not have any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, and they are not superimposable. A specific enantiomer like (2R,3R) will rotate plane-polarized light.\n    *   **Conclusion**: It is a chiral molecule, and the single enantiomer specified is optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and a hydroxyl group on C1.\n    *   **Chirality**: The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the ring segment -CH2-C6-, and 4) the ring segment -CH2-C2-. Tracing the paths around the ring from C1, one path immediately encounters a double bond (-C2-C3=C4-), while the other does not (-C6-C5-C4=). Thus, the two ring pathways are different, making C1 a stereocenter. The name specifies the (R)-enantiomer. The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion**: It is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule and is therefore optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor (1s,3s,5s) or simply \"cis\" indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (e.g., all pointing up).\n    *   **Chirality**: If we consider the chair conformation where the three OH groups are all in axial positions (or all in equatorial positions), the molecule has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3). More importantly for chirality, it has three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one carbon bearing an OH group and the opposite CH2 group on the ring (e.g., the plane containing C1 and C4). Because it possesses planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: It is an achiral molecule and optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   **Chirality**: To be chiral, a molecule typically needs a stereocenter or another element of chirality.

C1 is a stereocenter because it is attached to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH2-CH=, and -CH2-CH2-CH=.\n    *   The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Since the name describes a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is cyclohexane with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all on the same side of the ring (cis).\n    *   Let's consider its chair conformation. With all OH groups in axial positions, the molecule has three planes of symmetry, each passing through a C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. It also has a C3 axis of rotation.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry means the molecule is achiral. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are prochiral, not true stereocenters, because the path around the ring from these positions is identical in both directions.\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The IUPAC name describes a butan-1-one parent chain, substituted with a cyclopentyl group at C1 and a methyl group at C3.\n    *   The structure is: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. This is also known as isobutyl cyclopentyl ketone, `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   We need to check for any chiral centers. The only potential candidate is C3 of the butanoyl chain. However, this carbon atom is bonded to two identical methyl groups (one being C4 of the chain and one being the substituent), a hydrogen atom, and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Since it is attached to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The rest of the molecule also lacks any stereocenters or other elements of chirality.\n    *   The molecule is achiral and therefore **not optically active**.\n\nSummary of optically active compounds:\n- (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: Yes\n- (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: No (meso)\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Yes\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes\n- (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: No (achiral)\n- 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No (achiral)\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThis question requires us to determine how many of the given compounds are chiral. A compound is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Chiral compounds are optically active. We will analyze each compound for elements of chirality, such as chiral centers, and the absence of elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. There are no chiral centers (sp3 carbons with four different substituents). The molecule is planar around the double bond. This plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    This compound's IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. The R/S notation is used to specify the absolute configuration of chiral centers. The naming of a specific enantiomer implies that the compound is chiral and has been resolved from its mirror image. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3). However, the substituents on C2 (`-H`, `-CH3`, `-COOH`, and `-CH(CH3)COOH`) are the same as the substituents on C3. For such symmetrically substituted molecules, the stereoisomer with an (R,S) or (S,R) configuration is a *meso* compound. A meso compound is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it superimposable on its mirror image. Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid are a pair of enantiomers. They are chiral and non-superimposable on their mirror images. As a single, specific enantiomer, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and a hydroxyl group at C1. The carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) `-OH`, (2) `-H`, (3) `-CH2-CH=`, and (4) `-CH2-CH2-CH=`. The two paths around the ring from C1 are different, so C1 is a chiral center. The name specifies a single enantiomer `(R)`. This compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation, although non-standard, likely implies that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (the *all-cis* isomer). This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. It has a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one hydroxylated carbon and the carbon at the opposite side of the ring. Due to the presence of these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**. The other possible stereoisomer (one -OH trans to the other two) is also achiral.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    Let's determine the structure from the IUPAC name. The parent chain is `butan-1-one`, which means a four-carbon chain with a ketone at position 1: `C4-C3-C2-C1(=O)`. There is a methyl substituent at C3 and a cyclopentyl group at C1. The full structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. We need to check for chiral centers. Let's analyze C3. It is bonded to: (1) a hydrogen atom, (2) the terminal methyl group (C4), (3) the methyl substituent, and (4) the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Groups (2) and (3) are both methyl groups, so they are identical. Since C3 does not have four different substituents, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no other potential chiral centers and no other elements of chirality. Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   Optically Active: (2), (4), (5)\n*   Optically Inactive: (1), (3), (6), (7)\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. A compound with stereocenters but also an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is called a meso compound and is achiral (optically inactive).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** ClHC=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C of methyl, C of ethyl) lie in a single plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral. Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The key part of the name is the stereochemical descriptors: **(3aR,7aS,E)**.\n    *   **Analysis:** These descriptors specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3a and 7a) and the geometry of a double bond (E). The designation of a specific enantiomer (using R/S notation) for a complex molecule that does not possess internal symmetry (it is not a meso compound) means the molecule is chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A pure sample of a single enantiomer is always optically active. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereocenters have opposite configurations (one R, one S). The substituents on C2 (H, CH₃, COOH) are identical to those on C3. Let's visualize the molecule. It's possible to find a conformation that possesses a center of inversion midway between the C2-C3 bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. This is a classic example of a **meso compound**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Meso compounds are achiral and thus optically inactive. Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. The two stereocenters are C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereocenters have the same configuration (both R). This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, which is non-superimposable. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Conclusion:** As a chiral molecule, a pure sample of the (2R,3R) enantiomer is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group on C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the -CH₂-CH₂- path, and the -CH=CH- path. Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter. The name specifies a single enantiomer, the (R)-isomer. A molecule with a single stereocenter is chiral (unless it can racemize under ambient conditions, which is not the case here).\n    *   **Conclusion:** A pure sample of the (R) enantiomer is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with -OH groups at C1, C3, and C5.\n    *   **Analysis:** This name is subtle. The lowercase `s` descriptor is the IUPAC designation for absolute configuration (equivalent to `S`), often used for pseudoasymmetric centers or in specific compound classes. The use of absolute configuration descriptors like `(1s,3s,5s)` implies that C1, C3, and C5 are true stereocenters. This can only happen if the molecule as a whole is chiral. The all-cis isomer of cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol is highly symmetric (it has a C₃ axis and three planes of symmetry) and is achiral; its C1, C3, C5 atoms are not stereocenters because the paths around the ring are identical. Therefore, the name must refer to a chiral diastereomer, specifically the one where two -OH groups are cis to each other and one is trans. This diastereomer is chiral, and the name specifies one of its two enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the name specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-(C₅H₉).\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's search for stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH₂- group, and two identical methyl (-CH₃) groups. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter. No other atom in the molecule is a stereocenter. The molecule also possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule is achiral, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Optically inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. (3 compounds)\n- Optically active: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. (4 compounds)\n\nThere are 4 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) and the absence of any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The double bond geometry is Z (cis), meaning the Cl and the ethyl group (-CH2CH3) are on the same side of the double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule contains a double bond. All atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2, H on C1, Cl on C1, C of methyl, C of ethyl) lie in the same plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the molecule (assuming free rotation of the ethyl group). There are no chiral centers in the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex tricyclic molecule. The name itself provides the crucial information.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)` indicate the presence of chiral centers with a specific absolute configuration. A name that specifies a single stereoisomer with `R` or `S` designations implies that the molecule is chiral and the name refers to one of its enantiomers. While some molecules with chiral centers can be achiral (meso compounds), this molecule's complex and unsymmetrical structure (due to the E-chloromethylene group, `=CHCl`, and the tricyclic core) makes it extremely unlikely to have a plane of symmetry or center of inversion. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and therefore **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The `(2R, 3S)` designation indicates the stereochemistry. Let's analyze its symmetry. If you draw the molecule in a staggered conformation or a Fischer projection, you can identify a center of inversion (`i`) halfway along the C2-C3 bond. In an eclipsed conformation, a plane of symmetry (σ) becomes apparent. The presence of these symmetry elements means the molecule is achiral, despite having two chiral centers. This is a classic example of a meso compound.\n        ```\n          COOH\n          |\n      H --|-- CH3   (2R)\n          |\n    CH3 --|-- H     (3S)\n          |\n          COOH\n        (Center of inversion is present)\n        ```\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a meso compound, which is achiral. It is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a diastereomer of the previous compound, `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH` with the `(2R,3R)` configuration.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This stereoisomer lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` compound, which is non-superimposable. The `(2R,3R)` and `(2S,3S)` forms constitute a pair of enantiomers.\n        ```\n              COOH\n              |\n          H --|-- CH3   (2R)\n              |\n          H --|-- CH3   (3R)\n              |\n              COOH\n        (No internal symmetry elements)\n        ```\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and therefore **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the ring segment `-CH2-CH=` (path C2-C3), and 4) the ring segment `-CH2-CH2-` (path C6-C5). Since these four groups are different, C1 is a chiral center. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and a specific enantiomer is given. It is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation implies that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (the all-cis isomer).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** There are two possible stereoisomers for 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol: the all-cis isomer and the cis,trans isomer (one -OH trans to the other two).\n        *   The all-cis isomer possesses a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry contains one C-OH bond and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring.\n        *   The cis,trans isomer (e.g., 1,3-cis, 5-trans) also possesses a plane of symmetry passing through the carbon atom of the trans-substituent (C5) and the CH2 group opposite to it (C2).\n        Since both possible stereoisomers of this compound have at least one plane of symmetry, they are all achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The name indicates a butan-1-one parent chain, meaning a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. The group at C1 is cyclopentyl, and there is a methyl group at C3. This leads to the structure: `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We need to search for any chiral centers.\n        *   The isobutyl group `–CH2–CH(CH3)2` has no chiral center (the carbon with two methyl groups is not chiral).\n        *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized and not a chiral center.\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring has a single, achiral substituent. The ring itself retains a plane of symmetry.\n        The entire molecule is symmetrical and has no chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive (achiral)\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a 50/50 mixture of enantiomers (a racemic mixture). Naming a specific stereoisomer implies we are considering it in its pure form. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image, which is equivalent to saying it lacks any improper axis of rotation (S_n), including a plane of symmetry (σ = S_1) and a center of inversion (i = S_2).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H from C1; a C from methyl and a C from ethyl from C2) lie in a single plane. Due to the sp2 hybridization of the carbons in the double bond, the molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name explicitly defines a single, specific stereoisomer. The designations `(3aR,7aS)` refer to the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (chiral carbons). The existence of stable enantiomers with specific R/S configurations is a hallmark of a chiral molecule. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is not a racemic mixture. A pure enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. The four groups attached to C2 are the same as the four groups attached to C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). When a molecule has two identical stereocenters, the diastereomer with opposite configurations (one R, one S) is called a meso compound. A meso compound is achiral because it has an internal element of symmetry (in this case, a center of inversion). Achiral molecules are not optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not optically active (it's a meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It has the same configuration at both stereocenters (`R,R`). This stereoisomer lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Therefore, it is chiral. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer. The name specifies a single enantiomer, (2R,3R).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring containing one double bond, with a hydroxyl group on a saturated carbon.\n    *   **Analysis:** Carbon-1 is a stereocenter because it is attached to four different groups: an -OH group, a -H atom, a -CH=CH- segment of the ring (C2-C3 path), and a -CH2-CH2- segment of the ring (C6-C5 path). The molecule as a whole lacks internal symmetry. The name `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The nomenclature `(1s,3s,5s)` indicates that all three hydroxyl groups have the same relative orientation, meaning they are all on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Analysis:** This all-cis isomer is a highly symmetric molecule. It has three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the C-H bond on the opposite carbon of the ring. A molecule with even one plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (C5H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2\n    *   **Analysis:** We must check for any stereocenters or other elements of chirality. A stereocenter is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbons:\n        *   In the cyclopentyl ring: All are CH2 groups and thus not stereocenters.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon (C=O) is sp2 hybridized and not a stereocenter.\n        *   In the butanoyl chain: The carbons at positions 1 (-C=O-), 2 (-CH2-), and 4 (the two -CH3) are not stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups (-CH3), and the rest of the chain. Since it's bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter.\n        *   The molecule has no stereocenters and no other sources of chirality (e.g., axial, planar). Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not optically active.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically active compounds: 2, 4, 5.\n*   Optically inactive compounds: 1, 3, 6, 7.\n\nThere are **3** optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nTo determine if a compound is optically active, we need to check if it is chiral.

The key is the presence of stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. These indicate that the compound has defined chiral centers at positions 3a and 7a.\n    *   A specific, single stereoisomer of a molecule with chiral centers is optically active unless it is a meso compound.\n    *   The parent structure might have some symmetry, but the substituent `8-(chloromethylene)`, which is a `=CHCl` group, at position 8 and in the (E) configuration, will almost certainly break any plane of symmetry the parent bicyclic system might have had.\n    *   Given that a specific enantiomer is named, it is intended to represent a chiral molecule.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   It has two chiral centers, C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). This means we need to check for meso-possibility.\n    *   The configurations are opposite (2R, 3S). For a molecule of the type R-CH(X)-CH(X)-R, the (R,S) stereoisomer is the meso form.\n    *   Let's confirm the presence of a symmetry element. In the staggered anti-periplanar conformation, the molecule has a center of inversion (i). If you start at any atom or group and move through the midpoint of the C2-C3 bond to the other side, you find an identical atom or group.\n    *   Since it has a center of inversion, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. It has two chiral centers (C2, C3) with the same configuration (R,R).\n    *   This stereoisomer lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule.\n    *   Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer. These two form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   The question specifies the (2R,3R) isomer, which is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (C3=C4) and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   Carbon C1 is attached to four different groups: -OH, -H, -CH=CH- (the C2-C3 part of the ring), and -CH2-CH2- (the C6-C5 part of the ring). Thus, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The nomenclature `(1s,3s,5s)` typically refers to the all-cis isomer, where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring.\n    *   This highly symmetrical molecule has a C3 axis of rotation and three vertical planes of symmetry (σv).\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are prochiral, not chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. No carbon atom is bonded to four different groups. For instance, C3 of the butane chain is bonded to C2, H, and two identical methyl groups. The cyclopentyl ring carbons are also not chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry. This plane contains the `C=O`, `-CH2-`, `-CH-` and the `H` on the `-CH-` group, and bisects the cyclopentyl ring and the two terminal methyl groups. The existence of a conformation with a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\nTo summarize:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-...-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\n*   **Analysis of Optical Activity**\n    A compound is optically active if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most often caused by the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers). A molecule with stereocenters can still be achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, in which case it is called a meso compound. We will examine each compound for these features.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   Structure: `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In this molecule, there are no such carbon atoms.\n    *   The carbon atoms of the double bond are sp2 hybridized. C3 is bonded to two H atoms. C4 is a methyl group. The methyl on C2 is a methyl group.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond which leads to geometric isomerism (Z/E), but it does not have any chiral centers. The molecule itself is planar. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name itself provides the stereochemistry using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (R/S) notation: `(3aR,7aS)`. This notation is used to define the absolute configuration of specific stereocenters.\n    *   When a specific enantiomer is named (e.g., with R/S descriptors), it is, by definition, chiral and therefore optically active, unless it is a meso compound.\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The designations `3aR` and `7aS` refer to two different stereocenters. For it to be a meso compound, there would have to be an element of symmetry (like a plane) that makes the molecule as a whole superimposable on its mirror image. Given the complex, non-symmetrical name and structure elements (`chloromethylene`, `methanoisobenzofuran` fused system), it is extremely unlikely to possess such symmetry. The name specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer that is not its own mirror image.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The two stereocenters are structurally equivalent (both are `CH(COOH)(CH3)`).\n    *   When a molecule has two equivalent stereocenters with opposite configurations (one R, one S), it is a meso compound. Meso compounds have an internal element of symmetry (a plane or center of inversion in one of its conformations) that makes them achiral overall, despite having stereocenters.\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is the meso isomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. It has a center of inversion in its anti-staggered conformation and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. It has two stereocenters, C2 and C3, both with the R configuration.\n    *   Its mirror image is (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image and lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Therefore, it is chiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   Let's check C1 for chirality. The four groups attached to C1 are: -OH, -H, the ring segment `-CH2-CH=` and the other ring segment `-CH2-CH2-CH=`. These four groups are different. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The specified isomer is the one where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's analyze the symmetry of this molecule. In a chair conformation where all three OH groups are axial (or all are equatorial), the molecule has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (σv).\n    *   Any molecule possessing a plane of symmetry is achiral. Since this isomer is highly symmetric, it is achiral.\n    *   In fact, the carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not true stereocenters in this isomer, because the two paths around the ring from each of these carbons are identical. The use of lowercase `s` often designates prochiral centers in an overall achiral molecule.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   Let's determine the structure from the IUPAC name.\n    *   The parent chain is `butan-1-one`: a four-carbon chain with a ketone `(=O)` at C1.\n    *   Substituents are `1-cyclopentyl` (a cyclopentyl group on C1) and `3-methyl` (a methyl group on C3).\n    *   Assembling the structure: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   This structure can also be called `cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers (carbon with four different groups).\n    *   The carbon at position 3 is `CH`. It is bonded to a `H`, a terminal `CH3` (C4), the `CH3` substituent, and the `-CH2-C(=O)-...` group. The two methyl groups attached to C3 are identical. So, C3 is not a chiral center.\n    *   There are no other sp3 carbons with four different groups in the rest of the molecule. The molecule has no chiral centers and can adopt conformations with a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary**\n\n*   Optically Active:\n    1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n*   Optically Inactive:\n    1.  (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    2.  (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    3.  (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    4.  1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically means the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `CH3-CH2-C(CH3)=CHCl`. A molecule with a double bond is planar in the vicinity of the double bond. This entire molecule is essentially planar and therefore possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a complex molecule, but the name provides the crucial information. The designations `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. When a compound's name includes `(R)` or `(S)` designations, it refers to a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule (unless it's a special case like a *meso* compound with pseudoasymmetric centers). This complex bicyclic structure is not symmetric, so it is not a *meso* compound. A specific enantiomer is, by definition, optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers, C2 and C3. However, the molecule is symmetric, meaning the group on C2 (`-CH(CH3)COOH`) is the same as the group on C3 (`-CH(CH3)COOH`). We need to check if the `(2R,3S)` stereoisomer has an element of symmetry. Due to the opposite configurations at the two chiral centers in a symmetric molecule, this is a *meso* compound. A *meso* compound has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry and is achiral, despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The configurations at the two chiral centers are the same `(R,R)`. This stereoisomer lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` compound. Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. Let's identify any chiral centers. Carbon C1, which bears the -OH group, is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and 4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. Since the two paths around the ring from C1 are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral. The name `(R)-...` specifies a single enantiomer, which is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name refers to the stereoisomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule is highly symmetric. In its stable chair conformation (with all three OH groups in equatorial positions), it possesses a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. We need to search for chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The carbon in the `-CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the molecule. It is not a chiral center.\n    *   None of the CH2 carbons are chiral.\n    *   In the cyclopentyl ring, the carbon attached to the carbonyl group is bonded to the `C=O` group and two identical `-CH2-` groups within the ring (the path `-CH2-CH2-` is the same in both directions). So, no carbon in the ring is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality. It is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n-   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione** (Yes)\n-   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid** (Yes)\n-   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol** (Yes)\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it will exhibit optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic (50:50) mixture of enantiomers. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This usually means the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   **Structure**: Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2, Cl, H attached to C1, C of CH₃, C of CH₂CH₃) lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule (assuming free rotation of the ethyl group or a conformation where one of its H's is in the plane). Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   **Analysis**: The IUPAC name itself provides the crucial information. The prefixes (3aR, 7aS, E) specify a single, distinct stereoisomer. The letters 'R' and 'S' are used to denote the absolute configuration at chiral centers. The existence of a name for a specific enantiomer implies that the molecule is chiral and that this particular form can be isolated. A meso compound (an achiral molecule with chiral centers) would not be named as a single R,S-isomer in this manner without it being clear that the molecule as a whole is achiral. The complexity of the structure, involving a bicyclic system and an exocyclic double bond with specified geometry (E), makes the presence of a symmetry element that would render the entire molecule achiral highly unlikely. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH.\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 (H, CH₃, COOH, and the other half of the molecule) are the same as on C3. When a molecule has two identical chiral centers with opposite configurations (one R, one S), it is a meso compound. A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and is therefore achiral. For (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, there is a center of inversion in its anti-staggered conformation and a plane of symmetry in its eclipsed conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive (it's a meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH.\n    *   **Analysis**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It has two chiral centers with the same configuration (R,R). This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is chiral. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer. Since the specific (2R,3R) enantiomer is given, it is not a racemic mixture.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   **Structure**: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   **Analysis**: The carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the -CH₂-CH= part of the ring, and (4) the -CH₂-CH₂-CH= part of the ring. Since the paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry. The name specifies the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Structure**: A cyclohexane ring with -OH groups at C1, C3, and C5. The notation (1s,3s,5s) usually implies that all three substituents are on the same side of the ring's plane (all-cis configuration).\n    *   **Analysis**: Let's imagine the three -OH groups all pointing \"up\". This molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C₃) and, more importantly, three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one of the C-OH bonds and the carbon atom opposite to it (e.g., the plane containing C1, O, H(on O), C4 and H's on C4). The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   **Structure**: (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl ring).\n    *   **Analysis**: We need to search for a chiral center. None of the carbons in the `3-methylbutanoyl` chain [ (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)- ] are chiral. The carbon in the `CH(CH₃)₂` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups. The carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are also not chiral. For example, the carbon attached to the carbonyl group is bonded to a hydrogen, the carbonyl group, and two identical `-CH₂-` groups within the ring. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains the carbonyl group and bisects the cyclopentyl ring. Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n**Summary**:\n- (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n- (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n- (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n- 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nTo determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to assess whether each molecule is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The common signs of chirality are the presence of a stereocenter (an atom bonded to four different groups) and the absence of any symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Compounds for which a specific enantiomer (e.g., using R/S notation) is named are assumed to be in that enantiomerically pure form, which will be optically active if the molecule is chiral.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule does not have any stereocenters (chiral carbons).\n    *   The plane containing the atoms of the double bond (C=C) and the atoms directly attached to them (`Cl`, `H`, `C` of methyl, `C` of ethyl) is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The IUPAC name specifies the absolute configuration at two stereocenters, `(3aR,7aS)`, and the geometry of a double bond, `(E)`.\n    *   The presence of defined stereocenters in a complex structure like this is a strong indication of chirality.

This molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbon bearing the unique substituent (the 'down' one) and the carbon opposite to it. It is also achiral (a meso compound).\n    *   Since all possible stereoisomers of cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol are achiral, this compound is **optically inactive** regardless of the specific isomer denoted by (1s,3s,5s).\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for any stereocenters.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature that leads to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers), provided the molecule as a whole does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Molecules with stereocenters but possessing such symmetry elements are achiral and are called meso compounds.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond. All atoms involved in and directly attached to the double bond lie in a single plane.

Such a stereoisomer is optically active unless it is a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. This typically occurs when two chemically equivalent stereocenters have opposite configurations (R and S).\n    *   The parent structure, hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione (an adduct from cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride), is a meso compound with a plane of symmetry that relates the two bridgehead carbons (3a and 7a).\n    *   However, the presence of the substituent `(E)-8-(chloromethylene)` breaks this symmetry. The environments of stereocenters 3a and 7a are no longer identical. Therefore, the molecule as a whole loses its plane of symmetry and becomes chiral.\n    *   The given name specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, which is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   It has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are identical to the substituents on C3 (-H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other chiral carbon group).\n    *   The specific configuration (2R, 3S) creates an internal plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond.

Therefore, the four groups attached to C1 are different, and C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The name `(R)-...` specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. It is optically active.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   The descriptors (1s,3s,5s) are non-standard but suggest a `syn` or `cis` arrangement, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring's average plane.\n    *   This all-cis isomer is highly symmetrical. In a chair conformation (either all-axial or all-equatorial OH groups), the molecule has a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and three planes of symmetry (σv).\n    *   Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Result: Not optically active.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   Let's check for any chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH2- group, and two identical methyl groups (`-CH3`). Since it's bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter.\n    *   No other carbon in the chain or in the cyclopentyl ring is a stereocenter. The molecule does not possess any other elements of chirality (e.g., axial or planar chirality).\n    *   The molecule has freely rotating bonds and can adopt conformations that possess a plane of symmetry.

This typically occurs when a molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (usually a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(CH₃)=CH-Cl.\n    *   The double bond (C=C) makes this part of the molecule planar.

The name itself provides definitive stereochemical information: (3aR, 7aS, E).\n    *   The descriptors (3aR, 7aS) specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters. This indicates that we are dealing with a single stereoisomer.\n    *   For this molecule to be achiral, it would have to be a meso compound, which requires an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   The parent skeleton might possess symmetry, but the substituent \"chloromethylene\" (=CHCl) is itself unsymmetrical (H vs. Cl). The \"E\" designation fixes the geometry.\n    *   The presence of an unsymmetrical substituent on a complex scaffold, combined with the specific (R,S) descriptors for the stereocenters, makes it overwhelmingly likely that the molecule as a whole lacks any internal symmetry.\n    *   A single, specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups). However, the ultimate test is to look for elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i). If a molecule possesses either of these, it is achiral and thus optically inactive. A molecule that has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to a plane of symmetry or center of inversion is called a meso compound.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms of the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H on C1; C(methyl), C(ethyl) on C2) lie in a single plane.\n    *   There are no chiral centers in this molecule.\n    *   The plane containing the double bond and its substituents is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   This is a very complex name, but we can deduce its activity from the name itself.\n    *   The name includes absolute configuration descriptors: `(3aR,7aS)` for two stereocenters and `(E)` for a double bond.\n    *   The explicit designation of a single stereoisomer with specific absolute configurations (R/S) implies that the molecule is chiral and the name refers to one of the enantiomers.\n    *   An exception would be if this were a meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall. For example, `(2R,3S)-tartaric acid` is meso. This usually happens when the stereocenters are constitutionally equivalent and have opposite configurations. Here, C3a and C7a are the fusion carbons of an anhydride ring to a bicyclic system (`hexahydro-4,7-methano`), making them constitutionally equivalent in the parent dione. The `(3aR,7aS)` configuration would indeed make the parent dione a meso compound.\n    *   However, there is an additional substituent: `(E)-8-(chloromethylene)`, which is an `=CHCl` group at position 8 (the methano bridge carbon). This substituent lies on the plane of symmetry of the parent dione, but the substituent itself is not symmetric with respect to that plane. Adding this asymmetric substituent destroys the plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the entire molecule is chiral. The given name specifies one of its enantiomers. It is optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   It has two chiral centers, C2 and C3.\n    *   The designated stereoisomer is `(2R,3S)`. When a molecule has two constitutionally identical chiral centers, the `(R,S)` diastereomer (or `(S,R)`) is a meso compound.\n    *   We can draw a Newman projection or Fischer projection to confirm. A plane of symmetry exists between C2 and C3.\n    *   Since it is a meso compound, it is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The designated stereoisomer is `(2R,3R)`. This isomer is chiral. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable (they are an enantiomeric pair).\n    *   This compound has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, it is chiral and optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the ring segment `-CH2-CH=` (path towards C2), and 4) the ring segment `-CH2-CH2-CH=` (path towards C6). Since the paths around the ring from C1 are different, the four groups are different, making C1 a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry.\n    *   The name `(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol` specifies one of the two enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, it is chiral and optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This name describes a stereoisomer of cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. The `1s,3s,5s` notation, though less common than R/S, specifies a relative configuration where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's analyze the symmetry of the all-cis isomer. In a chair conformation, this molecule would exist as an equilibrium between a tri-axial form and a tri-equatorial form.\n    *   Considering a planar representation or either chair conformer, the molecule possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3), but it lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Molecules belonging to the C_n point group (for n > 1) are chiral.\n    *   Therefore, all-cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol is a chiral molecule, existing as a pair of enantiomers. The name specifies one of them. It is optically **active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. There are none. The carbon in the -CH(CH3)2 group is attached to two identical methyl groups. All carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are attached to two hydrogens or are part of a symmetrical ring relative to the point of attachment.\n    *   Let's check for a plane of symmetry. The molecule can adopt a conformation where a plane of symmetry passes through the cyclopentyl carbon attached to the carbonyl group, the carbonyl group itself, the adjacent CH2, and the CH of the isopropyl group, bisecting the cyclopentyl ring and the two methyl groups of the isopropyl group.\n    *   Since a conformer with a plane of symmetry exists and is readily accessible, the molecule is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: **Inactive**\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Inactive**\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: **Active**\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: **Inactive**\n\nThere are 4 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the optical activity of each compound. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the absence of a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   **Structure**: `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   **Analysis**: This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, CH3, C from ethyl) lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a complex, bridged polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   **Analysis**: The designation `(3aR,7aS...)` indicates that the compound is a specific stereoisomer with defined configurations at its chiral centers (3a and 7a). When a compound is named as a single stereoisomer (with R/S descriptors), it is chiral unless it is a meso compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral due to internal symmetry. However, this molecule has a substituent, `(E)-8-(chloromethylene)` which is `-C=CHCl`, on the methano bridge. This substituent is unsymmetrical and is placed on the bridge, which destroys any potential plane of symmetry that might have existed in the parent bicyclic framework. Therefore, the molecule as a whole is asymmetric.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral, and thus **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis**: This is a classic example of a meso compound. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule that has a plane of symmetry when viewed in an eclipsed conformation (in a Fischer projection) or a center of inversion in its staggered anti-periplanar conformation. The optical rotation caused by the (2R) center is cancelled internally by the opposite rotation caused by the (3S) center.\n        ```\n           COOH\n            |\n        H---C(R)---CH3\n        ----------- (plane of symmetry)\n      CH3---C(S)---H\n            |\n           COOH\n        ```\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral (meso), and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This is a diastereomer of the compound above.\n    *   **Analysis**: The `(2R,3R)` configuration does not have any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. The molecule is chiral, and its mirror image is the non-superimposable (2S,3S) isomer. These two form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral, and thus **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   **Structure**: A six-membered ring with a double bond (C3-C4) and a hydroxyl group (at C1).\n    *   **Analysis**: The name explicitly designates it as the (R) enantiomer. Carbon C1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH2-CH=, and -CH=CH-CH2-. The designation `(R)` specifies one of the two enantiomers, which is by definition chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral, and thus **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Structure**: Cyclohexane with three OH groups at C1, C3, and C5, all on the same side of the ring (cis).\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule is highly symmetrical. In its stable chair conformation with all three OH groups in equatorial positions, the molecule possesses a C3 axis of rotation and three planes of symmetry (each plane passes through a C-OH group). The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. The `s` notation (instead of R/S) is often used to denote stereogenic centers in an achiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral, and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   **Structure**: `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Analysis**: Let's search for chiral centers (a carbon with four different groups). There are none. The carbon in the `-CH(CH3)2` group is attached to two identical methyl groups. While lack of a chiral center doesn't automatically mean achiral, this molecule does possess a plane of symmetry in an accessible conformation. This plane contains the ketone's C=O group, the CH2 group, and the CH of the isopropyl group, and it bisects both the cyclopentyl ring and the two methyls of the isopropyl group.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral, and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary**:\n\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are three compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if and only if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). However, molecules can be achiral even with stereocenters if they possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion (these are called meso compounds).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond. The atoms directly involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms attached to them (Cl, H, CH3, and the first C of the ethyl group) all lie in the same plane.\n    *   A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex molecule with a rigid, bicyclic structure.\n    *   The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors: `(3aR,7aS)` and `(E)`.\n    *   The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the configuration at two stereocenters. While a molecule with multiple stereocenters can be meso (achiral), this is unlikely for such a complex and asymmetric structure. Meso compounds typically have a more symmetric substitution pattern (e.g., compound 3).\n    *   The parent structure, `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione`, can be achiral (meso). However, the substituent `8-(chloromethylene)` (a `>C=CHCl` group), attached to the framework, breaks this potential symmetry.\n    *   In general, when an IUPAC name provides specific `R/S` designations for a complex molecule, it refers to a single enantiomer of a chiral compound.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   It has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule where one half is the mirror image of the other half. There is an internal plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond.\n    *   This is a classic example of a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound.\n    *   In the `(2R,3R)` isomer, the molecule no longer has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   It is a chiral molecule, and it has an enantiomer, the `(2S,3S)` isomer.\n    *   Since it is a chiral molecule, it will be optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.\n    *   Let's check C1 for chirality. The four groups attached to C1 are: -OH, -H, the ring segment `-CH2-CH=`, and the other ring segment `-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-`.\n    *   Tracing the paths around the ring from C1, they are different: one path encounters the double bond at C3, the other encounters it at C4 (after passing through C5 and C6). Thus, the two ring connections are different groups.\n    *   Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter. A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral. The name `(R)` specifies one of the two enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This name describes the all-cis isomer of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring.\n    *   The molecule exists in two rapidly interconverting chair conformations (one with all -OH groups axial, the other with all -OH groups equatorial).\n    *   Both of these individual chair conformations are chiral (they possess a C3 axis of symmetry but no mirror plane).\n    *   However, the molecule can pass through an achiral boat conformation during the ring-flipping process. This boat conformation has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Because the two enantiomeric chair conformers can easily interconvert via an achiral intermediate conformation, the compound cannot be resolved into separate enantiomers and is considered achiral overall (functionally meso). It will not exhibit optical activity.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   Based on IUPAC conventions, the structure is cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone: `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-[cyclopentyl ring]`.\n    *   Let's check for any stereocenters. The carbon in the `(CH3)2CH` group is attached to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter. There are no other stereocenters in the chain or the unsubstituted cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters.\n    *   Furthermore, it's possible to find a conformation of this molecule that possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane would pass through the carbonyl group and bisect the cyclopentyl ring and the isobutyl group.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n**Summary**:\n*   Active: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   Active: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   Active: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of one or more stereocenters and the overall lack of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   Structure: Cl-CH=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n    *   This is an alkene. To check for chirality, we first look for stereocenters (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). There are no sp³ hybridized carbons with four different substituents, so there are no stereocenters.\n    *   Molecules without stereocenters can sometimes be chiral (e.g., allenes, atropisomers), but this simple alkene does not fall into those categories.\n    *   The molecule has a plane containing the atoms of the double bond (C1 and C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, the carbon of the methyl group, and the first carbon of the ethyl group). While the entire molecule is not perfectly planar due to the sp³ carbons in the ethyl group, it possesses a conformation with a plane of symmetry that encompasses the Cl, C1, H, C2, and the C-C-C skeleton of the butyl part. Any molecule that can adopt a conformation with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: The compound is **achiral** and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The IUPAC name itself provides the answer. The descriptors (3aR, 7aS) specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters, C-3a and C-7a. The (E) describes the geometry of the double bond in the chloromethylene (=CHCl) group.\n    *   Naming a compound with specific R/S descriptors for its stereocenters indicates that the compound is chiral and this name refers to a single, specific enantiomer (or diastereomer). A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active by definition.\n    *   Although some molecules with R and S stereocenters can be achiral (meso compounds), this only occurs if the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. In this complex bicyclic molecule, the two stereocenters, C-3a and C-7a, are in chemically different environments (one is part of an anhydride ring adjacent to two carbonyls, the other is adjacent to a furan-like oxygen). The molecule is inherently asymmetric, and the additional substituent at position 8 further ensures the lack of symmetry.\n    *   Conclusion: The compound is **chiral**, and as a specific stereoisomer is given, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   Structure: HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are H, CH₃, COOH, and the -CH(CH₃)COOH group. The substituents on C3 are also H, CH₃, COOH, and the other chiral group. The two stereocenters are constitutionally equivalent.\n    *   This allows for the existence of a meso-compound. The (2R,3S) isomer is indeed the meso form. It has a center of inversion in its stable anti-periplanar conformation, which makes it achiral. In a Fischer projection (eclipsed conformation), it shows a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Conclusion: This is a **meso compound**, which is **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   The (2R,3R) isomer lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is non-superimposable on its mirror image, (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   Conclusion: The compound is **chiral** and, as a single enantiomer, is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The name specifies the (R) configuration, indicating it is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound.\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is a stereocenter. The four different groups attached to it are: -OH, -H, the ring segment -CH₂-CH=, and the other ring segment -CH₂-CH₂-. The two paths around the ring are different because one immediately encounters the double bond.\n    *   The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Conclusion: The compound is **chiral** and, as the (R)-enantiomer, is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. There are two possible stereoisomers (diastereomers).\n    *   Isomer 1: All three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis). This molecule has a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and three planes of symmetry (σᵥ). Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the opposite C-H on the other side of the ring. Due to the planes of symmetry, this isomer is achiral.\n    *   Isomer 2: Two -OH groups are on one side (cis) and the third is on the other side (trans). This molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the \"trans\" hydroxyl group and bisects the ring. This isomer is also achiral.\n    *   Since all possible stereoisomers of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol are achiral, the specific compound named must be achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: The compound is **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   Let's determine the structure from the IUPAC name.\n        *   Parent chain: \"butan-1-one\" indicates a four-carbon chain with a ketone functional group at carbon 1.

Since C3 is attached to two identical methyl groups, it is not a stereocenter.\n    *   There are no other stereocenters in the molecule, nor does it possess axial or planar chirality.\n    *   Conclusion: The compound is **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds among the seven listed.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers).

A meso compound must have internal symmetry. While the core structure might possess symmetry, the combination of multiple stereocenters (`3aR,7aS`) and an unsymmetrically placed substituent (`(E)-8-(chloromethylene)`) makes it extremely unlikely for the molecule as a whole to possess a plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.

For example, C3 of the butanoyl chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups.\n    *   The molecule also has no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). It can adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry. This plane would contain the C=O group and can be aligned with symmetry planes within the isobutyl and cyclopentyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically active: #2, #4, #5\n*   Not optically active: #1, #3, #6, #7\n\nThere are **3** optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nAn optically active compound is a chiral compound that can rotate the plane of polarized light.

These two pathways around the ring are different. Thus, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor `(1s,3s,5s)` implies that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's consider the chair conformation.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks any improper axis of rotation (Sn), which includes planes of symmetry (σ, which is S1) and centers of inversion (i, which is S2).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure**: Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule does not have a chiral center (a carbon atom with four different substituents). While the double bond has a specific (Z) geometry, the molecule as a whole is achiral. It possesses a plane of symmetry in at least one of its conformations (considering the freely rotating ethyl group), and its mirror image is superimposable on the original. For example, reflection across the plane of the molecule followed by a 180° rotation around an axis perpendicular to the plane results in the original molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral, thus optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   **Analysis**: The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` indicate the presence of chiral centers with a specific absolute configuration. The `(E)` descriptor defines the stereochemistry of an exocyclic double bond. A molecule given as a specific enantiomer (with R/S descriptors) is, by definition, chiral unless it happens to be a meso compound. The complex and asymmetric nature of the molecule, particularly with the addition of an asymmetric substituent (`=CH-Cl`), makes it virtually certain that there is no internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral, thus optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure**: HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). The substituents on both centers are identical (H, CH₃, COOH). The stereochemical configuration is `(2R,3S)`. When a molecule has multiple stereocenters with identical substitution patterns and an R,S configuration (or S,R), it is a meso compound. Meso compounds have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion that makes them achiral despite having chiral centers. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3 when viewed in its eclipsed conformation (and in its Fischer projection).\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral (meso), thus optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure**: HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis**: This is a diastereomer of the compound above. It has the configuration `(2R,3R)`. This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral, thus optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure**: A six-membered ring with a C=C double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group on C1.\n    *   **Analysis**: The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the ring segment `-CH₂-CH=`, and 4) the ring segment `-CH₂-CH₂-CH=`. Because the paths around the ring from C1 are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule is named with the `(R)` descriptor, indicating it is a specific enantiomer. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral, thus optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure**: A cyclohexane ring with -OH groups at C1, C3, and C5. The `1s,3s,5s` notation implies that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule, with its high symmetry, is achiral. It has no chiral centers because the two paths around the ring from any of the substituted carbons (C1, C3, or C5) are identical. The molecule as a whole possesses several symmetry elements, including a C₃ axis of rotation and three vertical planes of symmetry (σᵥ), each passing through a C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bond. The presence of these planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral, thus optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure**: (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-cyclopentyl\n    *   **Analysis**: We examine the molecule for chiral centers. The carbon atom `CH(CH₃)₂` is attached to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. No carbon atom in the cyclopentyl ring is chiral either. The molecule as a whole is achiral because it can adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry. This plane contains the C=O group, the CH₂ group, the CH group, and bisects the two methyl groups as well as the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral, thus optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically active (chiral) compounds:\n    *   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    *   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Optically inactive (achiral) compounds:\n    *   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    *   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

    "**Analysis of each compound for optical activity:**\n\nAn optically active compound must be chiral, meaning its structure is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key test for chirality is the absence of any improper axis of rotation (Sₙ), which includes a plane of symmetry (σ, which is S₁) and a center of inversion (i, which is S₂).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`. The molecule is planar around the C=C double bond. A plane containing the C=C bond and its substituents acts as a plane of symmetry. Since it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`, indicating specific absolute configurations at two chiral centers. A name that specifies a single stereoisomer implies that it is one of a pair of enantiomers. Unless the molecule is a *meso* compound (achiral despite having stereocenters), it is chiral. This complex molecule lacks the internal symmetry required to be meso, especially with the asymmetric `=CHCl` substituent on the bridge. Therefore, it is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound and is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3. However, the substituents on C2 are the same as on C3. For such a molecule, the (R,S) stereoisomer is a meso compound. It possesses an internal center of inversion (or a plane of symmetry in certain conformations) that makes it achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso form. The `(2R,3R)` isomer lacks any internal symmetry. It is chiral, and its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` isomer. As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: `-H`, `-OH`, the path around the ring towards the double bond (`-CH2-CH=`), and the path around the ring away from the double bond (`-CH2-CH2-CH=`). The name `(R)-...` specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis). This molecule is highly symmetric. It possesses three planes of symmetry (each passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite carbon atom). A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. A check for chiral centers reveals none. The carbon in the `CH(CH3)2` group is attached to two identical methyl groups, making it achiral. The molecule has no other elements of chirality and possesses accessible conformations with a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione (**Active**)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (**Active**)\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol (**Active**)\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds. This corresponds to option D. A review of the candidate answers shows that while the majority correctly analyze the chemistry to arrive at a count of 3, they are inconsistent in selecting the final letter option.

A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral carbons).

In a staggered conformation, if we place the COOH groups anti-periplanar, the H on C2 is opposite the CH3 on C3, and the CH3 on C2 is opposite the H on C3. This conformation has a center of inversion. In an eclipsed conformation, the molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond.\n    *   A compound with stereocenters but which is achiral due to a plane of symmetry or center of inversion is a **meso compound**.\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a classic example of a meso compound.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.

Let's analyze each compound to determine its chirality and thus its potential for optical activity.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   To be chiral, a molecule must lack an internal plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   This molecule has a double bond. The atoms connected to the double bond (Cl, H, C(CH3), C(CH2CH3)) lie in the same plane.\n    *   This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name of this compound includes stereochemical descriptors for absolute configuration: `(3aR, 7aS)`.\n    *   The designation of R and S configurations specifies a particular stereoisomer. When a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule is named, it is by definition chiral.\n    *   A sample consisting of a single enantiomer is optically active.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 (H, CH3, COOH, -CH(CH3)COOH) are identical to the substituents on C3.\n    *   The configuration is given as (2R, 3S), meaning the two stereocenters have opposite configurations.\n    *   A compound with multiple stereocenters that is achiral is called a meso compound. This typically occurs when the stereocenters have opposite configurations (one R, one S) and have identical sets of substituents.\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has a center of inversion and is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The configuration is (2R, 3R), meaning both stereocenters have the same configuration.\n    *   This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral.\n    *   Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) isomer, which is non-superimposable. These two form a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The name specifies the absolute configuration `(R)` at one of the carbons (C1).\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and the `-CH=CH-CH2-` part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule is chiral. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   This molecule is conformationally flexible. Its most stable conformations are two interconverting chairs. Both of these chair conformations are chiral (they belong to the C3 point group).\n    *   However, a molecule is considered achiral if it can easily access any achiral conformation. The process of ring-flipping in cyclohexane passes through higher-energy boat and twist-boat conformations. For the all-cis-1,3,5-triol, there exists an accessible boat conformation that possesses a plane of symmetry (a C_s point group).\n    *   Because the molecule can readily pass through an achiral conformation, the chiral conformers rapidly interconvert, resulting in a racemic mixture that cannot be resolved. Thus, the compound as a whole is considered achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to a carbonyl, which is then attached to an isobutyl group: `(C5H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for stereocenters. There are none. All carbons are bonded to at least two identical groups (e.g., two H's on a CH2, or two CH3's on the CH).\n    *   The molecule is flexible due to single bond rotation. It is possible to find a conformation that has a plane of symmetry. This plane would contain the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisect both the cyclopentyl ring and the isobutyl group.\n    *   Since the molecule has no stereocenters and has accessible conformations with a plane of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and present in a non-racemic form. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. However, a molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it is a meso compound (possessing an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms bonded to the sp2 carbons (Cl, H, C, C) lie in the same plane. The molecule is planar.\n    *   Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself provides the key information. The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` indicate the presence of specific stereocenters with a defined absolute configuration. The `(E)` describes the geometry of the exocyclic double bond.\n    *   This designates a single, specific stereoisomer. A specific stereoisomer is always optically active unless it happens to be a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound must possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The structure is complex and unsymmetrical, particularly due to the `(E)-chloromethylene` group (`=CHCl`). This substituent breaks any potential symmetry that the parent bicyclic framework might have.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is chiral and, as a specific stereoisomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are identical to the substituents on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group).\n    *   For a molecule with two identical stereocenters, the isomer with the (R,S) or (S,R) configuration is the meso form.\n    *   The meso form has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond. Because it is superimposable on its mirror image, it is achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. It is the (R,R) diastereomer.\n    *   This isomer does not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, and they are not superimposable.\n    *   The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers form an enantiomeric pair. As a single enantiomer is specified, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   This is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and an alcohol group (at C1).\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) -CH2-CH=CH- (path towards C2), and (4) -CH2-CH2-CH= (path towards C6). The two paths around the ring are different due to the asymmetric position of the double bond relative to C1.\n    *   Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter. The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Thus, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This name describes the isomer where the three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's consider the chair conformation. The most stable conformation would have all three bulky -OH groups in equatorial positions. However, even the less stable tri-axial conformation can be considered.\n    *   In the tri-axial conformation, the molecule possesses a C3 axis of rotation and, more importantly, three vertical planes of symmetry (σv). Each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the CH2 group opposite to it.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Although the molecule has conformational isomers, the overall time-averaged molecule is achiral because the symmetric conformers are accessible.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We need to check for any stereocenters (a carbon with four different substituents).\n    *   The `CH(CH3)2` carbon is bonded to H, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the molecule; it is not a stereocenter.\n    *   All other carbons are either sp2 hybridized (C=O) or are CH2 groups, so there are no stereocenters in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule also possesses a plane of symmetry in its most stable conformation (this plane contains the carbonyl group and bisects the cyclopentyl ring and the isobutyl group).\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, it is **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   **Active**: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   **Active**: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Active**: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   **Inactive**: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n*   **Inactive**: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Inactive**: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n*   **Inactive**: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and present in a form that is not a racemic mixture.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** ClHC=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1 and C2) and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. The entire molecule is essentially planar. A molecule with a plane of symmetry (in this case, the molecular plane itself) is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides crucial information.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereochemical descriptors (3a**R**, 7a**S**, **E**) specify a single, unique stereoisomer. The presence of R/S descriptors indicates that there are chiral centers in the molecule. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active. This molecule is highly asymmetric and is not a meso compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. However, the molecule has a symmetric structure (the two ends are identical -COOH groups). The (2R, 3S) configuration results in a meso compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. We can see this by drawing its Fischer projection, which has a center of inversion, making it superimposable on its mirror image.\n          COOH\n           |\n      CH₃--|--H   (R)\n           |\n      H----|--CH₃ (S)\n           |\n          COOH\n    *   This molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral (meso compound) and optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound described above. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. They are chiral and non-superimposable on their mirror images. The name specifies a single enantiomer, (2R,3R).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral and optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** The carbon atom C1 is a stereocenter. It is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the ring segment -CH₂-CH=, and 4) the ring segment -CH₂-CH₂-. Since the two paths around the ring from C1 are different, C1 is a stereocenter. The name specifies the (R) configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The notation (1s,3s,5s) implies that all three -OH groups have the same relative orientation (i.e., they are all cis to each other).\n    *   **Analysis:** This all-cis isomer is highly symmetrical. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C₃) and three planes of symmetry (σᵥ). For example, a plane of symmetry passes through the C1-O bond and the C4 atom. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (CH₃)₂CHCH₂C(=O)-cyclopentyl\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to check for any chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two methyl groups (one is C4, the other is the substituent), and the -CH₂C(=O)-cyclopentyl group. Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. No other atom in the molecule is a chiral center. The molecule can adopt conformations that possess a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral and optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically active compounds:\n    1.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This is typically due to the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of any internal elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`. The molecule contains a double bond. All atoms connected to the double bond (Cl, H, C of CH3, C of CH2CH3) lie in the same plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors (R, S, E). The \"(3aR,7aS)\" part indicates that there are chiral centers at positions 3a and 7a, and a specific spatial arrangement is defined. A compound for which a specific enantiomer (like R or S) is named is, by definition, chiral and optically active (unless it's a meso compound, which is not the case for this complex structure).\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. The descriptors are (2R, 3S). Let's examine its structure. This specific combination of R and S configurations results in a molecule with a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond. Such a compound, which has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to internal symmetry, is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are optically inactive.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The stereochemistry is (2R, 3R). This molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral, and its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) enantiomer. As a chiral molecule, it is optically active.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. The carbon atom C1, bonded to the -OH group, is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH=CH- (part of the ring), and -CH2-CH2- (the other part of the ring). The name specifies the (R) enantiomer. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The 's' notation, in this context, usually implies a 'cis' relationship between the substituents. So, this is the all-cis isomer, with all three hydroxyl groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. If you consider the more stable chair conformation where all three -OH groups are equatorial, the molecule has three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl ring)`.

This is typically due to the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of any internal planes of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃CH₂C(CH₃)=CHCl.\n    *   This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. The entire molecule is planar.\n    *   Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself).\n    *   Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself provides the absolute configuration of two stereocenters, (3aR, 7aS), and the geometry of a double bond, (E).\n    *   The designation of specific R/S configurations indicates that this is a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   Complex bridged molecules like this are generally chiral unless they possess a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   Since a single enantiomer (or diastereomer) is specified by the name, it must be a chiral compound. Chiral compounds are **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule is symmetrical, as the two ends (COOH) and the substituents on the chiral carbons (H, CH₃) are the same.\n    *   When a molecule has two chiral centers and symmetrical ends, the (R,S) configuration results in a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound has a plane of symmetry (when viewed in an eclipsed conformation like a Fischer projection) or a center of inversion (in a staggered conformation). Due to this internal symmetry, it is achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound.\n    *   The configuration is (2R, 3R). Its mirror image would be (2S, 3S).\n    *   This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and a hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) -CH=CH-CH₂- (path C2-C3-C4), and 4) -CH₂-CH₂-CH= (path C6-C5-C4). The two pathways around the ring from C1 are different. Thus, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This represents the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's consider the chair conformation. All three -OH groups can be axial, or they can all be equatorial. In either case, the molecule has a C₃ axis of rotation (a 120° rotation around an axis through the center of the ring restores the molecule).\n    *   However, the molecule does not have any plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Molecules that possess a rotational axis (Cn) but lack a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i) are chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-[cyclopentyl ring].\n    *   We need to check for any elements of chirality. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbon in the -CH(CH₃)₂ group is attached to two identical methyl groups. All carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are -CH₂- groups.\n    *   The molecule can adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry. This plane would contain the C=O group and the adjacent CH₂ and C atoms, bisecting the two methyl groups and the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   Since a conformation with a plane of symmetry is readily accessible, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary**:\n*   Optically Inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.\n*   Optically Active: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol.\n\nThere are 4 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally means the molecule lacks any improper axis of rotation, which includes planes of symmetry (σ) and centers of inversion (i). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond. All four atoms connected to the C=C double bond lie in the same plane.\n    *   A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself).\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   The descriptors (3aR, 7aS) specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (C-3a and C-7a).\n    *   When a compound is named with specific R/S descriptors, it refers to a single stereoisomer. Unless this specific stereoisomer happens to be a meso compound (an achiral molecule with stereocenters), it will be chiral.\n    *   The parent structure might have some symmetry, but the substituents, especially the `=(E)-CHCl` group on the methano-bridge, make the overall molecule asymmetric. It does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, this specific enantiomer is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH).\n    *   The (2R,3S) configuration indicates that the two stereocenters have opposite configurations. For a molecule with two identical stereocenters, the (R,S) or (S,R) form is a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound has a plane of symmetry (when in an eclipsed conformation) or a center of inversion (when in a staggered, anti-periplanar conformation). Due to this internal symmetry, it is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The configuration is (2R,3R).\n    *   This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, and they are non-superimposable.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically active. (It would be found as one of a pair of enantiomers).\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (C3=C4) and a hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   The carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the `-CH2-CH=` path around the ring, and (4) the `-CH=CH-CH2-` path around the ring. Since these two paths are different, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) enantiomer. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, it is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is cyclohexane with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptors (1s,3s,5s) indicate that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all *cis*).\n    *   Let's visualize the molecule with all three -OH groups pointing \"up\". This molecule has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3). More importantly, it has three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the C-H group on the opposite carbon (e.g., a plane through C1 and C4).\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral** (it's a meso compound). Therefore, it is not optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The IUPAC name describes a ketone where the carbonyl group is flanked by a cyclopentyl group and a 3-methylbutyl group.\n    *   The structure is `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for any stereocenters. A stereocenter is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a stereocenter.\n    *   There are no other stereocenters in the molecule. The cyclopentyl ring has a plane of symmetry passing through the carbon attached to the carbonyl group.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters and is **achiral**. It is not optically active.\n\nSummary of optically active compounds:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nAn optically active compound is a chiral compound, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters, but this is not a guarantee, as molecules with multiple stereocenters can be achiral if they possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion (these are called meso compounds). A compound named with a specific stereochemical descriptor like (R) or (S) is a single enantiomer and is therefore optically active, unless it is a meso compound.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `CH3CH2(CH3)C=CHCl`.\n    *   This molecule contains a C=C double bond, but no chiral centers (a chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane containing the atoms of the double bond).\n    *   Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex, polycyclic molecule.\n    *   The name itself provides the crucial information. It specifies the absolute configuration at two stereocenters, C-3a as (R) and C-7a as (S), and the geometry of a double bond as (E).\n    *   Naming a specific stereoisomer with (R) and (S) designations implies that the molecule is chiral and that this is one of its enantiomers. It is highly unlikely that a molecule with such a complex and asymmetric structure would be meso.\n    *   Therefore, it is a single enantiomer and is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule has a symmetric structure (the two ends are identical -COOH groups).\n    *   The (2R,3S) stereoisomer has the two methyl groups on opposite sides in a Fischer projection and possesses a center of inversion. This makes it a meso compound.\n    *   Meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers are enantiomers of each other. They do not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   This is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group.\n    *   The carbon atom bonded to the -OH group (C1) is attached to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH2-CH=CH-, and -CH2-CH2-CH=. The two paths around the ring from C1 are different due to the location of the double bond.\n    *   Therefore, C1 is a chiral center, and the molecule is chiral.\n    *   The name (R)-... specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This molecule has a highly symmetrical 1,3,5-substitution pattern on a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   There are two possible diastereomers: one where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis), and one where two are on one side and one is on the other (cis,trans).\n    *   Due to the high symmetry, both of these diastereomers possess a plane of symmetry.\n    *   The all-cis isomer has a C3 axis and three planes of symmetry. It is achiral.\n    *   The cis,trans isomer has a plane of symmetry passing through the \"unique\" hydroxyl group and the carbon opposite to it. It is also achiral.\n    *   Since all possible stereoisomers of this compound are achiral (meso), it is **optically inactive**, regardless of the specific stereochemistry implied by \"(1s,3s,5s)\".\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl)`.\n    *   Let's check for any chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. No other carbon is bonded to four different groups.\n    *   The molecule does not have any chiral centers and is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   Optically active:\n    1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n*   Optically inactive:\n    1.

A compound is optically active if and only if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

The atoms of the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, the carbon of the methyl group, the first carbon of the ethyl group) all lie in the same plane. Essentially, the entire molecule is planar. A planar molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The core is a norbornane-like system.\n    *   **Analysis:** The IUPAC name itself provides the crucial information. The prefixes `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers (the bridgehead carbons 3a and 7a). The designation of a specific enantiomer with (R) and (S) configurations implies that the molecule is chiral. If it were an achiral meso compound, it would not be named as a single (R,S) enantiomer in this manner. The molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. The configuration is given as (2R, 3S), meaning the two stereocenters have opposite configurations. In molecules with two stereocenters and identical substituents on both centers (like this one), the (R,S) isomer is a meso compound. A meso compound has a center of symmetry or a plane of symmetry in at least one of its conformations. For (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, the staggered conformation possesses a center of inversion, and the eclipsed conformation has a plane of symmetry. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the compound above. It has two stereocenters with the same configuration, (2R, 3R). This molecule does not have any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which is the (2S, 3S) isomer. Therefore, it is a chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to check for chiral centers. Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -H, (2) -OH, (3) -CH2-CH= (path towards C2), and (4) -CH2-CH2-CH= (path towards C6). Since the two paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. The name also specifies the (R) configuration, indicating it is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor `(1s,3s,5s)` implies that the three substituents are on the same side of the ring (all *cis*).\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's consider the chair conformation. In the all-*cis* isomer, the three -OH groups can be either all axial or all equatorial. In both cases, the molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite C-H bond on the ring. The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral, even though carbons C1, C3, and C5 are stereocenters. This is a meso compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2`\n    *   **Analysis:** We must check for any chiral centers. The cyclopentyl ring has only -CH2- groups. The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized. The chain is an isobutyl group attached to a methylene: -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2. The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH2- group, and two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The molecule also lacks any other element of chirality like axial or planar chirality. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n### Summary\n\nLet's tally the results:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine if a compound exhibits optical activity, we need to assess whether it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually means the molecule lacks any improper axis of rotation, which includes a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H on C1; C(methyl), C(ethyl) on C2) lie in the same plane. The molecule has a plane of symmetry which is the plane of the molecule itself. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral, optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The core `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione` is a saturated derivative related to the Diels-Alder adduct of furan and maleic anhydride. This parent core structure is a meso compound; it has stereocenters (3a and 7a) but possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereocenters are designated (3aR, 7aS), which is characteristic of a meso compound. However, there is a substituent on the methano bridge (C8): `8-(chloromethylene)`, which is an =CHCl group. The plane of symmetry in the parent molecule passes through this C8 bridge atom. The substituent =CHCl is not symmetric (H ≠ Cl). Therefore, the introduction of this group destroys the plane of symmetry of the parent molecule. The resulting molecule is chiral. The name `(3aR,7aS,E)-...` specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral compound. Single enantiomers are optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral, optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH₃, COOH, and the other -CH(CH₃)COOH group). When the two stereocenters in such a molecule have opposite configurations (one R, one S), the compound is a meso form. A meso compound has a plane of symmetry (in its eclipsed conformation) or a center of inversion (in its staggered conformation). Due to this internal symmetry, it is achiral despite having stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral (meso), optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The stereocenters have the same configuration (both R). This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It has a non-superimposable mirror image, which is the (2S,3S) isomer. These two form a pair of enantiomers. As a single enantiomer, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral, optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group on C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name specifies the (R) configuration, which indicates we are dealing with a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The carbon atom C1 is a stereocenter because the four groups attached to it are different: -OH, -H, the path -CH₂-CH=CH- (from C2 to C3), and the path -CH₂-CH₂-CH= (from C6 to C5). The molecule lacks any element of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral, optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with -OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation implies that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's visualize the molecule with all three -OH groups pointing \"up\". This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a three-fold axis of rotation (C₃) perpendicular to the ring. More importantly, it has three vertical planes of symmetry (σᵥ). Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the opposite C-H bond. The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral, optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to look for any source of chirality. There are no stereocenters in the molecule. The carbon in the CH(CH₃)₂ group is bonded to two identical methyl groups. All other sp³ carbons are CH₂ groups or part of the symmetric cyclopentyl ring system connected to the carbonyl. The molecule is flexible due to rotation around single bonds, and it can adopt conformations that have a plane of symmetry. For instance, a plane can contain the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisect both the cyclopentyl ring and the isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]. Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral, optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Optically active (chiral) compounds:\n    - (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    - (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    - (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n- Optically inactive (achiral) compounds:\n    - (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    - (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    - (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    - 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nA molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key feature to look for is the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C of methyl, C of ethyl) lie in the same plane.\n    *   This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   Since it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)`. This specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer.\n    *   A specific stereoisomer is, by definition, a pure enantiomer or a diastereomer.\n    *   Unless the molecule is a meso compound (having chiral centers but being achiral overall due to internal symmetry), a single stereoisomer is chiral and optically active.\n    *   The complex, multi-ring structure with an `(E)-chloromethylene` (`=CHCl`) substituent makes it highly unlikely for the molecule to possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The `R` and `S` designations at the chiral centers (3a and 7a) confirm the presence of chirality. The specific configuration `(3aR,7aS)` combined with the `(E)` double bond represents a single chiral molecule.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   Let's examine the symmetry of the `(2R,3S)` stereoisomer. This particular combination of stereocenters creates a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound has chiral centers, but it is achiral overall because it possesses an internal element of symmetry.\n    *   In the case of (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, there is a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C2-C3 bond.\n    *   Due to this center of inversion, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. The stereochemistry is `(2R,3R)`.\n    *   This molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` stereoisomer, and they are non-superimposable. They form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Since `(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid` is a chiral molecule, a pure sample of it will be optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group.\n    *   The carbon atom C1, bonded to the -OH group, is a chiral center. It is attached to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH2-CH= (C2), and -CH=CH-CH2- (C6).\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptors `(1s,3s,5s)` indicate that all three -OH groups have the same relative stereochemistry (they are all on the same side of the ring, e.g., all *cis*).\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   Let's check for any chiral centers (a carbon atom with four different substituents).\n    *   The carbon in the `(CH3)2CH-` group is bonded to one H, two identical methyl (-CH3) groups, and a `-CH2-` group. It is not a chiral center.\n    *   No other carbon atom in the molecule has four different substituents. The cyclopentyl ring is also symmetrically substituted.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is optically inactive.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to assess whether each molecule is chiral and not a meso compound. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral and present as a single enantiomer or in an enantioenriched mixture. The naming of the compounds often provides crucial clues about their stereochemistry.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   Structure: `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`\n    *   A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality is a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   In this molecule, there are no chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond. The atoms Cl, H, C1, C2, the carbon of the methyl group, and the first carbon of the ethyl group all lie in the same plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   Since the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers (the bridgehead carbons).\n    *   Naming a compound with specific R/S descriptors means that we are referring to a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   Unless this specific stereoisomer happens to be a meso compound (which is not the case here, as the `(R,S)` combination in this specific ring system does not lead to a plane or center of symmetry), it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   A pure sample of a single enantiomer is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The stereoisomer is specified as `(2R,3S)`. When a molecule has two chiral centers with opposite configurations (R,S) and the groups attached to these centers are the same (here, both centers are attached to H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group), we must check if it is a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound is an achiral compound that has chiral centers. It possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, which makes it superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   The (2R,3S) isomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a classic example of a meso compound. It has a center of symmetry when in the anti-periplanar conformation.\n    *   Since it is a meso compound, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The configuration is `(2R,3R)`. This isomer does not have any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable (they are enantiomers).\n    *   The name refers to a single enantiomer, which is chiral. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an OH group at C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, the ring segment -CH2-CH=, and the ring segment -CH2-CH2-CH=. These two paths around the ring are different, so C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   As a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` is unusual, but in this context, it implies a symmetrical arrangement where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's visualize the molecule with all three OH groups pointing \"up\" from the average plane of the ring. This molecule has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and, more importantly, three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the C-H group on the opposite side of the ring (e.g., C1 and C4).\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The name describes a ketone where the carbonyl group is bonded to a cyclopentyl group and a 3-methylbutyl (isobutyl) group.\n    *   Structure: `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-(C5H9)` where C5H9 is a cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   Let's search for chiral centers. The carbon atom in the `CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. There are no other potential chiral centers in the chain or in the unsubstituted cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the `C=O`, `CH2`, and `CH` groups and bisects the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   Due to this plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. The presence of specific stereochemical descriptors like (R) or (S) indicates a specific enantiomer, which is optically active unless the molecule is an achiral meso compound.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure**: The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. C1 is bonded to H and Cl. C2 is bonded to a methyl group (-CH3) and an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The molecule is planar about the double bond. There are no chiral centers (carbon atoms with four different substituents). The plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The important part of the name for determining optical activity is `(3aR,7aS)`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: These descriptors indicate the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3a and 7a). The naming of a molecule as a single, specific enantiomer (by using R/S notation) implies that the molecule is chiral. While some molecules with multiple stereocenters can be achiral (meso compounds), the complex and asymmetric nature of this substituted methanoisobenzofuran derivative (especially with the substituent at position 8) makes it highly unlikely to have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure**: This is succinic acid with methyl groups on C2 and C3. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The molecule has two identical ends (COOH) and two stereocenters with opposite configurations (2R, 3S). This is a classic example of a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry, despite having stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure**: Same base structure as the previous compound, but with different stereochemistry.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The two stereocenters have the same configuration (2R, 3R). This molecule is chiral and does not have an internal plane of symmetry. Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) compound, and they are non-superimposable. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure**: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and a hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The name specifies the (R) configuration at C1. Let's verify C1 is a stereocenter. It is bonded to four different groups: (1) -H, (2) -OH, (3) the `-CH2-CH=CH-` part of the ring, and (4) the `-CH2-CH2-` part of the ring. Since the paths around the ring from C1 are different, the four groups are different. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter. The molecule as a whole lacks any symmetry elements that would make it achiral. The name designates a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure**: A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` is an older nomenclature indicating that all substituents have the same relative configuration (all cis).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: In the all-cis isomer, all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring. In a chair conformation, this means they are either all axial or all equatorial. This highly symmetric arrangement results in the molecule having multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through the C1-O bond and the C4 atom bisects the ring, with C2 reflecting onto C6 and C3 reflecting onto C5. Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a ketone with a cyclopentyl group on one side of the carbonyl and a 3-methylbutyl (isopentyl) group on the other. The structure is `Cyclopentyl-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: We need to check for any stereocenters.\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring consists of only -CH2- groups.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized.\n        *   In the 3-methylbutyl group, the carbon at position 3, `-CH(CH3)2`, is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the chain. Since it's bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter.\n        *   The molecule has no stereocenters and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   **Active**: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.\n*   **Inactive**: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.\n\nThere are **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

Therefore, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   This is a **meso compound**, which is **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above.\n    *   Let's draw the Fischer projection for the (2R,3R) isomer:\n        ```\n              COOH\n               |\n        CH3 -- C -- H   (2R)\n               |\n        CH3 -- C -- H   (3R)\n               |\n              COOH\n        ```\n    *   This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is not superimposable on its mirror image, which is the (2S,3S) isomer.\n    *   Therefore, it is **chiral** and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The name specifies a single enantiomer, (R), indicating the molecule is chiral.\n    *   Let's verify this. The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -H, (2) -OH, (3) the ring segment `-CH2-CH=CH-`, and (4) the ring segment `-CH2-CH2-CH=`. Because the path around the ring from C1 in each direction is different due to the position of the double bond, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, it is **chiral** and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is the isomer of cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (cis).\n    *   This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (σ_v). Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite C-H bond.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral** and thus **optically inactive**. Although C1, C3, and C5 are stereogenic carbons, the overall molecule is achiral (meso-like).\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's search for chiral centers.\n        *   The `CH(CH3)2` carbon is bonded to a hydrogen and two identical methyl groups, so it's not chiral.\n        *   All other carbons in the butanoyl chain are either sp2 hybridized (`C=O`) or part of a `CH2` group, so they are not chiral.\n        *   In the cyclopentyl ring, all carbons are `CH2` groups except for the one attached to the carbonyl. This carbon is attached to -H, the carbonyl group, and two `-CH2-` groups within the ring. The path around the ring in both directions is identical (`-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-`). Thus, this carbon is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and is **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary**:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive (achiral)\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it will exhibit optical activity. A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and is present as a single enantiomer or in an enantiomerically enriched form. The naming conventions used in the question imply we are considering single, specific stereoisomers. Therefore, the question is equivalent to identifying which of the listed compounds are chiral.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule has a double bond between C1 and C2. The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** To be chiral, a molecule must not be superimposable on its mirror image. This usually requires a chiral center or another element of chirality (axial, planar, helical).\n    *   This molecule has no chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups). The atoms around the C=C double bond lie in a plane. The molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane containing the double bond and the atoms directly attached to it). Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex name for a bicyclic compound. The core `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione` is a derivative of norbornane, specifically the saturated version of the Diels-Alder adduct between cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride. The parent molecule without the substituent is a meso compound (achiral) and has a plane of symmetry. The stereodescriptors `(3aR,7aS)` are consistent with a meso compound.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The substituent is `(E)-8-(chloromethylene)`, which means a `=C(H)Cl` group is attached to the C8 bridge carbon. This substituent lies on the plane of symmetry of the parent molecule. However, the substituent itself (`=C(H)Cl`) is not symmetric with respect to this plane. The presence of this substituent therefore destroys the plane of symmetry of the entire molecule. The desymmetrization of a meso compound results in a chiral molecule. Since the name specifies a single stereoisomer `(3aR,7aS,E)`, we are dealing with a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. (Note: While the chemical stability of this structure is questionable due to a double bond involving a bridge atom in a [2.2.1] system, we evaluate its chirality based on the provided name).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The stereoisomer is specified as `(2R,3S)`. When drawn, for example in a Fischer projection, this molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3. This makes it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral due to internal compensation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This is a diastereomer of the previous compound.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The `(2R,3R)` stereoisomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` enantiomer. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the ring segment `-CH2-C3=`, and (4) the ring segment `-C6H2-C5=`. These four groups are different, so C1 is a chiral center. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` designation indicates that all three OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This molecule, whether in its all-axial or all-equatorial chair conformation, possesses elements of symmetry. Specifically, it has three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite C-H group across the ring. The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral, even though it contains stereogenic centers (it is a meso compound).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The name describes a ketone. The parent chain is `butan-1-one`, which is a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. A cyclopentyl group is also on C1, and a methyl group is on C3. The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`. This can also be seen as isopentyl cyclopentyl ketone, or more systematically, `1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's look for chiral centers. The only potential chiral center is C3 of the butane chain. The groups attached to C3 are: H, -CH3 (C4), -CH3 (the substituent), and `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. Since C3 is attached to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no other elements of chirality. It is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nCounting the optically active compounds, we find there are 3.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nA molecule is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture (an equal mixture of both enantiomers). A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. However, a molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion (these are called meso compounds).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond. The atoms connected to the double bond (Cl, H, C, CH3, C of ethyl) lie in the same plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex molecule with multiple stereocenters.\n    *   The name explicitly gives the absolute configuration for several of these centers (`3aR`, `7aS`) and for a double bond (`E`).\n    *   When a specific enantiomer or diastereomer is indicated by R/S notations, it implies the molecule is a single stereoisomer.\n    *   A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active. While it is possible for a compound with R and S descriptors to be a meso compound (achiral), the complex and asymmetric nature of this bicyclic system, along with the non-equivalent stereocenters (3a and 7a), makes it virtually certain to be chiral. The naming convention confirms we are dealing with a specific, resolved stereoisomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (-H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other chiral group). This means a meso form is possible.\n    *   The meso form is the one with opposite configurations at the two equivalent stereocenters, i.e., (R,S) or (S,R).\n    *   Let's check for symmetry. The (2R,3S) isomer has a center of inversion when in the anti-periplanar conformation. A center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   This is a classic example of a meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound described above.\n    *   The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers form a pair of enantiomers. They are chiral and non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n    *   Since the compound is specified as a single enantiomer (2R,3R), it will rotate plane-polarized light.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (C3=C4) and an alcohol group (at C1).\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and the `-CH=CH-CH2-` part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral. The name specifies the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `s` notation (or assuming it means S for `sinister` or `syn`) indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   This all-cis isomer is highly symmetrical. Whether the OH groups are all axial or all equatorial (in the chair conformations), the molecule possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (σv).\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We need to check for any stereocenters. A stereocenter is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   There are no such carbon atoms in this molecule. The `CH` in the `CH(CH3)2` (isopropyl) group is attached to two identical methyl groups. All carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are CH2 groups.\n    *   The molecule lacks any chiral centers or other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). It has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe have identified three optically active compounds from the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nSo, the total number of optically active compounds is 3.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral. Generally, this means it should not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule has a double bond between C1 and C2. The structure is `ClCH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral. It does not have any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)`. The `R` and `S` designations specify the absolute configuration at chiral centers 3a and 7a. The `E` specifies the geometry at the double bond of the chloromethylene group. The naming of a specific enantiomer (using R/S) implies that the molecule is chiral and that this is one of its non-superimposable mirror images. A single enantiomer is always optically active. The structure is complex and lacks any obvious symmetry elements.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** Succinic acid is a four-carbon dicarboxylic acid. 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has the structure `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. There are two chiral centers, at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This molecule has two chiral centers with the same set of four substituents (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). This arrangement allows for the existence of a meso compound. The `(2R,3S)` stereoisomer is this meso compound. It possesses a center of inversion, which makes it superimposable on its mirror image. A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a diastereomer of the compound above, with the structure `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The `(2R,3R)` configuration does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` compound. A pure sample of the `(2R,3R)` enantiomer will rotate plane-polarized light.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine C1. It is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring (C2-C3 path), and 4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring (C6-C5-C4 path). Since the two paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule does not have any plane of symmetry. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single, pure enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `1s,3s,5s` designation (related to cis/trans) indicates that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's visualize the molecule. With all three -OH groups pointing 'up', the molecule has three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one of the C-OH groups and the CH2 group directly opposite it in the ring. For example, the plane containing C1 and C4 bisects the molecule into two identical halves (C2 reflects onto C6, and C3 reflects onto C5). Since the molecule has planes of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The IUPAC name is slightly unconventional, but the most plausible structure is a ketone where the carbonyl group is bonded to a cyclopentyl ring and an isobutyl group (`-CH2-CH(CH3)2`). The structure is `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's search for chiral centers. The carbon atoms in the isobutyl group are not chiral (C3 of the butanoyl chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups). The carbon in the cyclopentyl ring attached to the carbonyl is bonded to two identical `-CH2-` groups within the ring. There are no chiral centers. The molecule as a whole can adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry. This plane would bisect the cyclopentyl ring and the isobutyl group. Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: **Inactive**\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Inactive** (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: **Inactive** (achiral)\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: **Inactive** (achiral)\n\nCounting the number of optically active compounds, we find there are 3.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\nThe user wants to determine how many of the seven given compounds will exhibit optical activity. A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature leading to chirality is a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). However, a molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion; such compounds are called meso compounds. Conversely, some molecules without stereocenters can be chiral (e.g., allenes, atropisomers), but this is less common.\n\nWe will analyze each compound individually to determine its chirality.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The molecule is essentially planar. The plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex, polycyclic molecule with a rigid framework.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. These `R` and `S` descriptors are used to define the absolute configuration at specific stereocenters. The presence of these descriptors in the name indicates that the molecule is chiral and that a specific, single enantiomer is being described. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3). The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). When a molecule has two identical stereocenters, the diastereomer with opposite configurations (`R,S` or `S,R`) is a meso compound. Meso compounds possess an internal plane of symmetry (in at least one conformation) or a center of inversion, making them achiral and optically inactive despite having stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Inactive (meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound described above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` compound, and they are a pair of enantiomers. Since this compound is chiral, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring containing a C=C double bond and an alcohol group.\n    *   **Analysis:** Carbon C1, bonded to the -OH group, is a stereocenter. The four groups attached to it are: -H, -OH, the path around the ring towards the double bond (-CH2-CH=), and the path around the ring away from the double bond (-CH2-CH2-CH=). These two paths are different. The molecule as a whole lacks any element of symmetry. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all on the same side of the ring (all `cis`).\n    *   **Analysis:** Although carbons C1, C3, and C5 are stereocenters, the molecule as a whole is highly symmetrical. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH bond and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring. The presence of these planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The most plausible structure based on IUPAC nomenclature is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. The parent chain is a butan-1-one, with the carbonyl as C1. A methyl group is on C3. A cyclopentyl group is on C1. This gives `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`. Rechecking the numbering `C1(=O)-C2H2-C3H(CH3)-C4H3`. Yes, this is `3-methyl-butan-1-one`. The full name is `1-cyclopentyl-3-methyl-1-butanone`. The group is isobutyl, `(CH3)2CH-CH2-`. Let's build from the name again. `3-methylbutanoyl` is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-`. The ketone is cyclopentyl 3-methylbutanoyl ketone. So the structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's examine this structure for stereocenters.\n        *   The C3 of the chain is bonded to one H and two identical `CH3` groups, so it is not a stereocenter.\n        *   There are no other stereocenters in the chain or the cyclopentyl ring.\n        *   The molecule has no other sources of chirality like chiral axes or planes. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity, we have 3.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the optical activity of each compound. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters without any internal elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** ClHC=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃). This is an alkene.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar about the C=C double bond. This plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. There are no stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The name specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer with the configurations (3aR, 7aS) at two stereocenters and (E) at a double bond. When a specific enantiomer (indicated by R/S descriptors) is named, it implies the compound is chiral and has been resolved from its mirror image. Such a complex structure is highly unlikely to possess the symmetry required to be a meso compound. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is symmetric, as the groups attached to C2 are identical to the groups attached to C3 (H, CH₃, COOH). We need to check if the (2R,3S) configuration leads to a meso compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry. For a molecule with two equivalent stereocenters, the (R,S) isomer is a meso compound. This molecule has a center of inversion midway along the C2-C3 bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a meso compound. Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. This is a diastereomer of the previous compound.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Both stereocenters have the same configuration (R,R). This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is chiral, and its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring containing a double bond (between C3 and C4) and an alcohol group (at C1).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the -CH=CH-CH₂- path around the ring, and (4) the -CH₂-CH₂-CH= path around the ring. These two paths are different, so C1 is a stereocenter. The molecule as a whole lacks any element of symmetry. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The nomenclature `1s,3s,5s` indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all `cis`).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This is a highly symmetric molecule. Although C1, C3, and C5 are stereocenters, the molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through the C1-OH bond and the C4 atom acts as a mirror plane, reflecting C2 onto C6 and C3 onto C5. Since C3 and C5 have identical substituents in the same orientation, the molecule is symmetrical with respect to this plane. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-(Cyclopentyl).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We need to check for any stereocenters or overall molecular chirality. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The isobutyl group `((CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-)` is not chiral. The cyclopentyl ring attached to the carbonyl group is also not chiral, as the two paths around the ring from the point of attachment are identical. The molecule as a whole possesses a plane of symmetry that includes the carbonyl group and bisects both the isobutyl group and the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n*   **Active**: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   Inactive: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Active**: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Active**: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Inactive: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n*   Inactive: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nCounting the optically active compounds, we find there are 3.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity. A compound exhibits optical activity if and only if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (a carbon atom with four different substituents), but the ultimate test is the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion in the molecule.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule is an alkene. The atoms involved in the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. The structure is:\n        ```\n           Cl   CH3\n            \\ /\n             C=C\n            / \\\n           H   CH2CH3\n        ```\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral. It has no chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex, polycyclic molecule.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`. These are Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (R/S) notations that describe the absolute configuration at two specific chiral centers (carbons 3a and 7a). The fact that a specific enantiomer is named indicates that the molecule is chiral. A single, specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active. This compound is not a meso compound because it lacks the necessary internal symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The two chiral centers are identically substituted (both are bonded to H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). For such molecules, three stereoisomers exist: a pair of enantiomers (R,R and S,S) and a meso form (R,S). The (R,S) stereoisomer has a plane of symmetry between the two carbon atoms. A compound with chiral centers but an internal plane of symmetry is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a meso compound, which is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a different stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This is the (R,R) isomer. It is the enantiomer of the (S,S) isomer and a diastereomer of the meso (R,S) form. The (R,R) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an OH group at C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The name includes the stereodescriptor `(R)`, indicating that a specific enantiomer is being described. Let's verify the chirality. The carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, the ring path -CH2-CH=CH- (C2-C3-C4), and the ring path -CH2-CH2-CH= (C6-C5-C4). Since these two paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer `(R)` is specified, so it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Due to the symmetric 1,3,5-substitution pattern, the carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not chiral centers. For example, at C1, the path C1-C2-C3(OH)-C4-C5(OH)-C6 is identical to the path C1-C6-C5(OH)-C4-C3(OH)-C2. Thus, the two ring attachments to C1 are identical. The same applies to C3 and C5. Furthermore, any stereoisomer of this compound (e.g., all-cis or cis-trans) will possess at least one plane of symmetry. For instance, the all-`cis` isomer has three planes of symmetry. The notation (1s,3s,5s) is non-standard, but it cannot make an inherently achiral structure chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl ring)\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We look for any chiral centers (sp3 carbons with four different substituents).\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring consists of -CH2- groups. No chiral center.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2. Not a chiral center.\n        *   The carbon C2 (-CH2-) is not a chiral center.\n        *   The carbon C3 is bonded to a H, the rest of the chain, and two identical methyl (-CH3) groups. Since it has two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). It is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   **Active:** (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   **Active:** (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Active:** (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are **3** compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nAn optically active compound is a chiral compound. A compound is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most often due to the presence of one or more chiral centers, but can also arise from other elements of chirality like axial or planar chirality. A compound is achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   There are no chiral centers (carbon atoms bonded to four different groups) in this molecule.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains the `C=C` double bond and all the atoms directly attached to it. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:**\n    *   The name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)`. This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   The presence of `R` and `S` descriptors signifies the absolute configuration at chiral centers. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the compound must be chiral. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   However, the molecule is symmetric, meaning the groups on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group).\n    *   In such cases, the diastereomer with opposite configurations at the two identical chiral centers (one R, one S) is called a *meso* compound.\n    *   A meso compound is achiral because it has an internal element of symmetry (in this case, a center of inversion when drawn appropriately) and is superimposable on its mirror image. Achiral compounds are not optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The `(2R,3R)` configuration is diastereomeric to the meso `(2R,3S)` form.\n    *   The `(2R,3R)` isomer and its mirror image, the `(2S,3S)` isomer, are not superimposable on each other. They form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:**\n    *   The name specifies a single enantiomer, the `(R)` isomer.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the alkene part of the ring (`-CH=CH-`), and the alkane part of the ring (`-CH2-CH2-`).\n    *   Since a single enantiomer is specified, it is a chiral compound and will be optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:**\n    *   This nomenclature typically refers to the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (the *cis* isomer).\n    *   This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a C3 axis of rotation perpendicular to the ring. More importantly, it has three vertical planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:**\n    *   Let's determine the structure from the IUPAC name. The parent chain is `butan-1-one`, which is a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. A cyclopentyl group is attached to C1, and a methyl group is attached to C3.\n    *   The structure is: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. This can also be seen as a ketone formed from a cyclopentyl group and an isobutyl group `((CH3)2CH-CH2-)`.\n    *   We need to check for chiral centers. The only candidate is C3 of the butane chain. Let's analyze the groups attached to it by tracing the chain from that carbon:\n        *   The structure can be written as `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n        *   The carbon in question is the `CH` of the isobutyl group. It is bonded to one H atom, two methyl (-CH3) groups, and one `-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl` group.\n    *   Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no other chiral centers.

A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of one or more stereocenters and the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. Let's check for chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n        *   C1 and C2 are `sp2` hybridized and part of a double bond; they cannot be chiral centers.\n        *   The CH2 carbon (C3) is bonded to two identical hydrogen atoms. Not a chiral center.\n        *   The terminal CH3 carbon (C4) is bonded to three identical hydrogen atoms. Not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. Furthermore, the entire molecule is planar. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule, a derivative of a norbornane-type skeleton.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name itself provides the crucial information.\n        *   The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` indicate the presence of at least two stereocenters (at positions 3a and 7a) with a specific configuration.\n        *   A specific enantiomer is named. For a molecule to be named with specific `R` and `S` configurations for its stereocenters (and not be described as meso), it must be a chiral molecule.\n        *   Let's consider the possibility of it being a meso compound. The parent structure (without the C8 substituent) could potentially have a plane of symmetry. However, the substituent `8-(chloromethylene)` which is `=CHCl` is located on the methano bridge of the norbornane system. This substituent is asymmetric and breaks any potential plane of symmetry in the parent skeleton.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral, and a specific enantiomer is given. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n        *   The substituents on C2 and C3 are identical: -H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other -CH(CH3)COOH group.\n        *   When a molecule has multiple stereocenters and the groups on these centers are identical, there is a possibility of a meso form.\n        *   The specified configuration is `(2R,3S)`.

This isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a chiral molecule. A sample consisting of a single enantiomer like `(2R,3R)` will be optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's check for stereocenters.\n        *   Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, C2 (part of -CH=CH-), and C6 (part of -CH2-CH2-). Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n        *   A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral.\n        *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a chiral molecule, and a specific enantiomer is given. It is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Analysis:** The nomenclature `(1s,3s,5s)` is used to denote relative stereochemistry, typically meaning all three substituents are *cis* (on the same side of the ring).\n        *   Let's visualize the chair conformation. In the most stable conformation of the all-cis isomer, the three -OH groups can occupy the 1, 3, and 5 axial positions (all pointing \"up,\" for example).\n        *   This molecule, despite having stereocenters (C1, C3, C5), is highly symmetrical. It has a C3 axis of rotation and, more importantly, three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the opposite carbon atom (e.g., the plane containing C1, O1, and C4).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's search for any chiral elements.\n        *   **Chiral Centers:** There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The -CH(CH3)2 group has two identical methyl groups, so the CH carbon is not chiral. All carbons in the cyclopentyl ring have at least two identical substituents (either two hydrogens or two identical paths around the ring from the point of attachment).\n        *   **Other sources of chirality:** The molecule is not an allene, spirane, or atropisomer.

(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nTo determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which ones are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) is a common indicator of chirality, but the molecule as a whole must be asymmetric (i.e., it must not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is CH(Cl)=C(CH3)CH2CH3.\n    *   This is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   There are no stereocenters.\n    *   Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   This name describes a complex bicyclic molecule. The key information is in the stereodescriptors: (3aR, 7aS).\n    *   These descriptors indicate the absolute configuration at two specific stereocenters, C-3a and C-7a.\n    *   Naming a compound as a specific R/S isomer means we are considering a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is by definition optically active.\n    *   While some molecules with multiple stereocenters can be achiral (meso compounds, like the (2R,3S) isomer below), this typically requires a high degree of symmetry. The parent structure (endo-norbornane anhydride) is meso, but the presence of the unsymmetrical `=C(E)HCl` substituent at the bridge carbon (C8) destroys the plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is chiral, and since a specific enantiomer is given, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3: -H, -CH3, and -COOH.\n    *   In the (2R,3S) isomer, the two stereocenters have opposite configurations.\n    *   Drawing the molecule (e.g., using a Fischer projection) reveals a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3.\n    *   A compound with stereocenters but also a plane of symmetry is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Thus, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. Both stereocenters have the same configuration (R).\n    *   This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is chiral.\n    *   Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, which is non-superimposable.\n    *   As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   This molecule is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the alkene side of the ring (-CH=CH-), and the alkane side of the ring (-CH2-CH2-). The two paths around the ring from C1 are different.\n    *   Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   A molecule with a single stereocenter is chiral. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    *   It is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all on the same side of the ring (all-cis isomer).\n    *   The molecule has a high degree of symmetry. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry (σv). Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group.\n    *   Since the molecule has planes of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is (cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2.\n    *   Let's check for stereocenters. The carbon atom CH(CH3)2 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter. No other carbon atom is bonded to four different groups.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters. Due to free rotation around the single bonds, it can easily adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   The molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione (Active)\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (Active)\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol (Active)\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nTo determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which ones are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The absence of any improper axis of rotation (Sₙ), which includes a plane of symmetry (σ, S₁) and a center of inversion (i, S₂), is the condition for chirality.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is ClCH=C(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   This is an alkene. To be chiral, it would generally need a chiral center.\n    *   Let's check the carbon atoms for four different substituents:\n        *   C1: bonded to Cl, H, and C2 (double bond). Not a chiral center.\n        *   C2: bonded to CH₃, CH₂CH₃, and C1 (double bond). Not a chiral center.\n        *   C3: bonded to two H atoms, C2, and C4. Not a chiral center.\n        *   C4: bonded to three H atoms and C3. Not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. The molecule itself is planar about the double bond and possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane containing the double bond). Therefore, it is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name itself specifies the absolute configuration at multiple stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and a double bond (E). This strongly suggests the molecule is a single stereoisomer.\n    *   The parent skeleton, `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione` with (3aR, 7aS) configuration, corresponds to the *exo*-adduct of cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride (with modifications). This parent skeleton, known as *exo*-Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride followed by saturation, has a plane of symmetry and is a meso compound despite having chiral centers.\n    *   However, a substituent `8-(chloromethylene)` which is a `=CHCl` group is placed on the methano bridge (C7 in the corresponding norbornane system).\n    *   This substituent on the bridge lies on the original plane of symmetry of the skeleton. The substituent itself (`=CHCl`) breaks this symmetry because the H and Cl atoms are different. The original plane of symmetry is destroyed.\n    *   Since the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, it is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule is symmetric, as the two ends (HOOC-CH(CH₃)-) are identical.\n    *   When a symmetric molecule has two stereocenters with opposite configurations (R and S), it often results in a meso compound.\n    *   Drawing the molecule (e.g., in a Fischer projection) reveals a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3.\n        ```\n          COOH\n           |\n    CH₃ --|-- H   (R)\n           |\n     H  --|-- CH₃  (S)\n           |\n          COOH\n        ```\n    *   Due to this internal plane of symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image. It is a **meso compound** and thus **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the compound above. Both stereocenters have the same configuration (R,R).\n    *   Drawing the molecule shows no internal plane of symmetry.\n        ```\n          COOH\n           |\n    CH₃ --|-- H   (R)\n           |\n    CH₃ --|-- H   (R)\n           |\n          COOH\n        ```\n    *   Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound, and they are not superimposable. Therefore, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   The name specifies the configuration at C1 as (R). C1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH=CH- (C2), and -CH₂-CH₂- (C6). The paths around the ring from C1 are different.\n    *   Since the molecule is designated as a specific enantiomer (R), it is by definition **chiral** and optically active. It lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The 's' notation indicates that they all have the same relative configuration, meaning they are all on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C₃) and three planes of symmetry (σᵥ). Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH₂ group.\n    *   The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not true chiral centers (they are prochiral) because the two paths around the ring from each of these carbons are identical.\n    *   Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is a cyclopentyl ring attached to a carbonyl group, which is then attached to an isobutyl group: (C₅H₉)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂.\n    *   We check for chiral centers:\n        *   Cyclopentyl ring: all carbons are CH₂, so no chiral centers.\n        *   Chain: The carbon in the CH(CH₃)₂ group is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH₂-C(=O)-... group, and two identical methyl groups. Since two of the attached groups are identical, this is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). It is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compounds that are chiral and will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nTo determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to assess whether each molecule is chiral and not a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral carbons), but the molecule must lack any internal elements of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. If a molecule has stereocenters but also has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, it is a meso compound and is optically inactive.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2, Cl, the carbon of the methyl group, and the first carbon of the ethyl group) lie in the same plane. The entire molecule is essentially planar. Planar molecules are always superimposable on their mirror images. Therefore, this molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name provides the absolute configuration at two stereocenters, C-3a and C-7a, as (R) and (S) respectively (`3aR,7aS`). It also specifies the (E) geometry of the chloromethylene group. When a specific enantiomer is named using R/S notation, it implies that the molecule is chiral and the named substance is a single enantiomer. While some molecules with both R and S centers can be meso, the complex and unsymmetrical nature of the substituents (an (E)-chloromethylene group on the bridge) makes the presence of a plane of symmetry or center of inversion extremely unlikely. Naming a specific configuration `(3aR,7aS...)` designates a single chiral molecule. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3. The specific stereoisomer is (2R,3S). Let's examine its structure. If we draw it in an anti-periplanar (staggered) conformation and look down the C2-C3 bond, we can see that there is a center of inversion. The -COOH group on C2 is opposite to the -COOH on C3, the -CH3 on C2 is opposite to the -CH3 on C3, and the -H on C2 is opposite to the -H on C3. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. This is a classic example of a meso compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the compound above. It has two stereocenters, both with the R configuration. This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound, which is non-superimposable. Therefore, the (2R,3R) isomer is a chiral molecule. A sample consisting of only the (2R,3R) enantiomer will be optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the -CH2-CH= group (path towards C2), and (4) the -CH2-CH2-CH= group (path towards C6). Since the paths around the ring are different, C1 is a stereocenter. The name specifies the (R) configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The molecule as a whole lacks any internal symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The notation (1s,3s,5s) indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Analysis:** This highly symmetrical molecule possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry (σv). Each plane of symmetry passes through one carbon bearing an -OH group and the carbon atom opposite to it. For example, a plane contains C1-O1 and C4. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl. This is isobutyl cyclopentyl ketone.\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to check for any stereocenters.\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring has no substituents, so no chiral centers there.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized.\n        *   The -CH2- group next to the carbonyl is not chiral.\n        *   The next carbon is a -CH- group, which is bonded to a hydrogen and two identical methyl groups (-CH3). Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters and no other elements of chirality (like planar or axial chirality). It is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are three optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically means the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. We check for chiral centers and overall molecular symmetry.\n        *   There are no stereocenters (no carbon with four different single-bonded substituents).\n        *   However, chirality can also arise from the arrangement of groups around a double bond (planar chirality). The carbons of the double bond are C1 and C2.\n        *   Groups on C1: `Cl` and `H`. These are different.\n        *   Groups on C2: `-CH3` (methyl) and `-CH2CH3` (ethyl). These are different.\n        *   The molecule has the general structure `abC=Cde` where `a`≠`b` and `d`≠`e`. Let's draw the (Z)-isomer, where the high-priority groups on each carbon are on the same side. Priority(C1): `Cl` > `H`. Priority(C2): `-CH2CH3` > `-CH3`.\n            ```\n              Cl   CH2CH3\n               \\ /\n                C=C\n               / \\\n              H   CH3\n            ```\n        *   This molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The plane of the double bond is not a molecular plane of symmetry because of the constitution of the ethyl and methyl groups. Therefore, the molecule is chiral. Since it is a specific stereoisomer ((Z)-isomer), it will be optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active. **(1)**\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides the crucial information.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name includes stereochemical descriptors: `(3aR,7aS,E)`. These descriptors specify a single, unique stereoisomer. The parent structure (without the `8-(chloromethylene)` group) can be meso, but the addition of the `=CHCl` substituent breaks this symmetry. A molecule designated with specific R/S configurations is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound (unless it happens to be a meso compound, which is not the case here). A single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active. **(2)**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to check if this specific stereoisomer (`2R,3S`) is chiral or meso. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry.\n    *   Drawing the Fischer projection for the (2R, 3S) isomer reveals that it has a center of inversion (i), which makes it achiral. Alternatively, a staggered Newman projection or 3D model shows a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3 in the anti-conformation of the carboxyl groups. This is the definition of a *meso* compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive (meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This is another stereoisomer of the same molecule.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the `(R,R)` diastereomer. Unlike the `(R,S)` meso form, the `(R,R)` isomer and its mirror image, the `(S,S)` isomer, are not superimposable. The `(R,R)` isomer lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is therefore chiral. As a single, specified enantiomer, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active. **(3)**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at a stereocenter. This implies the molecule is chiral. Let's verify. Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) `-OH`, (2) `-H`, (3) `-CH2-CH=` (path towards C2), and (4) `-CH2-CH2-CH=` (path towards C6). Since the paths around the ring are different, C1 is indeed a stereocenter. The molecule as a whole is chiral. Since it's given as a single enantiomer `(R)`, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active. **(4)**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptors `(1s,3s,5s)` or the more common `cis` indicate that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all axial or all equatorial).\n    *   **Analysis:** This highly symmetric molecule is achiral. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry (each plane containing one C-OH group and bisecting the opposite C-C bond). Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral (meso).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The IUPAC name describes a ketone. The parent chain is butan-1-one, with the carbonyl at C1. A cyclopentyl group is attached to C1, and a methyl group is on C3. The structure is `cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`. This is also known as cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone: `cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Analysis:** We check for stereocenters. The carbon atom in the `CH(CH3)2` group is attached to a hydrogen, a `-CH2-` group, and two identical methyl groups (`-CH3`). Since it is attached to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter. There are no other stereocenters in the molecule. The molecule has a plane of symmetry in certain conformations, making it achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Optically active:\n    1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    3. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    4.

A compound is optically active if it is chiral and present as a single enantiomer or in an enantiomerically enriched mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature causing chirality is a stereocenter, but the overall molecular symmetry determines chirality.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   This molecule contains a C=C double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C from methyl, C from ethyl) lie in a single plane.\n    *   A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. There are no such sp3-hybridized carbons in this molecule.\n    *   Since the molecule is planar, it possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Therefore, it is achiral and not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3a and 7a). The descriptor `(E)` specifies the geometry of the chloromethylene (`=CH-Cl`) double bond.\n    *   The presence of stereochemical descriptors like `R` and `S` in the name of a compound indicates that a specific stereoisomer is being referred to.\n    *   While some molecules with multiple stereocenters can be achiral (meso compounds), this is usually due to a high degree of symmetry. The parent skeleton, `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione`, can be meso. However, the substituent `8-(chloromethylene)` is asymmetric (`=CH-Cl`). This substituent breaks any pre-existing plane of symmetry in the parent molecule.\n    *   The molecule is therefore chiral. By specifying a single stereoisomer (`3aR,7aS,E`), the name refers to a pure enantiomer (or diastereomer if other chiral centers exist), which is optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule is symmetric because the two ends are identical (COOH groups).\n    *   Let's consider the stereoisomers. There are the enantiomeric pair (2R,3R) and (2S,3S), and the diastereomer (2R,3S).\n    *   The (2R,3S) isomer has opposite configurations at its two stereocenters. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, the (2R,3S) isomer possesses a center of inversion (in its anti-periplanar conformation) and a plane of symmetry (in its eclipsed conformation). This makes it a meso compound.\n    *   Meso compounds are achiral, even though they have stereocenters, because they are superimposable on their mirror image. Therefore, this compound is not optically active.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) isomer is chiral. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, and they are non-superimposable.\n    *   Since (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and an OH group at C1.\n    *   Let's examine C1. It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -OH group\n        2.  -H atom\n        3.  The ring segment `-CH2-CH=` (path C1-C2-C3)\n        4.  The ring segment `-CH=CH-CH2-` (path C1-C6-C5-C4)\n    *   Since the four groups are different, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` indicates the relative stereochemistry, implying all three OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's check the carbons C1, C3, and C5. For C1, the two paths around the ring, -C2-C3(OH)-C4-C5(OH)-C6- and -C6-C5(OH)-C4-C3(OH)-C2-, are identical. Thus, C1 is not a stereocenter (it is a prochiral center). The same applies to C3 and C5.\n    *   The molecule has high symmetry. Specifically, the all-cis isomer possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bond.\n    *   Due to these elements of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and therefore not optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The IUPAC name describes a ketone. `...butan-1-one` attached to a `cyclopentyl` group means the structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-(chain)`. The chain is `3-methylbutyl`.\n    *   The acid `3-methylbutanoic acid` is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-COOH`.\n    *   So, the ketone has the structure `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. This is also known as cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone.\n    *   Let's check for stereocenters. The carbon in `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to a hydrogen, a `CH2` group, and two identical `CH3` groups. It is not a stereocenter. The cyclopentyl ring is attached to an achiral group. The molecule as a whole is flexible and possesses conformations with a plane of symmetry.\n    *   The molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe have identified the following optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it is optically active. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. Chirality means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators are the presence of stereocenters and the absence of internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, CH3, CH2CH3) lie in the same plane.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and therefore optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides critical information.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters. This means the name refers to a single, specific stereoisomer. A single stereoisomer is chiral unless it is a meso compound. Given the complexity and unsymmetrical substitution (`8-(chloromethylene)`), the molecule is certain to lack any internal symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The name specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. Therefore, it is optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. It possesses two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The substituents on C2 and C3 are the same (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). The configurations are opposite (R and S). This is the definition of a *meso* compound. Meso compounds are achiral because they possess an internal element of symmetry (a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion in at least one conformer).\n    *   **Conclusion:** As a meso compound, it is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a diastereomer of the compound above. It has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Both stereocenters have the same (R) configuration. This molecule does not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is therefore a chiral molecule. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The name specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral pair. Therefore, it is optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Let's check C1 for chirality. It is bonded to four different groups: (1) -H, (2) -OH, (3) the ring path -CH2-CH=, and (4) the ring path -CH2-C5H2-C4H=. Because the paths around the ring are different (one path encounters the double bond sooner than the other), C1 is a stereocenter. The molecule is chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The name `(R)-...` specifies a single enantiomer. Therefore, it is optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor 's' usually denotes relative stereochemistry (cis/trans). Assuming it means all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. C1 is bonded to -H, -OH, and two identical paths around the ring (-C2H2-C3H(OH)-... and -C6H2-C5H(OH)-...). Thus, C1, C3, and C5 are not stereocenters. The all-cis isomer possesses a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry. The other diastereomer (one OH trans to the other two) also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral due to its high symmetry. It is optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule's formula is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** We need to check for any stereocenters. A review of all carbon atoms reveals none. The carbon in the `CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups. All other carbons are either sp2 hybridized or are part of a CH2 group or have two identical paths in the ring. The molecule has no stereocenter.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks any internal planes of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   The molecule is planar around the carbon-carbon double bond. A planar molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex, bridged bicyclic molecule.\n    *   The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors: `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the molecule has chiral centers and a specific stereoisomer (a single enantiomer) is being described.\n    *   A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active. The structure does not possess a plane of symmetry that would make it a meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3).\n    *   However, the two ends of the molecule are identical (COOH groups), and the substituents on the chiral carbons are also identical (H and CH3 on each).\n    *   The stereochemistry is `(2R,3S)`, which means the two chiral centers have opposite configurations. In a molecule with two identical chiral centers, the R,S (or S,R) configuration results in a *meso* compound.\n    *   Meso compounds have an internal plane of symmetry and are **achiral**, despite having chiral centers. They are optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound.\n    *   The stereochemistry is `(2R,3R)`. Both chiral centers have the same configuration.\n    *   This molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is not superimposable on its mirror image (which is the (2S,3S) isomer).\n    *   Thus, the `(2R,3R)` isomer is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound and is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at C1. The carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and (4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different due to the asymmetric location of the double bond relative to C1.\n    *   Therefore, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups in a *cis* relationship (all pointing in the same direction relative to the ring, e.g., all axial or all equatorial in a chair conformation).\n    *   This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH bond and bisecting the opposite C-C bond.\n    *   Due to these planes of symmetry, the molecule is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   Let's determine the structure from the IUPAC name. The parent chain is `butan-1-one`, indicating a 4-carbon chain with a ketone function at C1. `C4-C3-C2-C1(=O)-`. A `cyclopentyl` group is attached to C1, and a `methyl` group is attached to C3.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. This can also be seen as isobutyl cyclopentyl ketone.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The only potential chiral center is C3.\n    *   The C3 atom is bonded to four groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H).\n        2.  A methyl group from the end of the chain (-CH3, which is C4).\n        3.  The `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group.\n        4.  A substituent methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   So, the groups on C3 are -H, -CH3, -CH3, and the rest of the chain. Let's write the structure more clearly: `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. The carbon in the `CH` group is C3. It is attached to H, two identical -CH3 groups, and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group.\n    *   Since C3 is attached to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has a plane of symmetry (containing the H-C3-C2-C1=O bonds and bisecting the angle between the two C3-methyl bonds).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\nSummary of optically active compounds:\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione** (Yes)\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid** (Yes)\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol** (Yes)\n\nTotal count of optically active compounds is 3.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nA molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers). However, a molecule with stereocenters can still be achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion; such a compound is called a meso compound.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃. This molecule contains a C=C double bond, but no stereocenters (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). The molecule is planar and thus has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), making it achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself provides the key information. The prefixes `(3aR,7aS)` indicate the presence of at least two chiral centers with a specific absolute configuration. This defines a single stereoisomer. For a compound with multiple stereocenters to be inactive, it must be a meso compound. Given the complexity and lack of symmetry of the bridged ring system, especially with an attached `(E)-chloromethylene` group (=CHCl), it is extremely unlikely that the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. A specific, single enantiomer like this is, by definition, chiral. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH₃, COOH). The `(2R,3S)` configuration means the two stereocenters have opposite configurations. This is the defining characteristic of the meso isomer of this compound. A meso compound has a plane of symmetry and/or a center of inversion, making it achiral despite having stereocenters. Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration indicates that the two stereocenters have the same configuration. This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion and is chiral. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer. As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This molecule has a stereocenter at C1. The four groups attached to C1 are: -OH, -H, the ring segment -CH₂-CH=CH-, and the ring segment -CH₂-CH₂-CH=. These two ring segments are different. Since there is only one stereocenter, the molecule is guaranteed to be chiral. The name `(R)-` specifies one of the two enantiomers. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The `(1s,3s,5s)` nomenclature suggests the *cis,cis* relative stereochemistry, meaning all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. In its most stable chair conformation, all three -OH groups are in equatorial positions. This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry (each one passing through a C-OH group and the opposite CH₂ group) as well as a C₃ axis of rotation. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are prochiral, not chiral centers. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl ring). Let's examine the molecule for stereocenters. The carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and not a stereocenter. No carbon in the cyclopentyl ring is a stereocenter as the paths around the ring from the point of attachment are identical. In the isobutyl group, the C3 atom is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter. With no stereocenters or any other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality), the molecule is achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of one or more chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. If a molecule has more than one chiral center, it can be achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion; such a compound is called a meso compound. We will analyze each compound to determine if it is chiral.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers (an sp3 carbon with four different substituents). There are no chiral centers in this molecule. C3 is bonded to two identical hydrogen atoms, and C4 is bonded to three identical hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond, but the atoms around the double bond are largely in a plane. The molecule as a whole can adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name itself specifies the absolute configuration at multiple stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and the geometry of a double bond (E).\n    *   The specification of a single set of stereochemical descriptors (R, S, E) defines a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   A single stereoisomer is, by definition, optically active unless it happens to be a meso compound.\n    *   Given the complexity and lack of symmetry in the name and implied structure, it is extremely unlikely to be meso. The presence of defined chiral centers designated as R and S confirms its chirality.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   Let's consider the arrangement of groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that can pass through the C2-C3 bond in an eclipsed conformation. The top half (`HOOC-CH(CH3)-`) is the mirror image of the bottom half.\n    *   The (2R,3S) isomer is a **meso compound**. Meso compounds have chiral centers but are achiral overall due to internal symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is non-superimposable on its mirror image, (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The question specifies a single enantiomer, (2R,3R).\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group on C1.\n    *   Let's examine C1. It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        2.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n        3.  The ring path towards the double bond: -C2H2-C3H=\n        4.  The ring path away from the double bond: -C6H2-C5H2-\n    *   Since the paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule has one chiral center, so it must be chiral.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The notation (1s,3s,5s), while not standard IUPAC, in a symmetrical case like this typically denotes the highly symmetric all-cis isomer (all OH groups on the same side of the ring).\n    *   This all-cis isomer possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group.\n    *   Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not true chiral centers because the two paths around the ring from each of these carbons are identical.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The IUPAC name corresponds to the structure `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The only potential candidate is C3 of the butane chain.\n    *   C3 is bonded to a hydrogen atom, the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group, and two methyl (-CH3) groups.\n    *   Since C3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no other stereogenic elements (like axial or planar chirality).\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n**Summary:**\n1.  (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Achiral\n2.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Chiral**\n3.  (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Achiral (meso)\n4.

A compound is optically active if it is chiral and present as a single enantiomer. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of one or more stereocenters and the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The double bond is between C1 and C2.\n    *   This molecule has a double bond, but no chiral centers (carbon atoms bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule is essentially planar. A plane containing all the atoms of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule.\n    *   The name provides the specific stereochemistry: `(3aR,7aS,E)`. The `R` and `S` designations refer to the absolute configuration at specific stereocenters (the bridgehead carbons 3a and 7a).\n    *   When a compound is named as a specific stereoisomer (e.g., with R/S labels), it refers to a single enantiomer or a diastereomer. A single enantiomer is always optically active.\n    *   A compound with stereocenters can be achiral only if it is a meso compound, which requires an internal plane of symmetry. Given the complex and asymmetric nature of the molecule (an isobenzofuran-dione core with a methano bridge and a chloromethylene substituent), it does not possess a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, this specific named stereoisomer is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The specified configuration is `(2R,3S)`. Let's examine its structure, for example, using a Fischer projection.\n        ```\n              COOH\n              |\n        CH3 - C - H   (This is the 2R center)\n        -----------\n          H - C - CH3   (This is the 3S center)\n              |\n              COOH\n        ```\n    *   There is a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3. The top half is the mirror image of the bottom half.\n    *   A compound with stereocenters but also an internal plane of symmetry is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The configuration is `(2R,3R)`.\n    *   This isomer does not have a plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule.\n    *   It is one of a pair of enantiomers (the other being the (2S,3S) isomer). As a single, specified enantiomer, it is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, the `-CH2-C6-` part of the ring, and the `-CH=C2-` part of the ring. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry.\n    *   The name `(R)-...` specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This compound has three hydroxyl groups on a cyclohexane ring. There are several possible stereoisomers.\n    *   The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` is non-standard for monocyclic systems, but `s` is often used for `syn`, which is equivalent to `cis`. Interpreting this name as the `all-cis` isomer is the most chemically reasonable approach.\n    *   In the all-cis isomer, all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (e.g., all axial or all equatorial in the chair conformation).\n    *   This `all-cis` isomer is highly symmetric. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (σv).\n    *   Due to the presence of these planes of symmetry, the molecule is **achiral**, even though it contains prochiral centers. Achiral compounds are not optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(C5H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We need to check for any chiral centers or other elements of chirality.\n    *   None of the carbon atoms are bonded to four different groups. The carbon in the `CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups. All carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are `CH2` groups except for the one attached to the carbonyl, which is also not a stereocenter as the two paths around the ring from this point are identical.\n    *   The molecule has an accessible conformation with a plane of symmetry (e.g., the plane that contains the carbonyl group and bisects the cyclopentyl ring).\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe following compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nIn total, there are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound exhibits optical activity if and only if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This typically means the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. This molecule contains no sp3 carbon bonded to four different groups, so it has no chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule is not an allene, biphenyl, or helicene, which are special cases of chirality without chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that includes the C=C double bond. While the ethyl and methyl groups are not entirely in this plane, free rotation of the single bonds allows for a conformation where a plane of symmetry exists. A molecule that can adopt a conformation with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name itself provides the key information. The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. The `(E)` descriptor specifies the geometry at a double bond.\n    *   When a compound's name includes specific stereochemical descriptors like (R) or (S), it refers to a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   A single stereoisomer is optically active unless it is a *meso* compound (an achiral compound with chiral centers).\n    *   Given the complexity of this bicyclic structure and the presence of the asymmetric `(E)-chloromethylene` substituent, it is extremely unlikely that the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry or center of inversion that would render it meso.\n    *   Thus, the name describes a single enantiomer of a chiral compound.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers, C2 and C3.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as (2R, 3S). Let's examine its structure, for instance, using a Fischer projection.\n        ```\n             COOH\n              |\n        H ---|--- CH3  (C2 is R)\n        ------|------  (Plane of symmetry)\n      CH3 ---|--- H    (C3 is S)\n              |\n             COOH\n        ```\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3.

The stereochemistry is (2R, 3R).\n    *   Let's draw its Fischer projection:\n        ```\n             COOH\n              |\n        H ---|--- CH3  (C2 is R)\n              |\n        H ---|--- CH3  (C3 is R)\n              |\n             COOH\n        ```\n    *   This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S, 3S) isomer.\n    *   The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with an alcohol group at C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        2.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n        3.  -CH2-CH= (path towards C2)\n        4.  -CH2-CH2-CH= (path towards C6)\n    *   Since the two paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any element of symmetry.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor 's' in this context implies that the substituents have the same relative stereochemistry (all cis). This means all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring's plane.\n    *   Let's check for chirality at C1. The groups are H, OH, and two paths around the ring: -CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2- and -CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-. These two paths are identical. Therefore, C1 is not a chiral center. By symmetry, C3 and C5 are also not chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule possesses planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through the C1-OH bond and the C4 atom bisects the ring, with C2 and C6 being mirror images, and C3 and C5 being mirror images. Since C3 and C5 are identically substituted, this is a valid plane of symmetry. In fact, the molecule has three such planes of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is `(C5H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. The C5H9 group is a cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   Let's search for chiral centers. A carbon atom needs to be sp3 hybridized and bonded to four different groups.\n    *   In the butane chain: The carbonyl carbon is sp2. C2 is a -CH2- group. C3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH2- group, and two identical methyl (-CH3) groups. So, C3 is not chiral.\n    *   In the cyclopentyl ring: Every carbon is a -CH2- group, except for the one attached to the carbonyl. This carbon is bonded to the carbonyl chain, a hydrogen, and two -CH2- groups within the ring. The ring is unsubstituted, so the paths around the ring are identical. Thus, no carbon in the ring is chiral.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and is not of a type that exhibits chirality without one. It is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n- (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n- (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n- (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n- 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nTo determine if a compound is optically active, we need to assess its chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and is not present as a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers). The compounds listed are given as specific stereoisomers (or without any stereochemical designation, implying a racemic mixture or an achiral compound). We will analyze each one for chirality. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature leading to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups), but the ultimate test is the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion in the molecule.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene.

This notation is used to specify the absolute configuration of specific chiral centers in the molecule, meaning a single enantiomer is being described. While the parent structure (without the `8-(chloromethylene)` group) is a meso compound and thus achiral, the addition of a substituent breaks the internal symmetry. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule possesses two chiral centers (C2 and C3). The substituents on C2 are identical to those on C3. The configurations are given as opposite `(R,S)`. This is the definition of a meso compound. A meso compound has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry and is achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It has two chiral centers with the same configuration `(R,R)`. The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` stereoisomer. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Analysis:** The carbon atom with the `-OH` group (C1) is bonded to four different groups: (1) `-H`, (2) `-OH`, (3) `-CH2-CH=CH-` (pathway around the ring in one direction), and (4) `-CH2-CH2-CH=` (pathway around the ring in the other direction). The two pathways around the ring are different due to the location of the double bond. Therefore, C1 is a chiral center.

In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. Let's check the potential chiral centers C1, C3, and C5. From C1, the path to C2 and then to C3(OH) is identical to the path to C6 and then to C5(OH). Thus, the carbons bearing the OH groups are not chiral centers. The molecule has several planes of symmetry (e.g., a plane passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite CH2 group).

The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized. The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. In the cyclopentyl ring, the carbon attached to the carbonyl is bonded to two identical `-CH2-` groups within the ring. The molecule has no chiral centers. It also has a plane of symmetry in achievable conformations.

The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C of methyl, C of ethyl) lie in the same plane.\n    *   This planarity creates a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), which makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   There are no chiral centers (carbon atoms bonded to four different groups).\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides the crucial information.\n    *   The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters. The `(E)` specifies the geometry of a double bond.\n    *   Naming a compound with specific absolute configurations (R/S) implies that it is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. A single enantiomer is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   The only exception would be if the molecule were a *meso* compound (an achiral compound with stereocenters). However, the structure and the naming `(3aR,7aS)` for the given complex skeleton do not correspond to a typical meso compound. The presence of the unsymmetrical `=(E)-CHCl` substituent further ensures the molecule lacks the necessary symmetry to be achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is a specific chiral molecule and is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as the substituents on C3 (-H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other -CH(CH3)COOH group). These are called equivalent stereocenters.\n    *   For molecules with two equivalent stereocenters, the diastereomer with the `(R,S)` or `(S,R)` configuration is a *meso* compound.\n    *   A meso compound has stereocenters, but it is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. In its anti-periplanar conformation, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has a center of inversion.\n    *   Since it is achiral, it is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The `(2R,3R)` isomer is a diastereomer of the meso `(2R,3S)` form.\n    *   The mirror image of the `(2R,3R)` isomer is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. These two `(R,R)` and `(S,S)` isomers are non-superimposable and form a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   Since the `(2R,3R)` isomer is a single enantiomer and is chiral, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and a hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH=CH- (part of the ring), and -CH2-CH2- (the other part of the ring). Therefore, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule does not possess any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   The name `(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol` specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This name describes a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptors `(1s,3s,5s)` typically refer to the relative stereochemistry, indicating that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   In this all-cis isomer, the two paths around the ring from any of the substituted carbons (C1, C3, C5) are identical. For example, from C1, the path C1-C2-C3(-OH)... is the same as C1-C6-C5(-OH)... Therefore, C1, C3, and C5 are not technically chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (σv).\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The IUPAC name `butan-1-one` designates a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. This requires a substituent on C1, which is the `1-cyclopentyl` group. The `3-methyl` is a substituent on C3 of the butane chain.\n    *   The structure is: `cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers (sp3 carbons with four different substituents).\n    *   The only potential candidate is C3 of the butan-1-one chain.\n    *   The four groups attached to C3 are:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -CH3 (the C4 of the butane chain)\n        3.  -CH3 (the methyl group from the \"3-methyl\" substituent)\n        4.  -CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl (the rest of the molecule)\n    *   Since two of the groups attached to C3 are identical methyl groups, C3 is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no other stereocenters and is achiral. It has a plane of symmetry in a suitable conformation.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No\n2.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Yes**\n3.  (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: No\n4.

(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: No\n7.  1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when a molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C from methyl, C from ethyl) lie in the same plane.\n    *   **Chirality**: This molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry coinciding with the plane of the molecule itself. Therefore, it is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion**: It is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a complex, bridged bicyclic compound. The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors: (3aR, 7aS) for two stereocenters at the ring fusion and (E) for the configuration of the exocyclic double bond (=CHCl).\n    *   **Chirality**: When a specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is designated by R/S notation, it is, by definition, optically active. The complex structure with defined stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and an unsymmetrical substituent (=CHCl) is highly unlikely to possess any internal symmetry that would make it a meso compound. The explicit naming of a single stereoisomer implies it has been resolved or synthesized in an enantiomerically pure form.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, and thus it is optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (-H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other chiral carbon group).\n    *   **Chirality**: This molecule is a classic example used to illustrate the concept of meso compounds. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The (2R,3S) configuration (which is identical to 2S,3R) corresponds to the meso isomer.\n    *   We can see this by drawing its conformation. In an eclipsed conformation (looking down the C2-C3 bond), there is a plane of symmetry between the two carbons. In a staggered conformation (with COOH groups anti), there is a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is a meso compound. It is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a diastereomer of the compound above. It has the same connectivity but a different spatial arrangement.\n    *   **Chirality**: The (2R,3R) isomer does not have any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, and they are not superimposable. A specific enantiomer like (2R,3R) will rotate plane-polarized light.\n    *   **Conclusion**: It is a chiral molecule, and the single enantiomer specified is optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and a hydroxyl group on C1.\n    *   **Chirality**: The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the ring segment -CH2-C6-, and 4) the ring segment -CH2-C2-. Tracing the paths around the ring from C1, one path immediately encounters a double bond (-C2-C3=C4-), while the other does not (-C6-C5-C4=). Thus, the two ring pathways are different, making C1 a stereocenter. The name specifies the (R)-enantiomer. The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion**: It is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule and is therefore optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor (1s,3s,5s) or simply \"cis\" indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (e.g., all pointing up).\n    *   **Chirality**: If we consider the chair conformation where the three OH groups are all in axial positions (or all in equatorial positions), the molecule has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3). More importantly for chirality, it has three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one carbon bearing an OH group and the opposite CH2 group on the ring (e.g., the plane containing C1 and C4). Because it possesses planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: It is an achiral molecule and optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   **Chirality**: To be chiral, a molecule typically needs a stereocenter or another element of chirality. Let's check for stereocenters (a carbon with four different substituents).\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring has no stereocenters.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon C=O is sp2 hybridized, not a stereocenter.\n        *   The -CH2- group has two identical hydrogens.\n        *   The -CH(CH3)2 group has a carbon bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH2- group, and two identical methyl groups. Since two of the groups are identical, this is not a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters and no other sources of chirality (like axial or planar chirality).\n    *   **Conclusion**: It is an achiral molecule and optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. However, a molecule with stereocenters can still be achiral if it possesses an element of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion (such molecules are called meso compounds). We will analyze each compound to determine if it is chiral.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `CH3-CH2-C(CH3)=CHCl`.\n    *   This molecule does not have any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that is the plane containing the double bond atoms (C1, C2, Cl, H attached to C1, C3 and the first carbon of the ethyl group).\n    *   Since it is achiral, it is **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`. These R/S assignments specify a particular stereoisomer.\n    *   The presence of such specific descriptors indicates that the molecule has stereocenters and that we are considering a single, defined stereoisomer.\n    *   Unless this specific combination of R and S configurations results in a meso compound (which is highly unlikely for such a complex, unsymmetrical structure), the molecule is chiral. A single enantiomer is, by definition, chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (-H, -CH3, -COOH). This suggests the possibility of a meso compound.\n    *   The (2R,3S) configuration refers to the meso form of this molecule. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry.\n    *   Let's draw the molecule in a staggered conformation looking down the C2-C3 bond. The (2R, 3S) conformer can adopt a conformation with a center of inversion (a point of symmetry). It also has a conformation with a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Because it is a meso compound, it is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) configuration and its mirror image, (2S,3S), are enantiomers. They are non-superimposable mirror images.\n    *   This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Thus, the (2R,3R) isomer is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and a hydroxyl group on C1.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at C1. C1 is a stereocenter because it is attached to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH2-CH=, and -CH2-CH2-CH=.\n    *   The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Since the name describes a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is cyclohexane with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all on the same side of the ring (cis).\n    *   Let's consider its chair conformation. With all OH groups in axial positions, the molecule has three planes of symmetry, each passing through a C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. It also has a C3 axis of rotation.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry means the molecule is achiral. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are prochiral, not true stereocenters, because the path around the ring from these positions is identical in both directions.\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The IUPAC name describes a butan-1-one parent chain, substituted with a cyclopentyl group at C1 and a methyl group at C3.\n    *   The structure is: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. This is also known as isobutyl cyclopentyl ketone, `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   We need to check for any chiral centers. The only potential candidate is C3 of the butanoyl chain. However, this carbon atom is bonded to two identical methyl groups (one being C4 of the chain and one being the substituent), a hydrogen atom, and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Since it is attached to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The rest of the molecule also lacks any stereocenters or other elements of chirality.\n    *   The molecule is achiral and therefore **not optically active**.\n\nSummary of optically active compounds:\n- (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: Yes\n- (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: No (meso)\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Yes\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes\n- (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: No (achiral)\n- 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No (achiral)\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThis question requires us to determine how many of the given compounds are chiral. A compound is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Chiral compounds are optically active. We will analyze each compound for elements of chirality, such as chiral centers, and the absence of elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. There are no chiral centers (sp3 carbons with four different substituents). The molecule is planar around the double bond. This plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    This compound's IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. The R/S notation is used to specify the absolute configuration of chiral centers. The naming of a specific enantiomer implies that the compound is chiral and has been resolved from its mirror image. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3). However, the substituents on C2 (`-H`, `-CH3`, `-COOH`, and `-CH(CH3)COOH`) are the same as the substituents on C3. For such symmetrically substituted molecules, the stereoisomer with an (R,S) or (S,R) configuration is a *meso* compound. A meso compound is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it superimposable on its mirror image. Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid are a pair of enantiomers. They are chiral and non-superimposable on their mirror images. As a single, specific enantiomer, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and a hydroxyl group at C1. The carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) `-OH`, (2) `-H`, (3) `-CH2-CH=`, and (4) `-CH2-CH2-CH=`. The two paths around the ring from C1 are different, so C1 is a chiral center. The name specifies a single enantiomer `(R)`. This compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation, although non-standard, likely implies that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (the *all-cis* isomer). This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. It has a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one hydroxylated carbon and the carbon at the opposite side of the ring. Due to the presence of these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**. The other possible stereoisomer (one -OH trans to the other two) is also achiral.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    Let's determine the structure from the IUPAC name. The parent chain is `butan-1-one`, which means a four-carbon chain with a ketone at position 1: `C4-C3-C2-C1(=O)`. There is a methyl substituent at C3 and a cyclopentyl group at C1. The full structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. We need to check for chiral centers. Let's analyze C3. It is bonded to: (1) a hydrogen atom, (2) the terminal methyl group (C4), (3) the methyl substituent, and (4) the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Groups (2) and (3) are both methyl groups, so they are identical. Since C3 does not have four different substituents, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no other potential chiral centers and no other elements of chirality. Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   Optically Active: (2), (4), (5)\n*   Optically Inactive: (1), (3), (6), (7)\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. A compound with stereocenters but also an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is called a meso compound and is achiral (optically inactive).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** ClHC=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C of methyl, C of ethyl) lie in a single plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral. Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The key part of the name is the stereochemical descriptors: **(3aR,7aS,E)**.\n    *   **Analysis:** These descriptors specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3a and 7a) and the geometry of a double bond (E). The designation of a specific enantiomer (using R/S notation) for a complex molecule that does not possess internal symmetry (it is not a meso compound) means the molecule is chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A pure sample of a single enantiomer is always optically active. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereocenters have opposite configurations (one R, one S). The substituents on C2 (H, CH₃, COOH) are identical to those on C3. Let's visualize the molecule. It's possible to find a conformation that possesses a center of inversion midway between the C2-C3 bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. This is a classic example of a **meso compound**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Meso compounds are achiral and thus optically inactive. Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. The two stereocenters are C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereocenters have the same configuration (both R). This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, which is non-superimposable. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Conclusion:** As a chiral molecule, a pure sample of the (2R,3R) enantiomer is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group on C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the -CH₂-CH₂- path, and the -CH=CH- path. Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter. The name specifies a single enantiomer, the (R)-isomer. A molecule with a single stereocenter is chiral (unless it can racemize under ambient conditions, which is not the case here).\n    *   **Conclusion:** A pure sample of the (R) enantiomer is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with -OH groups at C1, C3, and C5.\n    *   **Analysis:** This name is subtle. The lowercase `s` descriptor is the IUPAC designation for absolute configuration (equivalent to `S`), often used for pseudoasymmetric centers or in specific compound classes. The use of absolute configuration descriptors like `(1s,3s,5s)` implies that C1, C3, and C5 are true stereocenters. This can only happen if the molecule as a whole is chiral. The all-cis isomer of cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol is highly symmetric (it has a C₃ axis and three planes of symmetry) and is achiral; its C1, C3, C5 atoms are not stereocenters because the paths around the ring are identical. Therefore, the name must refer to a chiral diastereomer, specifically the one where two -OH groups are cis to each other and one is trans. This diastereomer is chiral, and the name specifies one of its two enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the name specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-(C₅H₉).\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's search for stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH₂- group, and two identical methyl (-CH₃) groups. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter. No other atom in the molecule is a stereocenter. The molecule also possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule is achiral, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Optically inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. (3 compounds)\n- Optically active: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. (4 compounds)\n\nThere are 4 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) and the absence of any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The double bond geometry is Z (cis), meaning the Cl and the ethyl group (-CH2CH3) are on the same side of the double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule contains a double bond. All atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2, H on C1, Cl on C1, C of methyl, C of ethyl) lie in the same plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the molecule (assuming free rotation of the ethyl group). There are no chiral centers in the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex tricyclic molecule. The name itself provides the crucial information.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)` indicate the presence of chiral centers with a specific absolute configuration. A name that specifies a single stereoisomer with `R` or `S` designations implies that the molecule is chiral and the name refers to one of its enantiomers. While some molecules with chiral centers can be achiral (meso compounds), this molecule's complex and unsymmetrical structure (due to the E-chloromethylene group, `=CHCl`, and the tricyclic core) makes it extremely unlikely to have a plane of symmetry or center of inversion. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and therefore **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The `(2R, 3S)` designation indicates the stereochemistry. Let's analyze its symmetry. If you draw the molecule in a staggered conformation or a Fischer projection, you can identify a center of inversion (`i`) halfway along the C2-C3 bond. In an eclipsed conformation, a plane of symmetry (σ) becomes apparent. The presence of these symmetry elements means the molecule is achiral, despite having two chiral centers. This is a classic example of a meso compound.\n        ```\n          COOH\n          |\n      H --|-- CH3   (2R)\n          |\n    CH3 --|-- H     (3S)\n          |\n          COOH\n        (Center of inversion is present)\n        ```\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a meso compound, which is achiral. It is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a diastereomer of the previous compound, `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH` with the `(2R,3R)` configuration.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This stereoisomer lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` compound, which is non-superimposable. The `(2R,3R)` and `(2S,3S)` forms constitute a pair of enantiomers.\n        ```\n              COOH\n              |\n          H --|-- CH3   (2R)\n              |\n          H --|-- CH3   (3R)\n              |\n              COOH\n        (No internal symmetry elements)\n        ```\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and therefore **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the ring segment `-CH2-CH=` (path C2-C3), and 4) the ring segment `-CH2-CH2-` (path C6-C5). Since these four groups are different, C1 is a chiral center. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and a specific enantiomer is given. It is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation implies that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (the all-cis isomer).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** There are two possible stereoisomers for 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol: the all-cis isomer and the cis,trans isomer (one -OH trans to the other two).\n        *   The all-cis isomer possesses a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry contains one C-OH bond and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring.\n        *   The cis,trans isomer (e.g., 1,3-cis, 5-trans) also possesses a plane of symmetry passing through the carbon atom of the trans-substituent (C5) and the CH2 group opposite to it (C2).\n        Since both possible stereoisomers of this compound have at least one plane of symmetry, they are all achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The name indicates a butan-1-one parent chain, meaning a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. The group at C1 is cyclopentyl, and there is a methyl group at C3. This leads to the structure: `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We need to search for any chiral centers.\n        *   The isobutyl group `–CH2–CH(CH3)2` has no chiral center (the carbon with two methyl groups is not chiral).\n        *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized and not a chiral center.\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring has a single, achiral substituent. The ring itself retains a plane of symmetry.\n        The entire molecule is symmetrical and has no chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive (achiral)\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a 50/50 mixture of enantiomers (a racemic mixture). Naming a specific stereoisomer implies we are considering it in its pure form. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image, which is equivalent to saying it lacks any improper axis of rotation (S_n), including a plane of symmetry (σ = S_1) and a center of inversion (i = S_2).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H from C1; a C from methyl and a C from ethyl from C2) lie in a single plane. Due to the sp2 hybridization of the carbons in the double bond, the molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name explicitly defines a single, specific stereoisomer. The designations `(3aR,7aS)` refer to the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (chiral carbons). The existence of stable enantiomers with specific R/S configurations is a hallmark of a chiral molecule. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is not a racemic mixture. A pure enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. The four groups attached to C2 are the same as the four groups attached to C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). When a molecule has two identical stereocenters, the diastereomer with opposite configurations (one R, one S) is called a meso compound. A meso compound is achiral because it has an internal element of symmetry (in this case, a center of inversion). Achiral molecules are not optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not optically active (it's a meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It has the same configuration at both stereocenters (`R,R`). This stereoisomer lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Therefore, it is chiral. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer. The name specifies a single enantiomer, (2R,3R).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring containing one double bond, with a hydroxyl group on a saturated carbon.\n    *   **Analysis:** Carbon-1 is a stereocenter because it is attached to four different groups: an -OH group, a -H atom, a -CH=CH- segment of the ring (C2-C3 path), and a -CH2-CH2- segment of the ring (C6-C5 path). The molecule as a whole lacks internal symmetry. The name `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The nomenclature `(1s,3s,5s)` indicates that all three hydroxyl groups have the same relative orientation, meaning they are all on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Analysis:** This all-cis isomer is a highly symmetric molecule. It has three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the C-H bond on the opposite carbon of the ring. A molecule with even one plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (C5H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2\n    *   **Analysis:** We must check for any stereocenters or other elements of chirality. A stereocenter is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbons:\n        *   In the cyclopentyl ring: All are CH2 groups and thus not stereocenters.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon (C=O) is sp2 hybridized and not a stereocenter.\n        *   In the butanoyl chain: The carbons at positions 1 (-C=O-), 2 (-CH2-), and 4 (the two -CH3) are not stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups (-CH3), and the rest of the chain. Since it's bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter.\n        *   The molecule has no stereocenters and no other sources of chirality (e.g., axial, planar). Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not optically active.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically active compounds: 2, 4, 5.\n*   Optically inactive compounds: 1, 3, 6, 7.\n\nThere are **3** optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nTo determine if a compound is optically active, we need to check if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs in molecules that lack a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i). Molecules with chiral centers are often chiral, but not if they are meso compounds.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   This is an alkene.

The key is the presence of stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. These indicate that the compound has defined chiral centers at positions 3a and 7a.\n    *   A specific, single stereoisomer of a molecule with chiral centers is optically active unless it is a meso compound.\n    *   The parent structure might have some symmetry, but the substituent `8-(chloromethylene)`, which is a `=CHCl` group, at position 8 and in the (E) configuration, will almost certainly break any plane of symmetry the parent bicyclic system might have had.\n    *   Given that a specific enantiomer is named, it is intended to represent a chiral molecule.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   It has two chiral centers, C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). This means we need to check for meso-possibility.\n    *   The configurations are opposite (2R, 3S). For a molecule of the type R-CH(X)-CH(X)-R, the (R,S) stereoisomer is the meso form.\n    *   Let's confirm the presence of a symmetry element. In the staggered anti-periplanar conformation, the molecule has a center of inversion (i). If you start at any atom or group and move through the midpoint of the C2-C3 bond to the other side, you find an identical atom or group.\n    *   Since it has a center of inversion, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. It has two chiral centers (C2, C3) with the same configuration (R,R).\n    *   This stereoisomer lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule.\n    *   Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer. These two form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   The question specifies the (2R,3R) isomer, which is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (C3=C4) and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   Carbon C1 is attached to four different groups: -OH, -H, -CH=CH- (the C2-C3 part of the ring), and -CH2-CH2- (the C6-C5 part of the ring). Thus, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The nomenclature `(1s,3s,5s)` typically refers to the all-cis isomer, where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring.\n    *   This highly symmetrical molecule has a C3 axis of rotation and three vertical planes of symmetry (σv).\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.

This plane contains the `C=O`, `-CH2-`, `-CH-` and the `H` on the `-CH-` group, and bisects the cyclopentyl ring and the two terminal methyl groups.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most often caused by the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers). A molecule with stereocenters can still be achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, in which case it is called a meso compound. We will examine each compound for these features.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   Structure: `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In this molecule, there are no such carbon atoms.\n    *   The carbon atoms of the double bond are sp2 hybridized. C3 is bonded to two H atoms. C4 is a methyl group. The methyl on C2 is a methyl group.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond which leads to geometric isomerism (Z/E), but it does not have any chiral centers. The molecule itself is planar. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name itself provides the stereochemistry using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (R/S) notation: `(3aR,7aS)`. This notation is used to define the absolute configuration of specific stereocenters.\n    *   When a specific enantiomer is named (e.g., with R/S descriptors), it is, by definition, chiral and therefore optically active, unless it is a meso compound.\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The designations `3aR` and `7aS` refer to two different stereocenters. For it to be a meso compound, there would have to be an element of symmetry (like a plane) that makes the molecule as a whole superimposable on its mirror image. Given the complex, non-symmetrical name and structure elements (`chloromethylene`, `methanoisobenzofuran` fused system), it is extremely unlikely to possess such symmetry. The name specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer that is not its own mirror image.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The two stereocenters are structurally equivalent (both are `CH(COOH)(CH3)`).\n    *   When a molecule has two equivalent stereocenters with opposite configurations (one R, one S), it is a meso compound. Meso compounds have an internal element of symmetry (a plane or center of inversion in one of its conformations) that makes them achiral overall, despite having stereocenters.\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is the meso isomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. It has a center of inversion in its anti-staggered conformation and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. It has two stereocenters, C2 and C3, both with the R configuration.\n    *   Its mirror image is (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image and lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Therefore, it is chiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   Let's check C1 for chirality. The four groups attached to C1 are: -OH, -H, the ring segment `-CH2-CH=` and the other ring segment `-CH2-CH2-CH=`. These four groups are different. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The specified isomer is the one where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's analyze the symmetry of this molecule. In a chair conformation where all three OH groups are axial (or all are equatorial), the molecule has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (σv).\n    *   Any molecule possessing a plane of symmetry is achiral. Since this isomer is highly symmetric, it is achiral.\n    *   In fact, the carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not true stereocenters in this isomer, because the two paths around the ring from each of these carbons are identical. The use of lowercase `s` often designates prochiral centers in an overall achiral molecule.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   Let's determine the structure from the IUPAC name.\n    *   The parent chain is `butan-1-one`: a four-carbon chain with a ketone `(=O)` at C1.\n    *   Substituents are `1-cyclopentyl` (a cyclopentyl group on C1) and `3-methyl` (a methyl group on C3).\n    *   Assembling the structure: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   This structure can also be called `cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers (carbon with four different groups).\n    *   The carbon at position 3 is `CH`. It is bonded to a `H`, a terminal `CH3` (C4), the `CH3` substituent, and the `-CH2-C(=O)-...` group. The two methyl groups attached to C3 are identical. So, C3 is not a chiral center.\n    *   There are no other sp3 carbons with four different groups in the rest of the molecule. The molecule has no chiral centers and can adopt conformations with a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary**\n\n*   Optically Active:\n    1.

This typically means the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `CH3-CH2-C(CH3)=CHCl`. A molecule with a double bond is planar in the vicinity of the double bond. This entire molecule is essentially planar and therefore possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a complex molecule, but the name provides the crucial information. The designations `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. When a compound's name includes `(R)` or `(S)` designations, it refers to a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule (unless it's a special case like a *meso* compound with pseudoasymmetric centers). This complex bicyclic structure is not symmetric, so it is not a *meso* compound. A specific enantiomer is, by definition, optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers, C2 and C3. However, the molecule is symmetric, meaning the group on C2 (`-CH(CH3)COOH`) is the same as the group on C3 (`-CH(CH3)COOH`). We need to check if the `(2R,3S)` stereoisomer has an element of symmetry. Due to the opposite configurations at the two chiral centers in a symmetric molecule, this is a *meso* compound. A *meso* compound has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry and is achiral, despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The configurations at the two chiral centers are the same `(R,R)`. This stereoisomer lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` compound. Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. Let's identify any chiral centers. Carbon C1, which bears the -OH group, is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and 4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. Since the two paths around the ring from C1 are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral. The name `(R)-...` specifies a single enantiomer, which is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name refers to the stereoisomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule is highly symmetric. In its stable chair conformation (with all three OH groups in equatorial positions), it possesses a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. We need to search for chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The carbon in the `-CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the molecule. It is not a chiral center.\n    *   None of the CH2 carbons are chiral.\n    *   In the cyclopentyl ring, the carbon attached to the carbonyl group is bonded to the `C=O` group and two identical `-CH2-` groups within the ring (the path `-CH2-CH2-` is the same in both directions). So, no carbon in the ring is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality. It is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n-   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione** (Yes)\n-   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid** (Yes)\n-   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol** (Yes)\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it will exhibit optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic (50:50) mixture of enantiomers. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This usually means the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   **Structure**: Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2, Cl, H attached to C1, C of CH₃, C of CH₂CH₃) lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule (assuming free rotation of the ethyl group or a conformation where one of its H's is in the plane). Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   **Analysis**: The IUPAC name itself provides the crucial information. The prefixes (3aR, 7aS, E) specify a single, distinct stereoisomer. The letters 'R' and 'S' are used to denote the absolute configuration at chiral centers. The existence of a name for a specific enantiomer implies that the molecule is chiral and that this particular form can be isolated. A meso compound (an achiral molecule with chiral centers) would not be named as a single R,S-isomer in this manner without it being clear that the molecule as a whole is achiral. The complexity of the structure, involving a bicyclic system and an exocyclic double bond with specified geometry (E), makes the presence of a symmetry element that would render the entire molecule achiral highly unlikely. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH.\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 (H, CH₃, COOH, and the other half of the molecule) are the same as on C3. When a molecule has two identical chiral centers with opposite configurations (one R, one S), it is a meso compound. A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and is therefore achiral. For (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, there is a center of inversion in its anti-staggered conformation and a plane of symmetry in its eclipsed conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive (it's a meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH.\n    *   **Analysis**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It has two chiral centers with the same configuration (R,R). This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is chiral. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer. Since the specific (2R,3R) enantiomer is given, it is not a racemic mixture.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   **Structure**: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   **Analysis**: The carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the -CH₂-CH= part of the ring, and (4) the -CH₂-CH₂-CH= part of the ring. Since the paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry. The name specifies the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Structure**: A cyclohexane ring with -OH groups at C1, C3, and C5. The notation (1s,3s,5s) usually implies that all three substituents are on the same side of the ring's plane (all-cis configuration).\n    *   **Analysis**: Let's imagine the three -OH groups all pointing \"up\". This molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C₃) and, more importantly, three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one of the C-OH bonds and the carbon atom opposite to it (e.g., the plane containing C1, O, H(on O), C4 and H's on C4). The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   **Structure**: (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl ring).\n    *   **Analysis**: We need to search for a chiral center. None of the carbons in the `3-methylbutanoyl` chain [ (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)- ] are chiral. The carbon in the `CH(CH₃)₂` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups. The carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are also not chiral. For example, the carbon attached to the carbonyl group is bonded to a hydrogen, the carbonyl group, and two identical `-CH₂-` groups within the ring. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains the carbonyl group and bisects the cyclopentyl ring. Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n**Summary**:\n- (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n- (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n- (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n- 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nTo determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to assess whether each molecule is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The common signs of chirality are the presence of a stereocenter (an atom bonded to four different groups) and the absence of any symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Compounds for which a specific enantiomer (e.g., using R/S notation) is named are assumed to be in that enantiomerically pure form, which will be optically active if the molecule is chiral.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule does not have any stereocenters (chiral carbons).\n    *   The plane containing the atoms of the double bond (C=C) and the atoms directly attached to them (`Cl`, `H`, `C` of methyl, `C` of ethyl) is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The IUPAC name specifies the absolute configuration at two stereocenters, `(3aR,7aS)`, and the geometry of a double bond, `(E)`.\n    *   The presence of defined stereocenters in a complex structure like this is a strong indication of chirality.

The four groups attached to C1 are: -H, -OH, -CH₂(C2)-CH=, and -CH₂(C6)-CH₂-. The two paths around the ring from C1 are different. Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The name specifies the (R)-configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This compound has three hydroxyl groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5.

Furthermore, the molecule has an accessible conformation that possesses a plane of symmetry bisecting the cyclopentyl ring and the isobutyl group. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nTo determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which of them are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups). However, the ultimate test is to look for elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i). If a molecule possesses either of these, it is achiral and thus optically inactive. A molecule that has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to a plane of symmetry or center of inversion is called a meso compound.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms of the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H on C1; C(methyl), C(ethyl) on C2) lie in a single plane.\n    *   There are no chiral centers in this molecule.\n    *   The plane containing the double bond and its substituents is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   This is a very complex name, but we can deduce its activity from the name itself.\n    *   The name includes absolute configuration descriptors: `(3aR,7aS)` for two stereocenters and `(E)` for a double bond.\n    *   The explicit designation of a single stereoisomer with specific absolute configurations (R/S) implies that the molecule is chiral and the name refers to one of the enantiomers.\n    *   An exception would be if this were a meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall. For example, `(2R,3S)-tartaric acid` is meso. This usually happens when the stereocenters are constitutionally equivalent and have opposite configurations. Here, C3a and C7a are the fusion carbons of an anhydride ring to a bicyclic system (`hexahydro-4,7-methano`), making them constitutionally equivalent in the parent dione. The `(3aR,7aS)` configuration would indeed make the parent dione a meso compound.\n    *   However, there is an additional substituent: `(E)-8-(chloromethylene)`, which is an `=CHCl` group at position 8 (the methano bridge carbon). This substituent lies on the plane of symmetry of the parent dione, but the substituent itself is not symmetric with respect to that plane. Adding this asymmetric substituent destroys the plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the entire molecule is chiral. The given name specifies one of its enantiomers. It is optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   It has two chiral centers, C2 and C3.\n    *   The designated stereoisomer is `(2R,3S)`. When a molecule has two constitutionally identical chiral centers, the `(R,S)` diastereomer (or `(S,R)`) is a meso compound.\n    *   We can draw a Newman projection or Fischer projection to confirm. A plane of symmetry exists between C2 and C3.\n    *   Since it is a meso compound, it is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The designated stereoisomer is `(2R,3R)`. This isomer is chiral. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable (they are an enantiomeric pair).\n    *   This compound has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, it is chiral and optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the ring segment `-CH2-CH=` (path towards C2), and 4) the ring segment `-CH2-CH2-CH=` (path towards C6). Since the paths around the ring from C1 are different, the four groups are different, making C1 a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry.\n    *   The name `(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol` specifies one of the two enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, it is chiral and optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This name describes a stereoisomer of cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. The `1s,3s,5s` notation, though less common than R/S, specifies a relative configuration where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's analyze the symmetry of the all-cis isomer. In a chair conformation, this molecule would exist as an equilibrium between a tri-axial form and a tri-equatorial form.\n    *   Considering a planar representation or either chair conformer, the molecule possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3), but it lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Molecules belonging to the C_n point group (for n > 1) are chiral.\n    *   Therefore, all-cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol is a chiral molecule, existing as a pair of enantiomers. The name specifies one of them. It is optically **active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. There are none. The carbon in the -CH(CH3)2 group is attached to two identical methyl groups. All carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are attached to two hydrogens or are part of a symmetrical ring relative to the point of attachment.\n    *   Let's check for a plane of symmetry. The molecule can adopt a conformation where a plane of symmetry passes through the cyclopentyl carbon attached to the carbonyl group, the carbonyl group itself, the adjacent CH2, and the CH of the isopropyl group, bisecting the cyclopentyl ring and the two methyl groups of the isopropyl group.\n    *   Since a conformer with a plane of symmetry exists and is readily accessible, the molecule is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: **Inactive**\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Inactive**\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: **Active**\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: **Inactive**\n\nThere are 4 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the optical activity of each compound. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the absence of a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   **Structure**: `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   **Analysis**: This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, CH3, C from ethyl) lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a complex, bridged polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   **Analysis**: The designation `(3aR,7aS...)` indicates that the compound is a specific stereoisomer with defined configurations at its chiral centers (3a and 7a). When a compound is named as a single stereoisomer (with R/S descriptors), it is chiral unless it is a meso compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral due to internal symmetry. However, this molecule has a substituent, `(E)-8-(chloromethylene)` which is `-C=CHCl`, on the methano bridge. This substituent is unsymmetrical and is placed on the bridge, which destroys any potential plane of symmetry that might have existed in the parent bicyclic framework. Therefore, the molecule as a whole is asymmetric.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral, and thus **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis**: This is a classic example of a meso compound. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule that has a plane of symmetry when viewed in an eclipsed conformation (in a Fischer projection) or a center of inversion in its staggered anti-periplanar conformation. The optical rotation caused by the (2R) center is cancelled internally by the opposite rotation caused by the (3S) center.\n        ```\n           COOH\n            |\n        H---C(R)---CH3\n        ----------- (plane of symmetry)\n      CH3---C(S)---H\n            |\n           COOH\n        ```\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral (meso), and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This is a diastereomer of the compound above.\n    *   **Analysis**: The `(2R,3R)` configuration does not have any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. The molecule is chiral, and its mirror image is the non-superimposable (2S,3S) isomer. These two form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral, and thus **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   **Structure**: A six-membered ring with a double bond (C3-C4) and a hydroxyl group (at C1).\n    *   **Analysis**: The name explicitly designates it as the (R) enantiomer. Carbon C1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH2-CH=, and -CH=CH-CH2-. The designation `(R)` specifies one of the two enantiomers, which is by definition chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral, and thus **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Structure**: Cyclohexane with three OH groups at C1, C3, and C5, all on the same side of the ring (cis).\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule is highly symmetrical. In its stable chair conformation with all three OH groups in equatorial positions, the molecule possesses a C3 axis of rotation and three planes of symmetry (each plane passes through a C-OH group). The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. The `s` notation (instead of R/S) is often used to denote stereogenic centers in an achiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral, and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   **Structure**: `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Analysis**: Let's search for chiral centers (a carbon with four different groups). There are none. The carbon in the `-CH(CH3)2` group is attached to two identical methyl groups. While lack of a chiral center doesn't automatically mean achiral, this molecule does possess a plane of symmetry in an accessible conformation. This plane contains the ketone's C=O group, the CH2 group, and the CH of the isopropyl group, and it bisects both the cyclopentyl ring and the two methyls of the isopropyl group.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral, and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary**:\n\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are three compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if and only if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). However, molecules can be achiral even with stereocenters if they possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion (these are called meso compounds).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond. The atoms directly involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms attached to them (Cl, H, CH3, and the first C of the ethyl group) all lie in the same plane.\n    *   A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex molecule with a rigid, bicyclic structure.\n    *   The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors: `(3aR,7aS)` and `(E)`.\n    *   The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the configuration at two stereocenters. While a molecule with multiple stereocenters can be meso (achiral), this is unlikely for such a complex and asymmetric structure. Meso compounds typically have a more symmetric substitution pattern (e.g., compound 3).\n    *   The parent structure, `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione`, can be achiral (meso). However, the substituent `8-(chloromethylene)` (a `>C=CHCl` group), attached to the framework, breaks this potential symmetry.\n    *   In general, when an IUPAC name provides specific `R/S` designations for a complex molecule, it refers to a single enantiomer of a chiral compound.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   It has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule where one half is the mirror image of the other half.

The four groups attached to C1 are: -OH, -H, the ring segment `-CH2-CH=`, and the other ring segment `-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-`.\n    *   Tracing the paths around the ring from C1, they are different: one path encounters the double bond at C3, the other encounters it at C4 (after passing through C5 and C6). Thus, the two ring connections are different groups.\n    *   Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter. A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral. The name `(R)` specifies one of the two enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This name describes the all-cis isomer of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring.\n    *   The molecule exists in two rapidly interconverting chair conformations (one with all -OH groups axial, the other with all -OH groups equatorial).\n    *   Both of these individual chair conformations are chiral (they possess a C3 axis of symmetry but no mirror plane).\n    *   However, the molecule can pass through an achiral boat conformation during the ring-flipping process. This boat conformation has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Because the two enantiomeric chair conformers can easily interconvert via an achiral intermediate conformation, the compound cannot be resolved into separate enantiomers and is considered achiral overall (functionally meso). It will not exhibit optical activity.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   Based on IUPAC conventions, the structure is cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone: `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-[cyclopentyl ring]`.\n    *   Let's check for any stereocenters. The carbon in the `(CH3)2CH` group is attached to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter. There are no other stereocenters in the chain or the unsubstituted cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters.\n    *   Furthermore, it's possible to find a conformation of this molecule that possesses a plane of symmetry.

A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of one or more stereocenters and the overall lack of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   Structure: Cl-CH=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n    *   This is an alkene. To check for chirality, we first look for stereocenters (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). There are no sp³ hybridized carbons with four different substituents, so there are no stereocenters.\n    *   Molecules without stereocenters can sometimes be chiral (e.g., allenes, atropisomers), but this simple alkene does not fall into those categories.\n    *   The molecule has a plane containing the atoms of the double bond (C1 and C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, the carbon of the methyl group, and the first carbon of the ethyl group). While the entire molecule is not perfectly planar due to the sp³ carbons in the ethyl group, it possesses a conformation with a plane of symmetry that encompasses the Cl, C1, H, C2, and the C-C-C skeleton of the butyl part. Any molecule that can adopt a conformation with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: The compound is **achiral** and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The IUPAC name itself provides the answer. The descriptors (3aR, 7aS) specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters, C-3a and C-7a. The (E) describes the geometry of the double bond in the chloromethylene (=CHCl) group.\n    *   Naming a compound with specific R/S descriptors for its stereocenters indicates that the compound is chiral and this name refers to a single, specific enantiomer (or diastereomer). A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active by definition.\n    *   Although some molecules with R and S stereocenters can be achiral (meso compounds), this only occurs if the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. In this complex bicyclic molecule, the two stereocenters, C-3a and C-7a, are in chemically different environments (one is part of an anhydride ring adjacent to two carbonyls, the other is adjacent to a furan-like oxygen). The molecule is inherently asymmetric, and the additional substituent at position 8 further ensures the lack of symmetry.\n    *   Conclusion: The compound is **chiral**, and as a specific stereoisomer is given, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   Structure: HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are H, CH₃, COOH, and the -CH(CH₃)COOH group. The substituents on C3 are also H, CH₃, COOH, and the other chiral group. The two stereocenters are constitutionally equivalent.\n    *   This allows for the existence of a meso-compound.

The four different groups attached to it are: -OH, -H, the ring segment -CH₂-CH=, and the other ring segment -CH₂-CH₂-. The two paths around the ring are different because one immediately encounters the double bond.\n    *   The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Conclusion: The compound is **chiral** and, as the (R)-enantiomer, is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.

The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers). However, a molecule with stereocenters can still be achiral if it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Such compounds are called meso compounds.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   This is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This plane of the molecule is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The IUPAC name provides specific stereochemical descriptors: (3aR, 7aS) for stereocenters and (E) for the double bond geometry.\n    *   The naming of a specific stereoisomer with R/S and E/Z notation indicates that we are dealing with a single, defined isomer.\n    *   A specific stereoisomer is optically active unless it happens to be a meso compound. A meso compound must have internal symmetry. While the core structure might possess symmetry, the combination of multiple stereocenters (`3aR,7aS`) and an unsymmetrically placed substituent (`(E)-8-(chloromethylene)`) makes it extremely unlikely for the molecule as a whole to possess a plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the rest of the molecule).\n    *   For a molecule with two identical stereocenters, the (R,S) and (S,R) combination results in a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it achiral despite having chiral centers. This can be visualized in a Newman projection which shows a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is a meso compound, which is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso form discussed above.\n    *   The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid are enantiomers. They are chiral and non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n    *   Since (2R,3R) is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and a hydroxyl group on C1.\n    *   Carbon-1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, -CH2-CH=CH- (path around the ring one way), and -CH2-CH2-CH= (path around the ring the other way).\n    *   Therefore, C1 is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. The name specifies the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This nomenclature usually refers to the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's consider the chair conformation. The all-cis isomer can have all three OH groups in axial positions or all three in equatorial positions.\n    *   In either conformation, the molecule possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry (σv) that pass through each C-OH bond.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. This is also known as cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone.\n    *   Let's search for chiral centers. No carbon atom is bonded to four different groups. For example, C3 of the butanoyl chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups.\n    *   The molecule also has no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). It can adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry. This plane would contain the C=O group and can be aligned with symmetry planes within the isobutyl and cyclopentyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically active: #2, #4, #5\n*   Not optically active: #1, #3, #6, #7\n\nThere are **3** optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nAn optically active compound is a chiral compound that can rotate the plane of polarized light. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature causing chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups). However, a molecule with chiral centers can be achiral if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion (such molecules are called meso compounds). We will analyze each compound to determine its chirality.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   This molecule does not contain any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). All carbon atoms are either sp2 hybridized (part of the double bond) or are bonded to at least two identical groups (e.g., C3 is a CH2 group).\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry. The plane containing the C=C double bond and the atoms attached to it (Cl, H, C of methyl, C of ethyl) is a plane of symmetry for the molecule if the ethyl group is oriented correctly.\n    *   Since it is achiral, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides the crucial information.\n    *   The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)` and `(E)` specify a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   The designation of absolute configurations like `(R)` or `(S)` means that there are chiral centers in the molecule.\n    *   When a specific enantiomer is named (e.g., using R/S notation) and it's not a meso compound, it refers to a pure chiral substance. A pure enantiomer is, by definition, optically active. Although the parent structure without the substituent might be meso, the substituent destroys any symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as `(2R, 3S)`. This is a classic example of a meso compound. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond, making one half of the molecule the mirror image of the other.\n    *   Due to this internal symmetry, the molecule is achiral despite having two chiral centers.\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound, with the configuration `(2R, 3R)`.\n    *   In this configuration, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the `(2S, 3S)` enantiomer.\n    *   Since it is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group on C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -H, (2) -OH, (3) -CH2-CH2- (C2 and part of the ring), and (4) -CH=CH- (C6 and part of the ring). These four groups are different.\n    *   Thus, C1 is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Whether in the chair conformation with all OH groups axial or all equatorial, this molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a threefold rotational axis (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through a C-OH bond and the opposite carbon atom.\n    *   Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butanone chain is bonded to a hydrogen, a `-CH2-CO-cyclopentyl` group, and two identical methyl (`-CH3`) groups. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   No other atom in the molecule is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule does not have any other source of chirality like axial or planar chirality. It is flexible and possesses conformations with a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary**:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the optical activity of each compound. A compound is optically active if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This is typically due to the presence of a chiral center and the absence of any internal elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH2-C(CH3)=CH-Cl`.\n    *   The carbon-carbon double bond (`C=C`) and the atoms directly attached to it lie in the same plane. The entire molecule is planar.\n    *   Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), making it achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name itself provides the key information. The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (the bridgehead carbons 3a and 7a).\n    *   The core structure, `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione`, is a norbornane skeleton fused with a cyclic anhydride ring. This parent structure has a plane of symmetry that passes through the methano bridge carbon (C8).\n    *   However, the substituent at C8 is an unsymmetrical chloromethylene group (`=CHCl`). This substituent destroys the plane of symmetry of the parent molecule.\n    *   Since the molecule has stereocenters and lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, it is chiral.\n    *   The name refers to a single, specific enantiomer. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group).\n    *   When a molecule has two identical stereocenters with opposite configurations (one R, one S), it is a *meso* compound.\n    *   *Meso* compounds are achiral because they possess an internal element of symmetry. In this case, there is a center of inversion halfway between C2 and C3. An eclipsed conformation also shows a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Because it is a meso compound, it is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It has two identical stereocenters, both with the (R) configuration.\n    *   Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers).\n    *   This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Since it is a chiral molecule, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group on C1.\n    *   Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -H, (2) -OH, (3) the ring segment `-CH2-CH=` and (4) the ring segment `-CH2-CH2-CH=`. These two pathways around the ring are different. Thus, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor `(1s,3s,5s)` implies that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's consider the chair conformation. The all-cis isomer can exist in two chair forms that interconvert: one with all three -OH groups in axial positions, and one with all three in equatorial positions.\n    *   Both conformers possess multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one C-OH group and the opposite C-H group, bisecting the ring. The molecule also possesses a C3 axis of rotation.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral, regardless of the conformation.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   Structure: `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. The molecule is also known as cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. A chiral center must be a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   None of the carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are chiral.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2-hybridized and not a chiral center.\n    *   The -CH2- group has two identical hydrogen atoms and is not a chiral center.\n    *   The -CH(CH3)2 carbon is bonded to a hydrogen and two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. It also does not exhibit other types of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). Furthermore, the molecule has accessible conformations that possess a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nTo determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which of them are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks any improper axis of rotation (Sn), which includes planes of symmetry (σ, which is S1) and centers of inversion (i, which is S2).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure**: Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule does not have a chiral center (a carbon atom with four different substituents). While the double bond has a specific (Z) geometry, the molecule as a whole is achiral. It possesses a plane of symmetry in at least one of its conformations (considering the freely rotating ethyl group), and its mirror image is superimposable on the original. For example, reflection across the plane of the molecule followed by a 180° rotation around an axis perpendicular to the plane results in the original molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral, thus optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   **Analysis**: The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` indicate the presence of chiral centers with a specific absolute configuration. The `(E)` descriptor defines the stereochemistry of an exocyclic double bond. A molecule given as a specific enantiomer (with R/S descriptors) is, by definition, chiral unless it happens to be a meso compound. The complex and asymmetric nature of the molecule, particularly with the addition of an asymmetric substituent (`=CH-Cl`), makes it virtually certain that there is no internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral, thus optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure**: HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). The substituents on both centers are identical (H, CH₃, COOH). The stereochemical configuration is `(2R,3S)`. When a molecule has multiple stereocenters with identical substitution patterns and an R,S configuration (or S,R), it is a meso compound. Meso compounds have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion that makes them achiral despite having chiral centers. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3 when viewed in its eclipsed conformation (and in its Fischer projection).\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral (meso), thus optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure**: HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis**: This is a diastereomer of the compound above. It has the configuration `(2R,3R)`. This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral, thus optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure**: A six-membered ring with a C=C double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group on C1.\n    *   **Analysis**: The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the ring segment `-CH₂-CH=`, and 4) the ring segment `-CH₂-CH₂-CH=`. Because the paths around the ring from C1 are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule is named with the `(R)` descriptor, indicating it is a specific enantiomer. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral, thus optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure**: A cyclohexane ring with -OH groups at C1, C3, and C5. The `1s,3s,5s` notation implies that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule, with its high symmetry, is achiral. It has no chiral centers because the two paths around the ring from any of the substituted carbons (C1, C3, or C5) are identical. The molecule as a whole possesses several symmetry elements, including a C₃ axis of rotation and three vertical planes of symmetry (σᵥ), each passing through a C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bond. The presence of these planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral, thus optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure**: (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-cyclopentyl\n    *   **Analysis**: We examine the molecule for chiral centers. The carbon atom `CH(CH₃)₂` is attached to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. No carbon atom in the cyclopentyl ring is chiral either. The molecule as a whole is achiral because it can adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry. This plane contains the C=O group, the CH₂ group, the CH group, and bisects the two methyl groups as well as the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral, thus optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically active (chiral) compounds:\n    *   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    *   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Optically inactive (achiral) compounds:\n    *   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    *   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
