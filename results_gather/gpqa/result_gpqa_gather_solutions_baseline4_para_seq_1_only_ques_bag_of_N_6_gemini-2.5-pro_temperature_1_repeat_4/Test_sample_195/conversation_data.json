Identify the relevant physical principles:**\nThe problem involves a relativistic object moving under the influence of a conservative force (from a spring, obeying Hooke's Law). The key principle to use is the conservation of energy. In special relativity, the total energy of a particle must be considered.\n\n**2. Define the energy components:**\n*   **Relativistic Kinetic Energy (K):** For a particle of rest mass `m` moving at speed `v`, the kinetic energy is given by `K = (γ - 1)mc²`, where `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ` is the Lorentz factor and `c` is the speed of light.\n*   **Potential Energy (U):** The force is given by Hooke's Law, `F = -kx`. The potential energy `U(x)` is the negative integral of the force with respect to position:\n    `U(x) = -∫ F dx = -∫ (-kx) dx = (1/2)kx²`. We set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position (`x=0`).\n\n**3. Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy:**\nIn a conservative system, the total mechanical energy `E_mech` is conserved. The total mechanical energy is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy.\n`E_mech = K + U = (γ - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx² = constant`\n\n**4. Analyze the system at two key points:**\nWe need to evaluate the total energy at two specific points in the oscillator's motion:\n*   **Point 1: At maximum amplitude (x = A):**\n    At the point of maximum displacement, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction. Therefore, its speed is zero (`v = 0`).\n    When `v = 0`, the Lorentz factor `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0²/c²) = 1`.\n    The kinetic energy `K = (1 - 1)mc² = 0`.\n    The potential energy is at its maximum: `U(A) = (1/2)kA²`.\n    The total energy at this point is `E_mech = 0 + (1/2)kA² = (1/2)kA²`.\n\n*   **Point 2: At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n    As the mass passes through the equilibrium position, its potential energy is zero, and its speed is at its maximum (`v = v_max`).\n    The kinetic energy is `K = (γ_max - 1)mc²`, where `γ_max = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)`.\n    The potential energy is `U(0) = (1/2)k(0)² = 0`.\n    The total energy at this point is `E_mech = (γ_max - 1)mc² + 0 = (γ_max - 1)mc²`.\n\n**5. Equate the energies and solve for v_max:**\nSince energy is conserved, the total energy at Point 1 must equal the total energy at Point 2.\n`(γ_max - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA²`\n\nNow, we solve this equation for `v_max`. First, isolate `γ_max`:\n`γ_max - 1 = (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n`γ_max = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n\nNext, substitute the definition of `γ_max`:\n`1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for `v_max`. Let's invert both sides:\n`sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))`\n\nSquare both sides:\n`1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²`\n\nIsolate the `v_max²/c²` term:\n`v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²`\n\nFinally, multiply by `c²` and take the square root to find `v_max`:\n`v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²)`\n\n**6. Compare with the given options:**\nThe derived expression for `v_max` is:\n`v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}`\n\nThis matches option D exactly.\n\n**Alternative approach using total relativistic energy:**\nOne can also define the total conserved energy as `E_total = γmc² + U(x)`.\n*   At `x=A`, `v=0`, `γ=1`: `E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA²`.\n*   At `x=0`, `v=v_max`, `U=0`: `E_total = γ_max mc²`.\nEquating these gives `γ_max mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA²`, which simplifies to `(γ_max - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA²`, the same equation as before, yielding the same result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    In a conservative system like a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is constant. We need to find the correct expression for energy in a relativistic context.\n\n2.  **Define the total energy of the relativistic system.**\n    The total energy (Hamiltonian) of a relativistic particle of rest mass $m$ and speed $v$ moving in a potential $U(x)$ is given by:\n    $E = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n    where:\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   $mc^2$ is the rest energy.\n    *   $\\gamma mc^2$ is the total relativistic energy of the free particle.\n    *   $U(x)$ is the potential energy.\n\n    For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    So, the conserved total energy of the system is:\n    $E = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of energy at two key points of the motion.**\n    The total energy $E$ must be the same at every point in the particle's trajectory. We will evaluate $E$ at the point of maximum displacement (the amplitude) and at the equilibrium position.\n\n    *   **At the maximum amplitude (x = A):**\n        The particle momentarily stops, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n        At this point, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        The total energy is:\n        $E = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n        The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n        The speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        The Lorentz factor is at its maximum: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The total energy is:\n        $E = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n4.  **Equate the expressions for total energy.**\n    Since energy is conserved, the total energy at the maximum amplitude is equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $E(\\text{at } x=A) = E(\\text{at } x=0)$\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$.**\n    First, solve for $\\gamma_{max}$ by dividing the equation by $mc^2$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To isolate $v_{max}$, we perform the following algebraic steps:\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n    *   Invert both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Rearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root:\n        $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n    $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n    This exactly matches option (C).\n\n*Alternative Check (using Relativistic Work-Energy Theorem):*\nThe work done by the spring force as the mass moves from the amplitude (x=A) to the center (x=0) is equal to the change in its relativistic kinetic energy $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$.\nWork $W = \\int_A^0 F dx = \\int_A^0 (-kx) dx = -k[\\frac{x^2}{2}]_A^0 = -k(0 - \\frac{A^2}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\nChange in kinetic energy $\\Delta K = K_{final} - K_{initial} = K(\\text{at } x=0) - K(\\text{at } x=A)$.\n$K(\\text{at } x=0) = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n$K(\\text{at } x=A) = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0$.\nSo, $\\Delta K = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\nEquating work and change in kinetic energy:\n$\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n$\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$.\nThis is the same equation obtained from the conservation of energy, and it leads to the same final answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed $v_{max}$ of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    The total energy of the system is conserved. The system consists of the oscillating mass and the spring (or the potential field it creates). The total energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the potential energy stored in the spring.\n\n2.  **Write down the expressions for the energy components.**\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle of mass $m$ moving with speed $v$ is given by $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor. This energy includes the rest mass energy $mc^2$.\n    *   The potential energy of a spring obeying Hooke's law ($F=-kx$) when stretched or compressed by a distance $x$ from its equilibrium position is $U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n    Therefore, the total conserved energy of the system at any point in time is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of energy to two key points in the oscillation.**\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum displacement (amplitude).**\n        At the maximum amplitude, the displacement is $x = A$. The mass momentarily comes to a stop, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n        At this point, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The total energy of the system is:\n        $E_{total, A} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium position.**\n        At the equilibrium position, the displacement is $x = 0$. The potential energy is zero, and the speed of the mass is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        At this point, the Lorentz factor takes its maximum value, $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The total energy of the system is:\n        $E_{total, 0} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n4.  **Equate the total energy at these two points.**\n    Since energy is conserved, $E_{total, A} = E_{total, 0}$.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for $v_{max}$.**\n    First, let's solve for $\\gamma_{max}$.

Understand the System and Principles**\nWe are dealing with a harmonic oscillator, but the speeds can be comparable to the speed of light, so we must use the principles of special relativity. The key principle is the conservation of total energy.\n\n**2. Define the Total Energy in a Relativistic System**\nThe total energy ($E_{total}$) of a particle in a potential field is the sum of its rest energy ($E_0$), its relativistic kinetic energy ($K$), and its potential energy ($U$).\n\n*   Rest Energy: $E_0 = mc^2$\n*   Relativistic Kinetic Energy: $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   Total Relativistic Energy of a free particle is $E = E_0 + K = mc^2 + (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \\gamma mc^2$.\n*   Potential Energy for a harmonic oscillator (from Hooke's Law, $F=-kx$): $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\nSo, the total conserved energy of the relativistic harmonic oscillator at any point in its motion is:\n$E_{total} = (\\text{Rest Energy} + \\text{Kinetic Energy}) + \\text{Potential Energy}$\n$E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n$E_{total} = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy**\nThe total energy $E_{total}$ must be the same at all points during the oscillation. We can find the value of this constant energy by looking at a specific point. The most convenient point is the maximum displacement (amplitude), where the velocity is zero.\n\n*   **At maximum displacement (x = A):**\n    The mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n    This means the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    The potential energy is maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    The total energy is:\n    $E_{total} = (1) \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\nNow we have the constant total energy of the system.\n\n**4. Analyze the point of Maximum Speed**\nThe speed is maximum when the mass passes through the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n\n*   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n    The speed is maximum, so we denote it as $v = v_{max}$.\n    The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n**5. Equate the Energies and Solve for v_max**\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at the maximum displacement is equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n\n$E_{total}(\\text{at } x=A) = E_{total}(\\text{at } x=0)$\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$.\nFirst, divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n$1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\nNext, invert both sides to isolate the square root term:\n$\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\nSquare both sides:\n$1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n$\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\nFinally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n$v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n**6.

Identify the Physical Principles\n\nThe problem involves a harmonic oscillator at relativistic speeds. The key principle to use is the **conservation of energy**. In relativistic mechanics, the total energy of a particle is not just its kinetic energy but includes its rest energy.\n\n### 2. Define the Total Relativistic Energy of the System\n\nFor a particle of rest mass $m$ moving with velocity $v$ in a potential $U(x)$, the total conserved energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy:\n$E_{total} = E_{relativistic} + U(x)$\n\nThe relativistic energy of the particle is given by $E_{relativistic} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\nThe potential energy for a harmonic oscillator (obeying Hooke's Law, $F=-kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\nSo, the conserved total energy for the relativistic harmonic oscillator is:\n$E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n### 3.

The potential energy is zero, and the mass reaches its maximum speed, $v = v_{max}$.\n    The Lorentz factor at this speed is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n### 4. Set up and Solve the Energy Conservation Equation\n\nSince energy is conserved, the total energy at Point 1 is equal to the total energy at Point 2:\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\nNow, substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} mc^2$\n\nOur goal is to solve this equation for $v_{max}$.\n\n1.  Divide the entire equation by $mc^2$ (assuming $m \\neq 0$ and $c \\neq 0$):\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n2.  To isolate $v_{max}$, we rearrange the equation to solve for the square root term. Take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n3.  Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n4.  Rearrange the equation to isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n5.  Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max}^2 = c^2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} \\right)$\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n### 5.

Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe problem involves a conservative force (the spring force), so the total energy of the system is conserved. The system consists of the mass and the potential energy stored in the spring.\n\nThe total energy of the system, $E_{sys}$, is the sum of the relativistic energy of the mass and the potential energy of the spring:\n$E_{sys} = E_{mass} + U(x)$\n\nThe relativistic energy of the mass is given by $E_{mass} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $m$ is the rest mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\nThe potential energy stored in the spring is given by Hooke's Law: $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\n**2.

Energy at Equilibrium Position (x = 0)**\n\nThe mass reaches its maximum speed, $v_{max}$, when it passes through the equilibrium position, $x = 0$.\n*   The displacement is $x = 0$.\n*   The potential energy stored in the spring is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n*   The velocity of the mass is $v = v_{max}$.\n*   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n*   The energy of the mass is at its maximum: $E_{mass, 0} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\nSo, the total energy of the system at this point is:\n$E_{sys} = E_{mass, 0} + U(0) = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n**4. Equating the Energies and Solving for v_max**\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at the maximum amplitude must equal the total energy at the equilibrium position:\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$.\nFirst, solve for $\\gamma_{max}$ by dividing the entire equation by $mc^2$:\n$\\frac{mc^2}{mc^2} + \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\gamma_{max}mc^2}{mc^2}$\n$1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max}$\n\nNow, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n$1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\nTo isolate $v_{max}$, we square both sides of the equation:\n$(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n\nNext, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$\\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for the term with $v_{max}$:\n$\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\nFinally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n$v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n**Non-relativistic Check:**\nIn the classical limit where the speed is much less than $c$, the term $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$ is very small.

The system is the mass under the influence of the spring force.\n2.  **Relativistic Energy:** In relativistic mechanics, the total energy of a particle is not just its kinetic energy. A consistent formulation for the conserved total energy of a particle in a potential field is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy.\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v$ is $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light. This energy includes both the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($K = (\\gamma-1)mc^2$).\n    *   The potential energy of a mass attached to a spring obeying Hooke's Law ($F = -kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where we set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n3.  **Total Conserved Energy:** The total conserved energy ($E_{total}$) of the system is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and its potential energy:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    This quantity remains constant throughout the oscillation.\n4.  **Analyze Two Key Points in the Oscillation:** We can find the value of this constant total energy by analyzing the system at a point where we know all the variables.

The total energy `E` of the oscillating mass is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy `U(x)`. The relativistic energy itself is composed of the rest energy (`mc^2`) and the relativistic kinetic energy (`(γ - 1)mc^2`).\nTherefore, the total energy can be expressed as:\n`E = γmc^2 + U(x)`\nwhere:\n*   `m` is the rest mass of the oscillator.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `v` is the instantaneous speed of the mass.\n*   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)` is the Lorentz factor.\n*   `U(x)` is the potential energy at position `x`.\n\nFor a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law (`F = -kx`), the potential energy stored in the spring is given by `U(x) = (1/2)kx^2`, assuming `U(0) = 0`.\n\nSo, the conservation of energy equation is:\n`E_total = γmc^2 + (1/2)kx^2 = constant`\n\n**2. Identify Key Points in the Oscillation**\n\nWe can analyze the energy of the system at two extreme points of the motion:\n\n*   **Point 1: Maximum Amplitude (x = A)**\n    *   At the maximum amplitude, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction.\n    *   The speed `v = 0`.\n    *   The Lorentz factor `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0^2/c^2) = 1`.\n    *   The potential energy is maximum: `U(A) = (1/2)kA^2`.\n    *   The total energy at this point is `E_total = (1)mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2 = mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2`.\n\n*   **Point 2: Equilibrium Position (x = 0)**\n    *   At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero (`U(0) = 0`).\n    *   The kinetic energy, and therefore the speed, is at its maximum. Let's call this maximum speed `v_max`.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is at its maximum: `γ_max = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2)`.\n    *   The total energy at this point is `E_total = γ_max * mc^2 + 0 = γ_max * mc^2`.\n\n**3. Equate the Energies and Solve for v_max**\n\nSince the total energy is conserved, the energy at Point 1 must equal the energy at Point 2:\n`mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2 = γ_max * mc^2`\n\nNow, we solve this equation for `v_max`. First, let's isolate `γ_max`:\n`γ_max = (mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2) / (mc^2)`\n`γ_max = 1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2)`\n\nNext, substitute the definition of `γ_max`:\n`1 / sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2)`\n\nNow, solve for `v_max`. Let's invert both sides:\n`sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))`\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate the square root:\n`1 - v_max^2/c^2 = 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))^2`\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for `v_max^2/c^2`:\n`v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))^2`\n\nFinally, multiply by `c^2` and take the square root to find `v_max`:\n`v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))^2)`\n\nThis expression matches option C.\n\n**4. Check for Classical Limit**\n\nAs a sanity check, let's see if this relativistic formula reduces to the classical formula when `c` is very large (`c -> ∞`). In this limit, the term `(kA^2) / (2mc^2)` becomes very small.\nLet `x = (kA^2) / (2mc^2)`.\n`v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - (1 + x)^-2`\nUsing the binomial approximation `(1+x)^n ≈ 1 + nx` for small `x`:\n`v_max^2/c^2 ≈ 1 - (1 - 2x) = 2x`\n`v_max^2/c^2 ≈ 2 * [(kA^2) / (2mc^2)]`\n`v_max^2/c^2 ≈ kA^2 / (mc^2)`\n`v_max^2 ≈ kA^2 / m`\n`v_max ≈ sqrt(kA^2 / m)`\nThis is the well-known classical result, which confirms that our relativistic derivation is correct.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nThis problem requires us to apply the principle of conservation of energy in the context of special relativity.

Solve for the Maximum Speed (v_max)**\n\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at Point 1 is equal to the total energy at Point 2:\n\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\nNow, we algebraïcally solve this equation for $v_{max}$:\n\n1.  Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n2.  Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    $\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n\n3.  Take the reciprocal of both sides to isolate the term with $v_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n\n4.  Rearrange the equation to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n5.  Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe derived expression matches option C. As a quick check, this formula is physically sound because the term $\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$ is always greater than 1 (for A > 0), which means the fraction is between 0 and 1, and the entire expression under the square root is between 0 and 1.

Principle of Conservation of Energy\n\nThe problem involves a conservative force (Hook's law), so the total energy of the system is conserved. In relativistic mechanics, the total energy ($E$) of a particle with mass $m$ and speed $v$ under a potential $U(x)$ is given by:\n$E = K + E_0 + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\nwhere:\n*   $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$ is the relativistic kinetic energy.\n*   $E_0 = mc^2$ is the rest energy.\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ is the potential energy of the spring.\n\nThe total energy $E$ remains constant throughout the oscillation.\n\n### 2. Identify Key Points in the Oscillation\n\nWe need to relate the state of the oscillator at its maximum displacement to its state at the equilibrium position.\n\n*   **At maximum displacement (amplitude):**\n    *   The position is $x = A$.\n    *   The mass is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n    *   Since $v=0$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0}} = 1$.\n    *   The potential energy is maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy at this point ($E_1$) is:\n        $E_1 = \\gamma mc^2 + U(A) = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n*   **At the equilibrium position:**\n    *   The position is $x = 0$.\n    *   The speed is maximum: $v = v_{max}$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    *   The total energy at this point ($E_2$) is:\n        $E_2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + U(0) = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n### 3. Apply Energy Conservation\n\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at both points must be equal:\n$E_1 = E_2$\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\nAn alternative way to think about this is using the work-energy theorem. The work done by the spring force when the mass moves from $x=A$ to $x=0$ is equal to the change in its kinetic energy.\nWork done by spring $W = \\int_A^0 F dx = \\int_A^0 (-kx) dx = [-\\frac{1}{2}kx^2]_A^0 = 0 - (-\\frac{1}{2}kA^2) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\nChange in kinetic energy $\\Delta K = K_{final} - K_{initial} = K(v_{max}) - K(0)$.\n$K(v_{max}) = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n$K(0) = (\\gamma(v=0)-1)mc^2 = (1-1)mc^2 = 0$.\nSo, $\\Delta K = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\nEquating work and change in kinetic energy:\n$\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\nThis equation can be rearranged to $\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$, which is the same as the energy conservation equation.\n\n### 4. Solve for $v_{max}$\n\nLet's proceed from the equation derived from energy conservation:\n$\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\nDivide the entire equation by $mc^2$:\n$\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\nNow, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\nTo solve for $v_{max}$, we need to isolate it. First, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\nSquare both sides:\n$1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\nRearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n$\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\nFinally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root:\n$v_{max}^2 = c^2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2} \\right)$\n$v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n### 5.

Define the System and Conservation of Energy\n\nWe consider a particle of rest mass $m$ subject to a harmonic potential. The total energy $E_{total}$ of a relativistic particle in a potential field $U(x)$ is the sum of its relativistic energy and potential energy.

Note that the relativistic energy includes the rest energy $mc^2$.\n\nThe force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy $U(x)$ is obtained by integrating the negative of the force with respect to position:\n$U(x) = -\\int_0^x F(x') dx' = -\\int_0^x (-kx') dx' = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\nThe total conserved energy of the system is:\n$E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n### 2.

At this point, the potential energy is zero, $U(0) = 0$.\n    The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The total energy is:\n    $E_{total, 2} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + U(0) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation of Energy and Solve for v_max\n\nSince energy is conserved, $E_{total, 1} = E_{total, 2}$.\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$:\n\n1.  Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n\n2.  To isolate the square root term, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$.\n\n3.  Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$.\n\n4.

Physics Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator. The key principle is the **conservation of total energy**. The total energy of the system ($E_{total}$) is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy ($E_{particle}$) and its potential energy ($U(x)$).\n\n1.  **Energy Components:**\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle with mass $m$ and speed $v$ is $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor. This term includes both the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($(\\gamma-1)mc^2$).\n    *   The potential energy of a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's Law ($F=-kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n2.  **Total Conserved Energy:** The total energy of the system at any point in its motion is:\n    $E_{total} = E_{particle} + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    This quantity is conserved.\n\n3.  **Analyze Two Key Points:**\n    *   **At maximum amplitude (x=A):** The mass is momentarily at rest, so $v=0$. The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = 1$. The total energy is:\n        $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position (x=0):** The potential energy is zero ($U=0$) and the speed is maximum ($v=v_{max}$). The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$. The total energy is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n4.  **Apply Energy Conservation:**\n    Equating the total energy at these two points:\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for $v_{max}$:**\n    First, solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ and solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    $\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis derived formula exactly matches **Option B** from the prompt.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Candidate Answer Consistency\n\nI will now evaluate the provided candidate answers based on the correct derivation above.\n\n*   **Physical Reasoning:** A thorough review shows that virtually all 60 candidate answers correctly implement the principle of energy conservation. They all use either the \"total relativistic energy\" formulation ($E = \\gamma mc^2 + U$) or the \"relativistic kinetic energy\" formulation ($E_{mech} = K_{rel} + U$). Both approaches are valid and lead to the identical correct expression for $v_{max}$. Therefore, the underlying physics and mathematical steps in the derivations are highly consistent across almost all answers.\n\n*   **Conclusion Consistency:** The primary source of inconsistency is the final step, where the derived formula is matched to one of the multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D).\n    *   A significant group of answers (e.g., Answer 3, 7, 15, 20, 25, 28, 30, 46, 49, 59) correctly derive the formula, correctly identify it as **Option B**, and correctly conclude by returning `<<<B>>>`. These answers are completely consistent from start to finish.\n    *   Other large groups of answers also perform the correct derivation, but then make an error in the final step. They incorrectly claim their result matches option A, C, or D, and return that incorrect letter. These answers are internally inconsistent because their reasoning contradicts their final conclusion. This is likely due to a scrambling of the option labels during the generation process for those specific answers.\n\n### 3. Final Determination\n\nThe \"most consistent\" answer is the one for which the reasoning is sound and logically leads to the final conclusion. The correct derivation consistently leads to the formula in Option B.

The key principle to use is the conservation of energy. In special relativity, the total energy of a particle must be considered.\n\n**2. Define the energy components:**\n*   **Relativistic Kinetic Energy (K):** For a particle of rest mass `m` moving at speed `v`, the kinetic energy is given by `K = (γ - 1)mc²`, where `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ` is the Lorentz factor and `c` is the speed of light.\n*   **Potential Energy (U):** The force is given by Hooke's Law, `F = -kx`. The potential energy `U(x)` is the negative integral of the force with respect to position:\n    `U(x) = -∫ F dx = -∫ (-kx) dx = (1/2)kx²`. We set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position (`x=0`).\n\n**3. Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy:**\nIn a conservative system, the total mechanical energy `E_mech` is conserved. The total mechanical energy is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy.\n`E_mech = K + U = (γ - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx² = constant`\n\n**4. Analyze the system at two key points:**\nWe need to evaluate the total energy at two specific points in the oscillator's motion:\n*   **Point 1: At maximum amplitude (x = A):**\n    At the point of maximum displacement, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction. Therefore, its speed is zero (`v = 0`).\n    When `v = 0`, the Lorentz factor `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0²/c²) = 1`.\n    The kinetic energy `K = (1 - 1)mc² = 0`.\n    The potential energy is at its maximum: `U(A) = (1/2)kA²`.\n    The total energy at this point is `E_mech = 0 + (1/2)kA² = (1/2)kA²`.\n\n*   **Point 2: At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n    As the mass passes through the equilibrium position, its potential energy is zero, and its speed is at its maximum (`v = v_max`).\n    The kinetic energy is `K = (γ_max - 1)mc²`, where `γ_max = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)`.\n    The potential energy is `U(0) = (1/2)k(0)² = 0`.\n    The total energy at this point is `E_mech = (γ_max - 1)mc² + 0 = (γ_max - 1)mc²`.\n\n**5. Equate the energies and solve for v_max:**\nSince energy is conserved, the total energy at Point 1 must equal the total energy at Point 2.\n`(γ_max - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA²`\n\nNow, we solve this equation for `v_max`. First, isolate `γ_max`:\n`γ_max - 1 = (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n`γ_max = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n\nNext, substitute the definition of `γ_max`:\n`1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for `v_max`. Let's invert both sides:\n`sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))`\n\nSquare both sides:\n`1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²`\n\nIsolate the `v_max²/c²` term:\n`v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²`\n\nFinally, multiply by `c²` and take the square root to find `v_max`:\n`v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²)`\n\n**6. Compare with the given options:**\nThe derived expression for `v_max` is:\n`v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}`\n\nThis matches option D exactly.\n\n**Alternative approach using total relativistic energy:**\nOne can also define the total conserved energy as `E_total = γmc² + U(x)`.\n*   At `x=A`, `v=0`, `γ=1`: `E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA²`.\n*   At `x=0`, `v=v_max`, `U=0`: `E_total = γ_max mc²`.\nEquating these gives `γ_max mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA²`, which simplifies to `(γ_max - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA²`, the same equation as before, yielding the same result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    In a conservative system like a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is constant. We need to find the correct expression for energy in a relativistic context.\n\n2.  **Define the total energy of the relativistic system.**\n    The total energy (Hamiltonian) of a relativistic particle of rest mass $m$ and speed $v$ moving in a potential $U(x)$ is given by:\n    $E = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n    where:\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   $mc^2$ is the rest energy.\n    *   $\\gamma mc^2$ is the total relativistic energy of the free particle.\n    *   $U(x)$ is the potential energy.\n\n    For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    So, the conserved total energy of the system is:\n    $E = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of energy at two key points of the motion.**\n    The total energy $E$ must be the same at every point in the particle's trajectory. We will evaluate $E$ at the point of maximum displacement (the amplitude) and at the equilibrium position.\n\n    *   **At the maximum amplitude (x = A):**\n        The particle momentarily stops, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n        At this point, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        The total energy is:\n        $E = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n        The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n        The speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        The Lorentz factor is at its maximum: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The total energy is:\n        $E = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n4.  **Equate the expressions for total energy.**\n    Since energy is conserved, the total energy at the maximum amplitude is equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $E(\\text{at } x=A) = E(\\text{at } x=0)$\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$.**\n    First, solve for $\\gamma_{max}$ by dividing the equation by $mc^2$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To isolate $v_{max}$, we perform the following algebraic steps:\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n    *   Invert both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Rearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root:\n        $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n    $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n    This exactly matches option (C).\n\n*Alternative Check (using Relativistic Work-Energy Theorem):*\nThe work done by the spring force as the mass moves from the amplitude (x=A) to the center (x=0) is equal to the change in its relativistic kinetic energy $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$.\nWork $W = \\int_A^0 F dx = \\int_A^0 (-kx) dx = -k[\\frac{x^2}{2}]_A^0 = -k(0 - \\frac{A^2}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\nChange in kinetic energy $\\Delta K = K_{final} - K_{initial} = K(\\text{at } x=0) - K(\\text{at } x=A)$.\n$K(\\text{at } x=0) = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n$K(\\text{at } x=A) = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0$.\nSo, $\\Delta K = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\nEquating work and change in kinetic energy:\n$\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n$\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$.\nThis is the same equation obtained from the conservation of energy, and it leads to the same final answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed $v_{max}$ of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    The total energy of the system is conserved. The system consists of the oscillating mass and the spring (or the potential field it creates). The total energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the potential energy stored in the spring.\n\n2.  **Write down the expressions for the energy components.**\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle of mass $m$ moving with speed $v$ is given by $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.

Understand the System and Principles**\nWe are dealing with a harmonic oscillator, but the speeds can be comparable to the speed of light, so we must use the principles of special relativity. The key principle is the conservation of total energy.\n\n**2. Define the Total Energy in a Relativistic System**\nThe total energy ($E_{total}$) of a particle in a potential field is the sum of its rest energy ($E_0$), its relativistic kinetic energy ($K$), and its potential energy ($U$).\n\n*   Rest Energy: $E_0 = mc^2$\n*   Relativistic Kinetic Energy: $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   Total Relativistic Energy of a free particle is $E = E_0 + K = mc^2 + (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \\gamma mc^2$.\n*   Potential Energy for a harmonic oscillator (from Hooke's Law, $F=-kx$): $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\nSo, the total conserved energy of the relativistic harmonic oscillator at any point in its motion is:\n$E_{total} = (\\text{Rest Energy} + \\text{Kinetic Energy}) + \\text{Potential Energy}$\n$E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n$E_{total} = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy**\nThe total energy $E_{total}$ must be the same at all points during the oscillation. We can find the value of this constant energy by looking at a specific point. The most convenient point is the maximum displacement (amplitude), where the velocity is zero.\n\n*   **At maximum displacement (x = A):**\n    The mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n    This means the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    The potential energy is maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    The total energy is:\n    $E_{total} = (1) \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\nNow we have the constant total energy of the system.\n\n**4. Analyze the point of Maximum Speed**\nThe speed is maximum when the mass passes through the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n\n*   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n    The speed is maximum, so we denote it as $v = v_{max}$.\n    The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n**5. Equate the Energies and Solve for v_max**\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at the maximum displacement is equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n\n$E_{total}(\\text{at } x=A) = E_{total}(\\text{at } x=0)$\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$.\nFirst, divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n$1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\nNext, invert both sides to isolate the square root term:\n$\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\nSquare both sides:\n$1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n$\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\nFinally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n$v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n**6.

Identify the Physical Principles\n\nThe problem involves a harmonic oscillator at relativistic speeds. The key principle to use is the **conservation of energy**. In relativistic mechanics, the total energy of a particle is not just its kinetic energy but includes its rest energy.\n\n### 2. Define the Total Relativistic Energy of the System\n\nFor a particle of rest mass $m$ moving with velocity $v$ in a potential $U(x)$, the total conserved energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy:\n$E_{total} = E_{relativistic} + U(x)$\n\nThe relativistic energy of the particle is given by $E_{relativistic} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\nThe potential energy for a harmonic oscillator (obeying Hooke's Law, $F=-kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\nSo, the conserved total energy for the relativistic harmonic oscillator is:\n$E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n### 3.

The potential energy is zero, and the mass reaches its maximum speed, $v = v_{max}$.\n    The Lorentz factor at this speed is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n### 4. Set up and Solve the Energy Conservation Equation\n\nSince energy is conserved, the total energy at Point 1 is equal to the total energy at Point 2:\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\nNow, substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} mc^2$\n\nOur goal is to solve this equation for $v_{max}$.\n\n1.  Divide the entire equation by $mc^2$ (assuming $m \\neq 0$ and $c \\neq 0$):\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n2.  To isolate $v_{max}$, we rearrange the equation to solve for the square root term. Take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n3.  Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n4.  Rearrange the equation to isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n5.  Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max}^2 = c^2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} \\right)$\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n### 5.

Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe problem involves a conservative force (the spring force), so the total energy of the system is conserved. The system consists of the mass and the potential energy stored in the spring.\n\nThe total energy of the system, $E_{sys}$, is the sum of the relativistic energy of the mass and the potential energy of the spring:\n$E_{sys} = E_{mass} + U(x)$\n\nThe relativistic energy of the mass is given by $E_{mass} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $m$ is the rest mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\nThe potential energy stored in the spring is given by Hooke's Law: $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\n**2.

Energy at Equilibrium Position (x = 0)**\n\nThe mass reaches its maximum speed, $v_{max}$, when it passes through the equilibrium position, $x = 0$.\n*   The displacement is $x = 0$.\n*   The potential energy stored in the spring is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n*   The velocity of the mass is $v = v_{max}$.\n*   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n*   The energy of the mass is at its maximum: $E_{mass, 0} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\nSo, the total energy of the system at this point is:\n$E_{sys} = E_{mass, 0} + U(0) = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n**4. Equating the Energies and Solving for v_max**\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at the maximum amplitude must equal the total energy at the equilibrium position:\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$.\nFirst, solve for $\\gamma_{max}$ by dividing the entire equation by $mc^2$:\n$\\frac{mc^2}{mc^2} + \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\gamma_{max}mc^2}{mc^2}$\n$1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max}$\n\nNow, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n$1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\nTo isolate $v_{max}$, we square both sides of the equation:\n$(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n\nNext, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$\\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for the term with $v_{max}$:\n$\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\nFinally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n$v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n**Non-relativistic Check:**\nIn the classical limit where the speed is much less than $c$, the term $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$ is very small.

The system is the mass under the influence of the spring force.\n2.  **Relativistic Energy:** In relativistic mechanics, the total energy of a particle is not just its kinetic energy. A consistent formulation for the conserved total energy of a particle in a potential field is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy.\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v$ is $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light. This energy includes both the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($K = (\\gamma-1)mc^2$).\n    *   The potential energy of a mass attached to a spring obeying Hooke's Law ($F = -kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where we set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n3.  **Total Conserved Energy:** The total conserved energy ($E_{total}$) of the system is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and its potential energy:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    This quantity remains constant throughout the oscillation.\n4.  **Analyze Two Key Points in the Oscillation:** We can find the value of this constant total energy by analyzing the system at a point where we know all the variables.

The total energy `E` of the oscillating mass is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy `U(x)`. The relativistic energy itself is composed of the rest energy (`mc^2`) and the relativistic kinetic energy (`(γ - 1)mc^2`).\nTherefore, the total energy can be expressed as:\n`E = γmc^2 + U(x)`\nwhere:\n*   `m` is the rest mass of the oscillator.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `v` is the instantaneous speed of the mass.\n*   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)` is the Lorentz factor.\n*   `U(x)` is the potential energy at position `x`.\n\nFor a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law (`F = -kx`), the potential energy stored in the spring is given by `U(x) = (1/2)kx^2`, assuming `U(0) = 0`.\n\nSo, the conservation of energy equation is:\n`E_total = γmc^2 + (1/2)kx^2 = constant`\n\n**2. Identify Key Points in the Oscillation**\n\nWe can analyze the energy of the system at two extreme points of the motion:\n\n*   **Point 1: Maximum Amplitude (x = A)**\n    *   At the maximum amplitude, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction.\n    *   The speed `v = 0`.\n    *   The Lorentz factor `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0^2/c^2) = 1`.\n    *   The potential energy is maximum: `U(A) = (1/2)kA^2`.\n    *   The total energy at this point is `E_total = (1)mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2 = mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2`.\n\n*   **Point 2: Equilibrium Position (x = 0)**\n    *   At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero (`U(0) = 0`).\n    *   The kinetic energy, and therefore the speed, is at its maximum. Let's call this maximum speed `v_max`.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is at its maximum: `γ_max = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2)`.\n    *   The total energy at this point is `E_total = γ_max * mc^2 + 0 = γ_max * mc^2`.\n\n**3. Equate the Energies and Solve for v_max**\n\nSince the total energy is conserved, the energy at Point 1 must equal the energy at Point 2:\n`mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2 = γ_max * mc^2`\n\nNow, we solve this equation for `v_max`. First, let's isolate `γ_max`:\n`γ_max = (mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2) / (mc^2)`\n`γ_max = 1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2)`\n\nNext, substitute the definition of `γ_max`:\n`1 / sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2)`\n\nNow, solve for `v_max`. Let's invert both sides:\n`sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))`\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate the square root:\n`1 - v_max^2/c^2 = 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))^2`\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for `v_max^2/c^2`:\n`v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))^2`\n\nFinally, multiply by `c^2` and take the square root to find `v_max`:\n`v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))^2)`\n\nThis expression matches option C.\n\n**4. Check for Classical Limit**\n\nAs a sanity check, let's see if this relativistic formula reduces to the classical formula when `c` is very large (`c -> ∞`). In this limit, the term `(kA^2) / (2mc^2)` becomes very small.\nLet `x = (kA^2) / (2mc^2)`.\n`v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - (1 + x)^-2`\nUsing the binomial approximation `(1+x)^n ≈ 1 + nx` for small `x`:\n`v_max^2/c^2 ≈ 1 - (1 - 2x) = 2x`\n`v_max^2/c^2 ≈ 2 * [(kA^2) / (2mc^2)]`\n`v_max^2/c^2 ≈ kA^2 / (mc^2)`\n`v_max^2 ≈ kA^2 / m`\n`v_max ≈ sqrt(kA^2 / m)`\nThis is the well-known classical result, which confirms that our relativistic derivation is correct.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nThis problem requires us to apply the principle of conservation of energy in the context of special relativity.

Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    $\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n\n3.  Take the reciprocal of both sides to isolate the term with $v_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n\n4.  Rearrange the equation to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n5.

Conclusion**\n\nThe derived expression matches option C. As a quick check, this formula is physically sound because the term $\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$ is always greater than 1 (for A > 0), which means the fraction is between 0 and 1, and the entire expression under the square root is between 0 and 1.

Principle of Conservation of Energy\n\nThe problem involves a conservative force (Hook's law), so the total energy of the system is conserved. In relativistic mechanics, the total energy ($E$) of a particle with mass $m$ and speed $v$ under a potential $U(x)$ is given by:\n$E = K + E_0 + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\nwhere:\n*   $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$ is the relativistic kinetic energy.\n*   $E_0 = mc^2$ is the rest energy.\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ is the potential energy of the spring.\n\nThe total energy $E$ remains constant throughout the oscillation.\n\n### 2. Identify Key Points in the Oscillation\n\nWe need to relate the state of the oscillator at its maximum displacement to its state at the equilibrium position.\n\n*   **At maximum displacement (amplitude):**\n    *   The position is $x = A$.\n    *   The mass is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n    *   Since $v=0$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0}} = 1$.\n    *   The potential energy is maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy at this point ($E_1$) is:\n        $E_1 = \\gamma mc^2 + U(A) = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n*   **At the equilibrium position:**\n    *   The position is $x = 0$.\n    *   The speed is maximum: $v = v_{max}$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    *   The total energy at this point ($E_2$) is:\n        $E_2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + U(0) = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n### 3. Apply Energy Conservation\n\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at both points must be equal:\n$E_1 = E_2$\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\nAn alternative way to think about this is using the work-energy theorem. The work done by the spring force when the mass moves from $x=A$ to $x=0$ is equal to the change in its kinetic energy.\nWork done by spring $W = \\int_A^0 F dx = \\int_A^0 (-kx) dx = [-\\frac{1}{2}kx^2]_A^0 = 0 - (-\\frac{1}{2}kA^2) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\nChange in kinetic energy $\\Delta K = K_{final} - K_{initial} = K(v_{max}) - K(0)$.\n$K(v_{max}) = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n$K(0) = (\\gamma(v=0)-1)mc^2 = (1-1)mc^2 = 0$.\nSo, $\\Delta K = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\nEquating work and change in kinetic energy:\n$\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\nThis equation can be rearranged to $\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$, which is the same as the energy conservation equation.\n\n### 4. Solve for $v_{max}$\n\nLet's proceed from the equation derived from energy conservation:\n$\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\nDivide the entire equation by $mc^2$:\n$\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\nNow, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\nTo solve for $v_{max}$, we need to isolate it. First, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\nSquare both sides:\n$1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\nRearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n$\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\nFinally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root:\n$v_{max}^2 = c^2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2} \\right)$\n$v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n### 5.

Define the System and Conservation of Energy\n\nWe consider a particle of rest mass $m$ subject to a harmonic potential. The total energy $E_{total}$ of a relativistic particle in a potential field $U(x)$ is the sum of its relativistic energy and potential energy. This total energy is conserved.\n\nThe relativistic energy of the particle is $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor, $v$ is the speed of the particle, and $c$ is the speed of light. Note that the relativistic energy includes the rest energy $mc^2$.\n\nThe force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy $U(x)$ is obtained by integrating the negative of the force with respect to position:\n$U(x) = -\\int_0^x F(x') dx' = -\\int_0^x (-kx') dx' = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\nThe total conserved energy of the system is:\n$E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n### 2. Identify Key States of Motion\n\nWe can find the maximum speed by applying the conservation of energy principle between two specific points in the oscillator's motion:\n\n*   **State 1: Maximum displacement (turning point)**\n    At the maximum amplitude, $x = A$, the particle is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n    At this point, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    The total energy is:\n    $E_{total, 1} = (1) \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n*   **State 2: Equilibrium position**\n    The speed is maximum ($v = v_{max}$) when the particle passes through the equilibrium position, $x=0$. At this point, the potential energy is zero, $U(0) = 0$.\n    The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The total energy is:\n    $E_{total, 2} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + U(0) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation of Energy and Solve for v_max\n\nSince energy is conserved, $E_{total, 1} = E_{total, 2}$.\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$:\n\n1.  Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n\n2.  To isolate the square root term, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$.\n\n3.  Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$.\n\n4.  Rearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$.\n\n5.  Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$.\n\n### 4.
