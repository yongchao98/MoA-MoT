Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer.**\nThe pH of the buffer is governed by the equilibrium involving H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, which corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4).\n*   Equilibrium reaction: H2PO4- (aq) ⇌ H+ (aq) + HPO4^2- (aq)\n*   The equilibrium constant is Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8.\n*   The expression for Ka2 is: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H+]. Since this is a buffer solution, we can approximate the equilibrium concentrations of the acid and base with their initial concentrations.\n*   [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n*   [H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n*   [H+] ≈ 8.110 x 10^-8 M\n\n**5.

We use the [H+] calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-], as the amount that dissociates is negligible due to the very small Ka3 value.\n*   [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n*   [PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.110 x 10^-8 M)\n*   [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.236 x 10^-7 M\n\nRounding this value to three significant figures gives 6.24 x 10^-7 M.\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThe problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution.\n\n**1.

Understand the System**\nThe solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O. In water, these salts dissociate completely:\n*   KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate)\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O → 2Na+ + HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate) + 2H2O\n\nThe key species are H2PO4- (a weak acid) and HPO4^2- (its conjugate base). Together, they form a buffer solution. The pH of this solution is primarily determined by the equilibrium involving this pair, which is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4):\n*   H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8\n\nThe concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is determined by the third dissociation step, which involves the HPO4^2- ion:\n*   HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12\n\n**2.

H2PO4- is a weak acid.\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissolves to produce Na+ ions and hydrogen phosphate ions (HPO4^2-). HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4-.\n    *   These two species, H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, create a buffer solution. The equilibrium governing this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n        H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8)\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of the buffer components:**\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 moles. This is the number of moles of H2PO4-.\n    *   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 moles. This is the number of moles of HPO4^2-.\n\n3.  **Calculate the concentrations of the buffer components:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.20000 L.\n    *   [H2PO4-] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.03674 M.\n    *   [HPO4^2-] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.02809 M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer:**\n    *   Using the equilibrium expression for Ka2:\n        Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    *   Rearrange to solve for [H+]:\n        [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n        [H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11x10^-8 M.\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) concentration:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n        HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12)\n    *   The equilibrium expression is:\n        Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    *   Rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-]. We use the [H+] calculated from the buffer equilibrium and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-] (since its dissociation is negligible):\n        [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n        [PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12) * (0.02809 M) / (8.11x10^-8 M) ≈ 6.24x10^-7 M.\n\nThis result matches the one calculated by the Python script.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nThe problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution.\n\n**1.

H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4-  (Ka1 = 7.5 x 10^-3)\n2.  H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8)\n3.  HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-  (Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12)\n\nOur solution contains significant amounts of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, so the pH will be determined primarily by the second equilibrium (Ka2).

There appears to have been an error in the initial reasoning. Let's re-evaluate the problem step-by-step to arrive at the correct solution confirmed by the code execution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components:** The solution contains:\n    *   KH₂PO₄, which dissociates into K⁺ and the dihydrogen phosphate ion, H₂PO₄⁻.

Understand the System**\n*   The solution contains KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O.\n*   In water, KH₂PO₄ dissolves to give K⁺ and the dihydrogen phosphate ion, H₂PO₄⁻.\n*   In water, Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissolves to give 2Na⁺ and the hydrogen phosphate ion, HPO₄²⁻.\n*   H₂PO₄⁻ is a weak acid, and HPO₄²⁻ is its conjugate base. Together, they form a buffer solution.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n*   Volume of solution (V) = 200.00 cm³ = 0.2000 L\n*   Mass of KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 g\n*   Molar mass of KH₂PO₄ (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n*   Mass of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = 1.00 g\n*   Molar mass of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n*   Phosphoric acid dissociation constants:\n    *   H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻ ; Ka₁ = 7.5x10⁻³\n    *   H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ ; Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n    *   HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ ; Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n\n**3. Goal**\n*   Calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻].\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation Plan**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the moles of the buffer components.**\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = Mass of KH₂PO₄ / Molar mass of KH₂PO₄\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = Mass of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O / Molar mass of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ / Volume (in L)\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles of HPO₄²⁻ / Volume (in L)\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺], in the buffer.**\n    *   The buffer system is governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n        H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   We can assume the initial concentrations are approximately equal to the equilibrium concentrations because it's a buffer. Rearrange the formula to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration, [PO₄³⁻].**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is formed in the third dissociation step:\n        HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearrange to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   Substitute the values calculated in the previous steps.\n\n*   **Step 5: Compare the result with the given options.**\n\nThe calculations were performed using the Python code in the previous turn.\n\n*   **Code Execution Recap:**\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.2000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.2000 L = 0.02809 M\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]) = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 / 0.02809) ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]) = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 / 8.11x10⁻⁸) ≈ 6.236x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe code output was `6.236e-07` M.\n\n*   **Comparing with the options:**\n    A) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n    B) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n    C) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n    D) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value, 6.236x10⁻⁷ M, is extremely close to option D, 6.24x10⁻⁷ M. The small difference is due to rounding in the option. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
