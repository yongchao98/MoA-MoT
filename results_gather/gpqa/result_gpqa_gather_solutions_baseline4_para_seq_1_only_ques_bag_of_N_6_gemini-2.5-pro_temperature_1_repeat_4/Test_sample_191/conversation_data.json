A positive point charge, $+q$, is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Principle of Electrostatic Induction:**\n    *   The positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. A total charge of $-q$ will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law: if you draw a Gaussian surface within the conducting material, the electric field must be zero, so the net charge enclosed must be zero. This means the charge $+q$ must be balanced by an induced charge of $-q$ on the cavity wall.\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall neutrality, since a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, a charge of $+q$ must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields created by all charges:\n    *   The original point charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle in electrostatics is that a closed conducting surface shields the region outside it from the electric fields of any charges located inside. Let's see why:\n    *   The electric field inside the bulk of the conductor is always zero in electrostatic equilibrium.\n    *   The total field at point P is $\\vec{E}_P = \\vec{E}_{\\text{internal}} + \\vec{E}_{\\text{outer}}$, where $\\vec{E}_{\\text{internal}}$ is the field from the charge $+q$ and the inner surface charge $-q$, and $\\vec{E}_{\\text{outer}}$ is the field from the outer surface charge $+q$.\n    *   It can be proven (using the uniqueness theorem of electrostatics) that the combined electric field produced by the charge inside the cavity ($+q$) and the induced charge on the inner surface ($-q$) is exactly zero everywhere outside the conductor.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined *solely* by the charge distribution on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Field from the Outer Surface Charge:**\n    *   We have a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   The outer surface is a sphere of radius $R$.\n    *   Since there are no other charges or electric fields outside the conductor, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface due to symmetry.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (or by applying Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field of a point charge of the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center O.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The various other parameters given in the problem, such as the cavity's radius ($r$), the position of the cavity's center ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle ($\\theta$), are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They serve as distractors. The conductor completely shields the external point P from the details of the charge arrangement inside the cavity. The only thing that matters externally is the total charge that gets pushed to the outer surface, which is $+q$, and the geometry of that outer surface.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ (Incorrect, uses distance from cavity center)\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ (Correct, uses distance from conductor center)\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complex distractor term)\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complex distractor term)\n\nThe final answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the conductor, it induces charges on the surfaces of the conductor due to electrostatic induction.\n    *   A charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). This happens because the free electrons in the conductor are attracted towards the positive charge `+q`.\n    *   Since the conductor was initially uncharged, its net charge must remain zero. To balance the induced negative charge `-q` on the inner surface, a positive charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the material of the conductor is zero. The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface arranges itself in such a way that it completely cancels the electric field produced by the charge `+q` for all points outside the cavity (i.e., inside the conductor material and outside the conductor). This phenomenon is known as electrostatic shielding.\n\n3.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** The electric field at the point P, which is outside the conductor, is the superposition of the fields from all charges present. These are:\n    *   The original charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface.\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n\n    Due to the shielding effect mentioned in step 2, the net electric field at point P from the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero. Therefore, the only charge that contributes to the electric field at point P is the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Field from the Outer Surface Charge:** The outer surface of the conductor is a sphere of radius `R`. The induced charge `+q` on this surface will distribute itself uniformly, regardless of the position of the cavity or the charge inside it. This is because the inner charges are shielded from the outer surface by the conducting material.\n\n5.  **Applying Gauss's Law:** For a spherically symmetric charge distribution (like the uniform `+q` on the outer surface), the electric field at an external point is the same as if the entire charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the outer spherical surface is the center of the conductor, O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center O.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Therefore, the electric field at point P is equivalent to the field of a point charge `+q` located at O. The magnitude of this field is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{(\\text{distance})^2}$\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n    Note that the information about the cavity's radius `r`, its distance `s` from the center, the distance `l` from the cavity's center to P, and the angle `\\theta` are all extraneous and not needed to find the field outside the conductor.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means its net charge is zero.\n\n2.  **Placing the charge:** A positive charge `+q` is placed inside the spherical cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction:** According to the principles of electrostatics, this charge `+q` will induce charges on the surfaces of the conductor.\n    *   **Inner Surface:** Consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity. In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside a conductor must be zero. Therefore, the net electric flux through this Gaussian surface is zero. By Gauss's Law ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_o}$), the total charge enclosed by this surface must be zero. Since the charge `+q` is inside the cavity, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity to make the net enclosed charge zero (`+q` + `-q` = 0).\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (zero net charge). Since a charge of `-q` has been induced on the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge conservation (net charge = 0 + (`-q`) + (`+q`) = 0).\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A crucial property of conductors is electrostatic shielding. The conductor material shields the region outside it from the electric fields created by charges inside the cavity. The combined electric field produced by the point charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner wall is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** As a result of the shielding effect, the electric field at any point P outside the conductor is solely due to the charge distribution on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** We have a total charge of `+q` on the outer surface. Since this surface is a sphere and there are no other external charges, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface of the conductor. The location of the cavity and the charge inside it do not affect this uniform distribution on the outer surface because of the shielding.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell at an external point is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude placed at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer surface = `+q`.\n    *   Center of the outer sphere = Center of the conductor (let's call it O).\n    *   Distance of the point P from the center O = `L`.\n\n8.  **Final Formula:** Using Coulomb's Law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe information about the cavity's radius `r`, its distance `s` from the center, the distance `l` from the cavity's center to P, and the angle `\\theta` are all extraneous details designed to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding. They are irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect.\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - Correct.\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem can be solved by applying the principles of electrostatics, specifically related to conductors and electrostatic shielding.\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the conductor, it induces charges on the surfaces of the conductor.\n    *   To ensure the electric field inside the conducting material is zero (a fundamental property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium), a total charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). This induced charge `-q` arranges itself on the inner surface to perfectly cancel the electric field produced by the `+q` charge for all points outside the cavity but within the conductor.\n    *   The spherical conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain its overall neutrality.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. This means that the charges inside the conductor (the original `+q` in the cavity and the induced `-q` on the cavity wall) do not produce any electric field outside the conductor. The electric field outside the conductor is determined solely by the charge distribution on its outer surface.\n\n3.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly. This is because the outer surface is a perfect sphere, and it is shielded from the non-symmetrical arrangement of the charge `+q` and the cavity inside. The charges on the outer surface will spread out as far as possible from each other, resulting in a uniform spherical distribution.\n\n4.  **Electric Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** A well-known result from Gauss's law is that the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell (or a solid sphere with a spherically symmetric charge distribution) is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at a point charge at its center.\n\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of this spherical surface is the center of the conductor, O.\n    *   The point P is located at a distance `L` from the center O.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field `E` at point P is equivalent to the field of a point charge `+q` located at O. The magnitude of this field is given by Coulomb's law:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe other parameters given in the problem, such as the cavity radius `r`, the distance of the cavity's center from the conductor's center `s`, the distance of P from the cavity's center `l`, and the angle `\\theta`, are all irrelevant for determining the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the shielding effect.

This means its net charge is zero. It has a cavity inside.\n\n2.  **Introduce the charge:** A positive point charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Induction of charges:** The presence of the charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute themselves.\n    *   **Inner Surface:** Negative charges (electrons) in the conductor are attracted towards the positive charge `+q`. They accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface within the material of the conductor that encloses the cavity, the electric field on this surface must be zero (as it's inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). For the field to be zero, the net charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity to cancel out the `+q` charge.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding positive charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain its overall neutrality. This `+q` charge will reside on the outer surface of the conductor, as charges in a conductor move to its surfaces.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it. The charge distribution on the inner surface (`-q`) arranges itself in such a way that its electric field, combined with the electric field of the point charge `+q`, results in a zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity. This ensures that the electric field inside the bulk material of the conductor is zero.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** Because the combined field of the charge `+q` in the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero outside the cavity, the electric field at the external point P is solely due to the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The outer surface of the conductor is a sphere of radius `R`. This outer surface is shielded from the non-uniform arrangement of charges inside the cavity. With no other external electric fields present, the charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly over the sphere.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field (Shell Theorem):** According to the shell theorem (which is a consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field at an external point due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the electric field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is the point from which the distance `L` is measured.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge `q` at the center of the conductor:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The details about the cavity's size (`r`), its position (`s`), the exact location of the charge `+q` within the cavity, the distance from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle `θ` are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the shielding effect.

The charges on the inner surface (`-q`) and the charge within the cavity (`+q`) arrange themselves in such a way that their combined electric field is zero everywhere outside the cavity. This means the charge distribution on the outer surface is completely unaffected by the position of the cavity or the charge inside it. Because the outer surface is a perfect sphere, the induced charge `+q` will distribute itself **uniformly** over the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:** The total electric field at point P is the superposition of the fields from all charges:\n    *   The original charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Applying the Shielding Concept:** As stated in step 3, the net electric field at point P due to the original charge `+q` and the induced inner surface charge `-q` is zero. Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined solely by the charge `+q` that is uniformly distributed on the outer spherical surface.\n\n6.  **Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** According to Gauss's Law (or the shell theorem), the electric field at an external point (a point outside the sphere) due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the outer spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is `L`.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Using the formula for the electric field of a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{\\text{(distance from center})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$: Incorrect.

This means the net charge on the conductor is zero. It has a cavity inside.\n\n2.  **Introduce the charge:** A positive charge, $+q$, is placed inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Induction on the inner surface:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges (free electrons) within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface entirely within the conducting material, the electric field must be zero everywhere on this surface. For the field to be zero, the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. This implies that the total charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity must be equal and opposite to the charge placed inside it. Therefore, a charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this $-q$ charge on the inner surface will be non-uniform, arranged in such a way as to cancel the electric field produced by the $+q$ charge for all points within the conductor.\n\n4.  **Induction on the outer surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral. Since a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, a net positive charge of $+q$ must be left behind on the conductor to maintain overall charge conservation (the initial net charge was zero). This excess positive charge, $+q$, will reside on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Distribution of charge on the outer surface:** A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conducting material is zero. This has a powerful consequence known as electrostatic shielding. The conductor material effectively shields the outer surface from the electric fields created by the charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$). As a result, the charge $+q$ on the outer surface is not influenced by the position of the cavity or the charge within it. It will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface to minimize repulsion, just as if it were the only charge present on an isolated spherical conductor.\n\n6.  **Calculating the electric field outside the conductor:** We need to find the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor. The total electric field at P is the vector sum of the fields produced by:\n    a. The charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n    b. The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface.\n    c. The induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface.\n\n7.  **Applying the shielding principle:** Due to electrostatic shielding, the net electric field produced by the charge inside the cavity ($+q$) and the charge on the inner surface ($-q$) is zero for all points outside the cavity. So, for point P, we only need to consider the electric field generated by the charge on the outer surface.\n\n8.  **Field from the outer surface charge:** We have a charge of $+q$ distributed uniformly over a spherical surface of radius $R$. According to the Shell Theorem (a consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n\n9.  **Final Calculation:** The problem states that point P is at a distance $L$ from the center of the spherical conductor. Therefore, the electric field at P is equivalent to the field from a point charge $+q$ located at the conductor's center. The magnitude of this field is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{\\text{(distance from center)}^2}$\n\n    Substituting our values:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n10. **Conclusion:** The specific details about the cavity's location ($s$), its radius ($r$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle ($\\theta$) are all extraneous information designed to distract from the core principle of electrostatic shielding. The field outside the conductor only depends on the total charge on its outer surface and the distance from its center.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for the electric field at point P is $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the effect of the charge inside the cavity:**\n    The positive charge `+q` is placed inside a cavity within a spherical conductor. This charge will polarize the conductor, inducing charges on its surfaces.\n    *   **Inner Surface (Cavity Wall):** According to Gauss's Law, if we consider a Gaussian surface entirely within the conducting material that encloses the cavity, the electric field inside the conductor must be zero. For the net electric flux through this surface to be zero, the total charge enclosed must be zero. Since there is a charge `+q` inside the cavity, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This induced charge `-q` will distribute itself on the inner surface in such a way that it, together with the original charge `+q`, creates zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity, specifically within the conducting material.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface from the conductor's free electrons, a net charge of `+q` must be left behind on the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality. This excess charge `+q` will reside on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply the principle of Electrostatic Shielding:**\n    A key property of a closed conductor is that it acts as an electrostatic shield. The charges on the outer surface are shielded from the electric fields of the charges inside the cavity. This means the distribution of the charge `+q` on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the charge `+q` inside the cavity, nor by the position or shape of the cavity itself.\n\n3.  **Determine the charge distribution on the outer surface:**\n    The charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself to be in electrostatic equilibrium. Since the outer surface is a sphere and it is isolated (no other external charges are mentioned), the charge `+q` will spread out uniformly over the entire outer surface.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Electric Field outside the conductor:**\n    The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges. However, due to the shielding effect, the net electric field produced by the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero everywhere outside the cavity. Therefore, the electric field at point P is solely due to the uniform distribution of charge `+q` on the outer spherical surface.\n\n5.  **Use the Shell Theorem:**\n    The Shell Theorem (a direct result of Gauss's Law) states that the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as that of a point charge with the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the outer sphere is the center of the conductor, let's call it O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center O.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Applying the formula for the electric field of a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{\\text{(distance)}^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The information about the cavity's radius `r`, its distance `s` from the center, the distance `l` from the cavity's center to P, and the angle `\\theta` are all distractors.

Inside this conductor, there is an off-center spherical cavity. A point charge of +q is placed somewhere within this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply the properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium:** A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the material of the conductor must be zero.\n\n3.  **Consider the effect of the charge +q in the cavity (Gauss's Law):** Let's imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity. Since the electric field everywhere on this Gaussian surface is zero, the total electric flux through it is zero. According to Gauss's Law ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$), the total charge enclosed by this surface must be zero. The enclosed charge consists of the point charge +q inside the cavity and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity ($q_{inner}$).\n    Therefore, $q + q_{inner} = 0$, which implies $q_{inner} = -q$. A total charge of -q gets induced on the inner wall of the cavity.\n\n4.  **Consider the charge on the outer surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). After the charge induction, a charge of -q has appeared on its inner surface. To maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor itself, a charge of +q must appear on its outer surface. So, we have:\n    *   Charge inside the cavity: +q\n    *   Charge on the inner surface of the conductor: -q\n    *   Charge on the outer surface of the conductor: +q\n    The net charge of the conductor remains zero (-q + q = 0), and the total charge of the whole system is +q.\n\n5.  **Principle of Electrostatic Shielding:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the vector sum of the fields produced by all three charge distributions: the +q in the cavity, the -q on the inner surface, and the +q on the outer surface.\n    A crucial consequence of the E=0 property inside a conductor is electrostatic shielding. The charges within the cavity (+q) and on the cavity wall (-q) arrange themselves in such a way that their combined electric field is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity. This ensures the field within the conductor remains zero. Therefore, for any point P outside the conductor, the contribution to the electric field from the charge +q in the cavity and the induced charge -q on the inner surface is zero.\n\n6.  **Calculate the field from the outer surface charge:** This means the electric field at point P is solely due to the charge +q residing on the outer surface of the spherical conductor. Since there are no external electric fields and the outer surface is a perfect sphere, this charge +q will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface to minimize electrostatic potential energy.\n\n7.  **Apply the Shell Theorem:** According to the shell theorem (which is a direct result of Gauss's Law), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge on the shell were concentrated into a single point charge at its center.\n    *   The total charge on the outer shell is +q.\n    *   The center of the shell is the center of the spherical conductor.\n    *   The distance of point P from the center of the conductor is L.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** The magnitude of the electric field at point P is therefore given by the formula for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The radius of the cavity (r), the displacement of its center (s), the distance of P from the cavity's center (l), and the angle ($\\theta$) are all extraneous pieces of information designed to test the understanding of the core concept of electrostatic shielding.

This induced charge will distribute itself on the inner surface in a way that its field, combined with the field of the point charge $+q$, results in a zero field everywhere outside the cavity (specifically, within the conductor).\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral).\n    *   We have just established that a charge of $-q$ has been drawn to the inner surface.\n    *   To maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else.

Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external charges mentioned in the problem, this charge $+q$ will spread out uniformly over the entire outer surface. The complex arrangement inside the cavity (the position of the charge $+q$, the shape and position of the cavity) does not affect the charge distribution on the outer surface.

This induced charge will distribute itself non-uniformly on the inner surface to cancel the field of the `+q` charge within the conductor.\n\n4.  **Consider the charge on the outer surface:**\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged (net charge = 0).\n    *   We've just established that a charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface from the free electrons within the conductor.\n    *   To maintain overall charge neutrality for the conductor, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   So, we now have a charge of `+q` on the outer surface of the spherical conductor (the sphere of radius `R`).\n\n5.  **Determine the distribution of the outer charge:**\n    *   The problem is to find the electric field *outside* the conductor. The electric field outside is caused only by the charges on the outer surface.\n    *   The conducting material acts as an electrostatic shield.

Since the electric field `E` is zero everywhere on this surface, the net electric flux through it is zero. According to Gauss's Law ($\\Phi_E = Q_{enclosed} / \\epsilon_o$), the total charge enclosed by this surface must be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge `+q` and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity, `q_inner`. Therefore, `+q + q_inner = 0`, which implies `q_inner = -q`. A charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n2.  **Charge conservation and the outer surface:**\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged. We now have a charge of `-q` on its inner surface.\n    *   To conserve the total charge of the conductor (which must remain zero), a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor. So, `q_outer = +q`.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:**\n    *   The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. This means that the electric field in the region outside the conductor is determined solely by the charge distribution on the outer surface and any charges external to the conductor. In this problem, there are no other external charges.\n    *   The arrangement of charges inside the cavity (the point charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall) does not produce any electric field outside the conductor.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is produced entirely by the `+q` charge that resides on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Charge distribution on the outer surface:**\n    *   The charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself in a way that makes the conductor an equipotential surface.\n    *   Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external charges to influence it, the charge `+q` will spread out uniformly over the surface. The non-symmetrical position of the cavity inside has no effect on the outer charge distribution due to the shielding effect of the conducting material.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   We need to find the electric field at point P, which is at a distance `L` from the center of the conductor (O).\n    *   According to the shell theorem (a consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case, we have a total charge of `+q` distributed uniformly on the outer spherical surface of radius `R`. The center of this sphere is O.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field `E` at point P (at distance `L > R` from O) is the same as that of a point charge `+q` placed at O.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Using Coulomb's Law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at distance `L` from a charge `q` is:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion on extraneous information:**\n    *   The problem provides several other parameters: the radius of the cavity `r`, the distance of the cavity's center from the conductor's center `s`, the distance of point P from the cavity's center `l`, and the angle `\\theta`.\n    *   Based on the principle of electrostatic shielding, all of this information about the internal geometry is irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor.

To cancel the electric field within the bulk of the conductor (a defining property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium), a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law applied to a surface within the conducting material enclosing the cavity.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface, to maintain overall charge neutrality for the conductor, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Distribution of the induced charges:**\n    *   The charge `+q` is placed at an arbitrary point *inside* the cavity, not necessarily at its center. This means the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface will **not** be distributed uniformly. It will be denser on the parts of the wall closer to `+q`.\n    *   However, the charge `+q` on the **outer surface** is a different story. The conductor's bulk acts as an electrostatic shield. The charges on the outer surface are shielded from the specific arrangement of charges inside the cavity. Because the outer surface is a perfect sphere, the charge `+q` will distribute itself **uniformly** over this outer surface to minimize repulsion, regardless of the cavity's position or the charge's position within it.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P (Outside):** The total electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges:\n    *   The original charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface.\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n\n6.  **The Shielding Effect:** A fundamental theorem of electrostatics states that for any point outside a closed conducting shell, the electric field due to the charges *inside* the shell and the charges induced on the *inner surface* of the shell is exactly zero. In our case, the field at P due to the `+q` in the cavity and the `-q` on the cavity wall cancels out completely.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Therefore, the electric field at the external point P is due **only** to the charge `+q` distributed on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   We have a total charge of `+q` distributed uniformly on a spherical surface of radius `R`.\n    *   According to another key result from Gauss's law (often called the Shell Theorem), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The distance of point P from the center O is `L`.\n\n    Thus, the magnitude of the electric field at P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The information regarding the cavity's radius (`r`), the position of its center (`s`), the distance from the cavity's center to P (`l`), and the angle `theta` are all extraneous details designed to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding.

This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law: if we draw a Gaussian surface inside the conductive material enclosing the cavity, the electric field inside the conductor must be zero. For this to be true, the net charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must be zero. Since there is a charge of `+q` inside, the induced charge on the inner wall must be `-q`.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (uncharged). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it provides electrostatic shielding. The charges on the outer surface are shielded from the electric fields created by the charges inside the cavity (the original charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the inner wall). Conversely, the region inside the cavity is shielded from any external electric fields.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** We have a total charge of `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor. Since this outer surface is a sphere and it is shielded from the non-symmetrical arrangement inside the cavity, and there are no other external charges mentioned, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface.

This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have an electrically neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor. Inside this conductor, there is a spherical cavity. A positive point charge, +q, is placed somewhere inside this cavity.\n\n2.  **Principle of Electrostatic Induction:** The presence of the positive charge +q inside the cavity will affect the free electrons within the conductor.\n    *   The positive charge +q will attract the free electrons in the conductor. These electrons will move and accumulate on the surface of the cavity. This creates an induced negative charge on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity).\n    *   To determine the total amount of this induced negative charge, we can apply Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity.\n    *   A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conducting material must be zero ($\\vec{E}_{conductor} = 0$).\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through our Gaussian surface is $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$. Since $\\vec{E} = 0$ everywhere on this surface, the total flux is zero. This implies that the total charge enclosed by the surface, $Q_{enclosed}$, must also be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge +q and the induced charge on the inner surface, $q_{inner}$. So, $Q_{enclosed} = +q + q_{inner} = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the induced charge on the inner surface of the cavity is $q_{inner} = -q$.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially uncharged (net charge = 0). After the charge induction, a charge of -q has accumulated on the inner surface. Since charge must be conserved, a corresponding positive charge must appear elsewhere in the conductor.\n    *   Charge in a conductor resides on its surfaces. Thus, a charge of +q must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n    *   Total charge of the conductor = $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = -q + (+q) = 0$. This is consistent with the initial condition.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):** The conductor material effectively shields the outer surface from the electric field produced by the charges inside the cavity (+q and the induced -q). The arrangement of the charge +q and the induced charge -q on the inner wall is such that their combined electric field is zero everywhere outside the cavity, including within the conductor and outside the conductor.\n    *   This means the distribution of the +q charge on the *outer surface* is not affected by the position of the cavity (s), the size of the cavity (r), or the exact location of the charge +q within the cavity.\n    *   Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external electric fields, the +q charge will distribute itself *uniformly* over the outer surface.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields from all charges:\n    *   Field from the point charge +q inside the cavity.\n    *   Field from the induced charge -q on the inner surface.\n    *   Field from the induced charge +q on the outer surface.\n\n    As established by the principle of shielding, the net electric field at P from the first two sources (the +q charge in the cavity and the -q charge on the cavity wall) is zero.\n\n    Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined solely by the +q charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Shell Theorem:** For a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge on the shell were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case, we have a total charge of +q distributed uniformly on the outer surface (a sphere of radius R).\n    *   The point P is located at a distance L from the center of this sphere.\n    *   Using Coulomb's law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at P is:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{(\\text{Total charge on outer surface})}{(\\text{distance from center})^2}$\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The parameters describing the cavity's geometry and location (r, s), the distance from the cavity's center (l), and the angle ($\\theta$) are irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to electrostatic shielding.

Let's break down the physics step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Initial State:** We have an electrically neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor. This means the net charge of the conductor is zero.\n\n2.  **Placing a Charge Inside the Cavity:** A point charge of `+q` is placed inside the cavity. This charge will create an electric field.\n\n3.  **Induced Charges:** Conductors contain mobile charges (electrons) that are free to move. In the presence of the electric field from the `+q` charge, these mobile charges will redistribute themselves.\n    *   **Inner Surface:** Negative charges within the conductor will be attracted to the positive charge `+q`. They will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. To completely shield the interior of the conductor from the field of `+q`, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law applied to a surface just inside the conductor material, where the electric field must be zero. The total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero, so `q_{enclosed} = q_{point\\_charge} + q_{inner\\_surface} = +q + q_{inner\\_surface} = 0`, which implies `q_{inner\\_surface} = -q`.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a net positive charge of `+q` must be left behind elsewhere on the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality. These positive charges will repel each other and move as far apart as possible, which means they will distribute themselves on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges located inside it. The arrangement of the `-q` charge on the inner cavity surface precisely cancels the field from the `+q` charge for all points outside the cavity. Consequently, the charge distribution on the outer surface is not affected by the positions of the charges inside the cavity (`+q` and the induced `-q`).\n\n5.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Since the `+q` charge on the outer surface is shielded from the asymmetrically located cavity and internal charge, and because the conductor itself is spherical, this `+q` charge will distribute itself **uniformly** over the outer spherical surface of radius `R`.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:** We need to find the electric field `E` at a point P, which is outside the conductor. The total electric field at P is the superposition of the fields from all charges: the `+q` inside the cavity, the `-q` on the inner surface, and the `+q` on the outer surface.\n    However, we can use a powerful simplification from Gauss's Law known as the **Shell Theorem**. For any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is the same as if all the charge on the shell were concentrated into a single point charge at its center.\n    *   The charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   It is distributed uniformly on a sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   The center of this sphere is the center of the conductor, O.\n    *   The field at point P, at a distance `L` from the center O, is therefore equivalent to the field of a point charge `+q` located at O.\n    *   Also, due to shielding, the net electric field at P from the combination of the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall is zero.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Using Coulomb's Law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n    The effective charge is `+q` located at the center O. The distance from O to P is `L`.\n    Therefore,\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe information about the cavity's radius `r`, its offset from the center `s`, the distance `l`, and the angle `θ` is extraneous and not needed to find the electric field outside the conductor. This is a classic example of electrostatic shielding.\n\nComparing our result with the given options, we find that it matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThis is a classic problem in electrostatics involving conductors and cavities. Let's break down the physics step-by-step.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor. This means its net electric charge is zero. It has a cavity inside, which is also initially empty and uncharged.\n\n2.  **Introducing the charge:** A positive charge `+q` is placed somewhere inside the spherical cavity. This is the crucial action that sets up the electric fields.\n\n3.  **Induction of charges:**\n    *   **On the inner surface (cavity wall):** The positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, the electric field inside the material of the conductor must be zero. If we draw a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity, the total charge inside this Gaussian surface must be zero for the field to be zero. Since there is a `+q` charge placed in the cavity, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This induced charge `-q` will distribute itself non-uniformly on the cavity wall to ensure the electric field from itself and the charge `+q` cancel out completely within the conductor.\n\n    *   **On the outer surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged (neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has moved from the bulk of the conductor to the inner surface, a net positive charge of `+q` must be left behind. As there can be no static charge within the bulk of a conductor, this excess charge `+q` must reside on the outermost surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Distribution of the outer charge:** The crucial concept here is **electrostatic shielding**. The conducting material shields the outside region from the electric field produced by the charges inside the cavity (the original `+q` and the induced `-q`). Consequently, the distribution of the charge `+q` on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the cavity or the position of the charge `+q` within it. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external fields, the charge `+q` will distribute itself **uniformly** over the surface of the large sphere of radius `R`.\n\n5.  **Calculating the electric field outside:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields from all charges present:\n    *   The original charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface.\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n\n    However, due to the shielding effect, the net electric field produced by the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero everywhere outside the cavity. A more precise statement is that the field at point P is the field produced by the charge distribution on the outer surface only.\n\n    So, we only need to calculate the electric field produced by the charge `+q` distributed uniformly on the outer spherical surface of radius `R`.\n\n6.  **Applying Shell Theorem (or Gauss's Law):** For a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge of the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer shell = `+q`.\n    *   Center of the outer sphere = Center of the conductor, O.\n    *   Point of measurement = P.\n    *   Distance from the center O to the point P = `L`.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by the formula for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{(\\text{distance})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Evaluating the given information:** The problem provides several other parameters: the radius of the cavity `r`, the distance of the cavity's center from the conductor's center `s`, the distance of P from the cavity's center `l`, and an angle `\\theta`. As established by the reasoning above, due to electrostatic shielding, none of these details about the cavity's location or the charge's position within it affect the electric field outside the conductor. This information is extraneous and intended to be a distraction. The only quantities that matter are the charge `q` and the distance `L` from the center of the *conductor*.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Comparing our result with the given options:\n    A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n    B) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n    C) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n    D) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity. A charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity. We need to find the electric field `E` at a point `P` located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Principle of Charge Induction:**\n    *   The positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges in the conductor. A total charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law: if you draw a Gaussian surface entirely within the conducting material enclosing the cavity, the electric field on this surface must be zero (as it's inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). For the field to be zero, the net charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, the induced charge on the inner wall must be `-q` to cancel the `+q` inside.\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged (neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, to maintain overall charge neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key concept here is electrostatic shielding. A conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of charges placed inside it. The details of the charge configuration inside the cavity (the exact position of `+q`, the shape and position of the cavity) do not affect the electric field *outside* the conductor.\n    *   The total electric field at any point is the superposition of the fields from all charges: the original charge `+q`, the induced inner surface charge `-q`, and the induced outer surface charge `+q`.\n    *   Let's consider the combined effect of the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface. This pair of charges creates an electric field that is non-zero inside the cavity, but is *exactly zero* everywhere outside the cavity (i.e., within the conductor material and outside the conductor).\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is determined *solely* by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   We've established that a total charge of `+q` resides on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external electric fields, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the surface. The internal asymmetric configuration is completely shielded from the outer surface by the conducting material. The charges on the outer surface will arrange themselves to make the potential constant, which for an isolated sphere results in a uniform distribution.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   The problem now simplifies to finding the electric field at point P due to a uniformly charged spherical shell of radius `R` with a total charge `+q`.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (or Gauss's Law), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the electric field produced by a single point charge of the same total magnitude, located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case:\n        *   The total charge on the outer shell is `+q`.\n        *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n        *   The distance of the point P from the center O is `L`.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge `+q` at O:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Given Information:**\n    *   The problem provides several other parameters: the radius of the cavity `r`, the distance of the cavity's center from the conductor's center `s`, the distance of P from the cavity's center `l`, and an angle `\\theta`.\n    *   Based on the principle of electrostatic shielding, all of this information (`r`, `s`, `l`, `\\theta`) is irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. It serves as a distractor. This information would be necessary only if we were asked to calculate the field *inside* the cavity.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The correct expression for the electric field at point P is the one that depends only on the total charge `q` and the distance `L` from the center of the conductor.\n\n    Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ (Incorrect, uses distance from cavity center)\n    B) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ (Correct, uses distance from conductor center)\n    C) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, uses irrelevant parameters)\n    D) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, uses irrelevant parameters)\n\nThe final answer is determined by the fundamental properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We begin with a spherical conductor that is electrically neutral (has no net charge). It has a cavity inside.\n\n2.  **Introduce the charge:** A positive charge, `+q`, is placed inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** The presence of the positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. To understand the total amount of induced charge, we can use Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity. The electric field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero. According to Gauss's Law, the net electric flux through this surface is zero, which implies that the total electric charge enclosed by the surface must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge `+q` placed inside and the charge induced on the inner cavity wall ($q_{inner}$).\n    $q_{enclosed} = +q + q_{inner} = 0$\n    Therefore, the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity is $q_{inner} = -q$. The distribution of this `-q` charge will be non-uniform, arranged to precisely cancel the field from `+q` within the conductor material.\n\n4.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor ($q_{outer}$).\n    Total charge on conductor = $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = -q + q_{outer} = 0$ (since the conductor itself was uncharged)\n    This gives $q_{outer} = +q$.\n\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of a closed conducting shell is that it provides electrostatic shielding. This means:\n    *   The charges inside the cavity (the original `+q` and the induced `-q` on the inner wall) produce zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity.\n    *   The charge on the outer surface (`+q`) distributes itself completely independently of the arrangement of charges inside the cavity.\n\n6.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The `+q` charge on the outer surface will spread out to minimize repulsion. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere, the charge will distribute itself uniformly over this surface.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The point P is outside the conductor. The total electric field at P is the sum of the fields from all charges:\n    *   The field from the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner wall. As stated by the principle of electrostatic shielding, the net field from these two at any point outside the cavity is zero.\n    *   The field from the induced charge `+q` which is distributed uniformly on the outer spherical surface of radius R.\n\n    Therefore, the electric field at point P is solely due to the uniform spherical shell of charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n\n8.  **Applying the Shell Theorem:** The shell theorem (a result derived from Gauss's Law) states that the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer shell = `+q`.\n    *   Center of the shell = Center of the conductor, O.\n    *   Distance of point P from the center O = `L`.\n\n    Thus, the magnitude of the electric field at P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q_{outer}}{L^2} = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n9.  **Conclusion on other variables:** The information about the cavity's position (`s`), the distance of P from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle `\\theta` are all distractors. Due to electrostatic shielding, the details of the cavity's geometry and the charge's position within it do not influence the electric field outside the conductor. The external field only depends on the total charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the outer sphere.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ (Incorrect, uses distance from cavity center)\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complex distance)\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ (Correct)\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complex distance)\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor with an off-center spherical cavity. A point charge `+q` is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction:** The presence of the charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile electrons in the conductor to redistribute themselves. This is known as electrostatic induction.\n    *   **Inner Surface:** To shield the conducting material from the electric field of the charge `+q`, a charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, if we imagine a Gaussian surface just inside the bulk of the conductor enclosing the cavity, the electric field must be zero. This implies the net charge enclosed by this surface must be zero. Since there is `+q` inside the cavity, a total charge of `-q` must accumulate on the inner wall of the cavity.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (uncharged). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain its overall neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it. The electric field at any point outside the cavity, produced by the sum of the charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall, is zero.\n    Therefore, the electric field at point P outside the main conductor is caused *only* by the charge present on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The charge on the outer surface is `+q`. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external charges in the vicinity, this induced charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface to be in electrostatic equilibrium. The non-uniform arrangement inside the conductor (the off-center cavity and charge) has no effect on the distribution of charge on the outer surface because of the shielding effect of the conducting material.\n\n5.  **Electric Field outside a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** A fundamental result from Gauss's Law (also known as the Shell Theorem) is that for any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the outer spherical surface is the center of the conductor, O.\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is `L`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Electric Field:** Using the principle from step 5, the electric field `E` at point P is the same as the field produced by a point charge `+q` located at the center O of the conductor.

This means its net charge is zero.\n    *   A positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law and the properties of conductors, the electric field inside the bulk of the conductor must be zero. To achieve this, a total charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity (the wall of the cavity).

After inducing `-q` on the inner surface, to maintain overall charge neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n2.  **Determine the distribution of the outer charge:**\n    *   We need to find the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor.

The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   Let's consider the combined effect of the charges inside the conductor (the `+q` in the cavity and the `-q` on the inner wall). A fundamental property of electrostatic shielding is that a conducting shell isolates the region outside the shell from the electrostatic influence of charges placed inside it. The charge distribution on the inner surface (`-q`) arranges itself in such a way that its field perfectly cancels the field of the internal charge `+q` for all points outside the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P due to the combination of the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the charge `-q` on the inner wall is zero.\n    *   This leaves only the field produced by the `+q` charge on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Calculate the field from the outer charge:**\n    *   The charge `+q` on the outer surface is on an isolated spherical conductor. In the absence of any other external electric fields, this charge will distribute itself uniformly over the surface to be in electrostatic equilibrium (this is the lowest energy configuration).\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem, the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The outer surface is a sphere of radius `R` centered at O.

This means the net charge of the conductor is zero. Inside this conductor, there is a cavity.\n\n2.  **Placing the charge:** A positive charge, $+q$, is placed somewhere inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges (electrons) in the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity, the electric field inside the conductor must be zero. For the electric field to be zero, the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. This means the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity must be exactly equal and opposite to the charge placed inside. Therefore, a charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner wall of the cavity.\n\n4.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else on the conductor. These positive charges (which are essentially the atoms left behind by the migrated electrons) will repel each other and move as far apart as possible. They will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor. Thus, a charge of $+q$ is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of charges inside it. The conducting material between the cavity and the outer surface prevents the electric field from the charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$) from reaching the outside. The net electric field at any point outside the conductor is produced *only* by the charges on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The charge $+q$ on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the charge inside the cavity due to the shielding effect. This $+q$ charge will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface to minimize electrostatic potential energy.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:** According to the shell theorem (a consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the outer spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center O.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Therefore, the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at point P is the same as the field from a point charge $+q$ located at O.

A point charge `+q` is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field `E` at a point `P` located outside the entire conductor.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Induction:** The presence of the positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile electrons within the conductor to redistribute themselves. This is known as electrostatic induction.\n    *   **Inner Surface (Cavity Wall):** Electrons from the conductor will be attracted towards the `+q` charge. They will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. To completely cancel the electric field from `+q` within the bulk of the conductor (a key property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside them is zero), a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a net charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall charge conservation.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A crucial concept here is electrostatic shielding. The conductor acts as a shield. The charges inside the cavity (the original `+q` and the induced `-q` on the inner surface) are arranged in such a way that their net electric field is zero everywhere outside the cavity. Conversely, the charges on the outer surface (`+q`) produce zero electric field inside the conductor.\n    *   This means that the electric field at point `P` (outside the conductor) is produced *only* by the charge `+q` located on the outer surface of the conductor. The configuration inside the cavity (the exact position of the charge `+q`, the position and size of the cavity) has no effect on the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The `+q` charge on the outer surface will distribute itself to be in equilibrium. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external charges nearby, this `+q` charge will spread out uniformly over the entire outer surface.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** According to a well-known result from Gauss's Law (also known as Shell Theorem), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field produced by a point charge of the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is the reference point.\n    *   The point `P` is at a distance `L` from the center of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Final Formula:** Therefore, we can treat the entire conductor as if it were a point charge `+q` located at its center.

The only relevant quantities for the external field are the total charge induced on the outer surface (`+q`) and the distance from the center of the conductor to the point `P` (`L`).\n\nComparing this result with the given options, we find that option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have an uncharged (neutral) spherical conductor with an off-center spherical cavity.

According to Gauss's Law, if we imagine a Gaussian surface completely within the conducting material, the electric field there must be zero (since it's a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). This implies that the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge +q and the induced charge on the cavity wall ($Q_{inner}$). Therefore, $+q + Q_{inner} = 0$, which means $Q_{inner} = -q$. A total charge of -q gets induced on the inner surface.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor as a whole was initially uncharged. Since a charge of -q has been drawn to the inner surface, a charge of +q must appear on the outer surface to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor. So, the total charge on the outer surface is $Q_{outer} = +q$.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):** A crucial property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields the outside region from the electric field of any charges inside it. The combined electric field produced by the point charge +q inside the cavity and the induced charge -q on the inner surface is zero everywhere outside the cavity. Consequently, the distribution of the charge +q on the *outer surface* is not influenced by the position or configuration of charges inside the cavity.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The +q charge on the outer surface will distribute itself in a way that makes the surface an equipotential. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external electric fields, the only way for it to be an equipotential is for the charge +q to be distributed uniformly over its surface.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** A fundamental result from Gauss's law is that the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field of a single point charge with the same total charge, located at the center of the sphere.\n\n6.  **Putting it all Together:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is +q.\n    *   This charge is distributed uniformly.\n    *   The center of the outer spherical surface is the center of the conductor, O.\n    *   The point P where we want to find the field is at a distance L from the center O.\n\n7.  **Calculation:** The electric field at point P is therefore equivalent to the field produced by a point charge +q located at the center O.

This means the net charge on the conductor is zero. It has a cavity inside.\n2.  **Placing a charge inside the cavity:** A positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity.\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** According to Gauss's Law, the electric field inside the material of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero. If we imagine a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity, the total electric flux through this surface must be zero. This implies that the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, the charge `+q` inside the cavity must induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity. So, a charge of `-q` is induced on the wall of the cavity.\n4.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (uncharged). Since a charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface from the conductor's free electrons, a net charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain overall charge conservation. This `+q` charge will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is electrostatic shielding. The conductor material shields the region outside from the electrostatic influence of the charges inside the cavity. The electric field inside the conductor is zero, effectively isolating the outer surface from the specific arrangement of the charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` within the cavity.\n6.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor will distribute itself in a way that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. For a spherical conductor, the most stable configuration (lowest energy) is a uniform distribution of charge over its surface, regardless of any internal cavities or charges.\n7.  **Calculating the External Electric Field:** Now, we need to find the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor. The electric field at P is the superposition of the fields created by all charges. However, due to shielding, the field at P is solely determined by the charge distribution on the *outer surface* of the conductor. We have established that there is a total charge of `+q` distributed uniformly on the outer spherical surface of radius `R`.\n8.  **Shell Theorem:** According to the Shell Theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the electric field of a single point charge with the same total charge, located at the center of the sphere.\n9.  **Final Calculation:** In our case, the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is the same as that of a point charge `+q` located at the conductor's center.\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n10. **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   The parameters `r` (cavity radius), `s` (cavity position), `l` (distance from cavity center to P), and `θ` describe the internal geometry. Due to electrostatic shielding, these details do not affect the electric field outside the conductor.\n    *   Option A, C, and D depend on these internal parameters (`l`, `s`, `θ`), which is incorrect.\n    *   Option B correctly identifies that the field depends only on the total induced charge on the outer surface (`+q`) and the distance from the center of the conductor (`L`).\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\n*   **Initial State:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. Since it is uncharged, its net charge is zero.\n\n*   **Placing a Charge Inside:** A positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity.\n\n*   **Charge Induction (Inner Surface):** According to Gauss's Law and the properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the material of the conductor must be zero. To achieve this, the charge `+q` inside the cavity will induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity. Let's consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity.\n    *   $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$\n    *   Since $\\vec{E} = 0$ everywhere inside the conductor, the flux integral is zero.\n    *   $0 = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$\n    *   This means the total charge enclosed by our Gaussian surface must be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge placed in the cavity (`+q`) and the charge induced on the inner surface (`q_inner`).\n    *   $q_{enclosed} = +q + q_{inner} = 0$\n    *   Therefore, $q_{inner} = -q$. A charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n*   **Charge Induction (Outer Surface) & Charge Conservation:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (zero net charge). We have just \"created\" a charge of `-q` on its inner surface by moving electrons. To maintain overall charge neutrality, an equal amount of positive charge must appear somewhere else. Since charges can only reside on the surfaces of a conductor in equilibrium, a charge of `+q` must be induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n    *   $Q_{total} = q_{inner} + q_{outer} = 0$ (since it was initially uncharged)\n    *   $-q + q_{outer} = 0$\n    *   Therefore, $q_{outer} = +q$.\n\n*   **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage):** A key concept here is electrostatic shielding. The conductor material effectively shields the outer surface from the electrostatic influence of the charges inside the cavity. The combination of the original charge `+q` and the induced inner surface charge `-q` creates zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity. This means the distribution of charge on the outer surface is independent of the position of the charge `+q` within the cavity.\n\n*   **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** We have a total charge of `+q` on the outer surface, which is a sphere of radius `R`. Since there are no other external charges to influence it, and it is shielded from the internal charges, this `+q` charge will distribute itself uniformly over the outer spherical surface.\n\n*   **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** We need to find the electric field at point P, a distance `L` from the center of the conductor. The electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge on the shell were concentrated into a single point charge at its center.\n    *   The charge on the outer shell is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the shell is the center of the spherical conductor, O.\n    *   The distance from the center O to point P is `L`.\n    *   Using Coulomb's Law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at P is:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The information about the cavity's radius (`r`), its off-center position (`s`), the distance `l`, and the angle `theta` is extraneous. The principle of electrostatic shielding simplifies the problem, making the external field dependent only on the net charge that appears on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nThus, the correct expression for the magnitude of the electric field is $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have an electrically neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor. Inside this conductor, there is a spherical cavity that is not at the center of the conductor. A positive point charge, $+q$, is placed somewhere inside this cavity.\n\n2.  **Apply the principles of electrostatics for conductors:**\n    *   **Electric Field inside a Conductor:** In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the material of the conductor must be zero.\n    *   **Gauss's Law:** This law relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the net charge enclosed within that surface.\n\n3.  **Determine the induced charges:**\n    *   Consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity. Since the electric field is zero everywhere on this Gaussian surface, the total electric flux through it is zero.\n    *   According to Gauss's law, this means the total charge enclosed by the surface must be zero.\n    *   The charge enclosed consists of the point charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity, let's call it $q_{inner}$.\n    *   Therefore, $+q + q_{inner} = 0$, which implies that the induced charge on the inner surface of the cavity is $q_{inner} = -q$.\n\n4.  **Consider the overall charge of the conductor:**\n    *   The problem states that the spherical conductor was initially uncharged. The total charge of the conductor is the sum of the charge on its inner surface and the charge on its outer surface ($q_{outer}$).\n    *   To maintain its overall neutrality, the total charge on the conductor must remain zero.\n    *   So, $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = 0$.\n    *   Substituting $q_{inner} = -q$, we get $-q + q_{outer} = 0$, which means the charge induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor is $q_{outer} = +q$.\n\n5.  **Determine the electric field outside the conductor:**\n    *   The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges in the system: the original charge $+q$ in the cavity, the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface, and the induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface.\n    *   **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is that they provide electrostatic shielding. The conducting material shields the region outside the conductor from the electric fields of any charges located inside a cavity within it. In other words, the electric field produced by the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface sum to zero for all points outside the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is due *only* to the charge $+q$ residing on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Determine the distribution of charge on the outer surface:**\n    *   The outer surface of the conductor is a sphere of radius $R$. The charge $+q$ on this surface will distribute itself to be in equilibrium.\n    *   Since the conductor is isolated (no other external charges are mentioned) and its outer surface is perfectly spherical, the charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface to minimize electrostatic potential energy. The non-uniformity of the cavity inside does not affect the outer distribution due to the shielding effect of the conductor.\n\n7.  **Calculate the electric field at point P:**\n    *   The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell at a point outside the shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the shell.\n    *   In our case, the outer surface has a total charge of $+q$, is spherical, and is centered at the center of the conductor. The point P is at a distance $L$ from this center.\n    *   Thus, the electric field at P is the same as that of a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.\n    *   Using Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field is:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Evaluate the given information:**\n    *   The problem provides extra information: the radius of the cavity ($r$), the distance of the cavity's center from the conductor's center ($s$), the distance of point P from the cavity's center ($l$), and an angle ($\\theta$).\n    *   Based on the principle of electrostatic shielding, all this information about the internal geometry is irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. This information is included as a distractor to test the understanding of the fundamental concepts.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe electric field at the external point P depends only on the total charge induced on the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance of P from the center of the spherical conductor ($L$).

This means the net charge on the conductor is zero.\n2.  **Introduce the charge:** A positive charge, $+q$, is placed inside the cavity.\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Cavity Wall:** The presence of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor towards it. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface entirely within the conducting material that encloses the cavity, the electric field inside the conductor must be zero. For the net flux through this surface to be zero, the total charge enclosed must be zero. Therefore, a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this $-q$ charge will be non-uniform, arranging itself to perfectly cancel the field of the $+q$ charge for all points outside the cavity.\n4.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially neutral (zero total charge). Since a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, a charge of $+q$ must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain its overall charge neutrality. This $+q$ charge will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is that they provide electrostatic shielding. The charges inside the cavity ($+q$) and on the cavity wall ($-q$) arrange themselves in such a way that their net electric field is zero everywhere outside the cavity. This means an observer outside the conductor cannot tell where the charge $+q$ is located inside the cavity. The only field they experience comes from the charges on the outer surface.\n6.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The charge $+q$ on the outer surface will distribute itself to be in equilibrium. Since the outer surface is a sphere and there are no other external electric fields, the charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** For a spherically symmetric charge distribution (like the uniform $+q$ on the outer surface of the sphere), the electric field at any external point is the same as if the entire charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere (a result from Gauss's Law, often called the Shell Theorem).\n8.  **Final Calculation:** The point P is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the spherical conductor. The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$. Therefore, the electric field at point P is equivalent to the field from a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.

Due to electrostatic induction, this charge will attract negative charges and repel positive charges within the mobile charge sea of the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge induction on the surfaces:**\n    *   **Inner Surface (Cavity Wall):** To cancel the electric field produced by the point charge `+q` inside the bulk of the conductor (a necessary condition for electrostatic equilibrium), a total charge of `-q` gets induced on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this `-q` charge on the inner wall will not be uniform; it will be denser on the parts of the wall closer to the `+q` charge.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface to maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):**\n    A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields the exterior region from the electrostatic effects of any charges placed inside it. The electric field inside the material of the conductor must be zero. This implies that the combined electric field from the point charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface must be zero everywhere outside the cavity, including within the conductor material and in the region outside the conductor.\n    Therefore, the electric field at point P outside the conductor is solely due to the charge `+q` residing on the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Distribution of charge on the outer surface:**\n    The `+q` charge on the outer surface will distribute itself to make the surface an equipotential. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external electric fields, the charge `+q` will spread out uniformly over the outer surface. The non-uniform arrangement of the charge `+q` and the cavity inside does not affect the charge distribution on the outer surface due to the shielding effect of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    The electric field at an external point P due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the electric field produced by a point charge equal to the total charge on the shell, located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is `L`.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The distances `r` (cavity radius), `s` (cavity offset), `l` (distance from P to cavity center), and the angle `θ` are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor.

A point charge `+q` is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field `E` at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Principle of Electrostatic Induction:**\n    *   The positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. A total charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law: if you imagine a Gaussian surface just inside the bulk of the conductor enclosing the cavity, the electric field must be zero everywhere on this surface (since it's inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). For the field to be zero, the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, the induced charge on the inner wall of the cavity must be `-q` to cancel the `+q` charge.\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain overall charge neutrality, since a `-q` charge has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of a closed conductor is that it acts as an electrostatic shield. The charges inside the cavity (`+q`) and the induced charges on the inner wall (`-q`) arrange themselves in such a way that their net electric field is zero everywhere outside the cavity, including within the bulk of the conductor and at all points outside the conductor.\n    *   This means that the electric field at point P is determined *only* by the charge distribution on the *outer surface* of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   The charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   Because of the shielding effect of the conductor, the distribution of this `+q` charge on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the charge inside the cavity.\n    *   Since the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere and there are no other external electric fields, the `+q` charge will distribute itself uniformly over this spherical surface.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell, at any point outside the shell, is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In this problem, we have a charge of `+q` uniformly distributed on the outer sphere, which is centered at the center of the conductor.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the conductor.\n    *   Therefore, we can use the formula for the electric field of a point charge to find the field at P:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{(\\text{Total charge on outer surface})}{(\\text{distance from center})^2}$\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The information about the cavity's radius (`r`), its position (`s`), the distance `l` from the cavity's center, and the angle `θ` are all distractors. They are irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the principle of electrostatic shielding. The correct expression for the electric field at point P is based solely on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThis is a classic problem in electrostatics that demonstrates the principle of electrostatic shielding. Let's break down the physics step-by-step.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Initial State:** We start with an uncharged, electrically neutral spherical conductor. This means the total charge of the conductor is zero.\n2.  **Placing a Charge Inside the Cavity:** A positive point charge `+q` is placed somewhere inside the cavity.\n3.  **Induction on the Inner Surface:** According to Gauss's Law, the electric field inside the material of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero. If we consider a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity, the total electric flux through this surface must be zero. This implies that the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must also be zero. Since there is a charge `+q` inside the cavity, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). This induced charge `-q` distributes itself on the inner surface in a way that cancels the electric field from `+q` for all points within the conductor material.\n4.  **Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially neutral. We have just established that a charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface from the free electrons within the conductor. To maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor, a net positive charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere. Since these are conductors, charges are free to move. This excess positive charge will repel itself and move as far apart as possible, which means it will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n5.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The outer surface is a sphere of radius `R`. In the absence of any other external electric fields, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface. This is because a uniform distribution on a sphere is the configuration of minimum electrostatic potential energy.\n6.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields the outside region from the electric fields of any charges inside it. The combined electric field at any point outside the conductor, due to the charge `+q` in the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface, is exactly zero.\n7.  **Calculating the Field Outside:** Therefore, the electric field at point P (which is outside the conductor) is produced *solely* by the charge `+q` that is distributed on the outer surface of the conductor.\n8.  **Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** The electric field at an external point due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is given by the same formula as the electric field from a point charge equal to the total charge on the shell, located at the center of the sphere (this is known as the Shell Theorem).\n9.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the outer spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The distance of the point P from the center O is `L`.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is equivalent to the field of a point charge `+q` at O.\n    *   Using Coulomb's law:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{|charge|}{(distance)^2} = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe parameters `r` (radius of the cavity), `s` (distance between centers), `l` (distance from cavity center to P), and `θ` (angle) are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are provided to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding. The external field only depends on the total charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct expression for the electric field at point P is:\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the setup:** We have an initially uncharged (electrically neutral) spherical conductor of radius $R$. Inside this conductor, there is a spherical cavity of radius $r$. The cavity is off-center, with its center O' being at a distance $s$ from the center O of the main conductor. A point charge of $+q$ is placed somewhere inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field magnitude $E$ at a point P located outside the conductor, at a distance $L$ from the center O.\n\n2.  **Apply Principles of Electrostatics for Conductors:**\n    *   **Charge Induction:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will cause the mobile charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute. Negative charges will be attracted towards the $+q$ charge and accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   **Gauss's Law:** Consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the bulk of the conducting material and encloses the cavity. A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside its material is zero ($\\vec{E}_{conductor} = 0$). Therefore, the electric flux through our chosen Gaussian surface is zero. According to Gauss's Law ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = Q_{enclosed}/\\epsilon_o$), the total net charge enclosed by this surface must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the charge induced on the inner wall of the cavity, let's call it $q_{inner}$. So, $+q + q_{inner} = 0$, which means $q_{inner} = -q$. A total charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Conservation:** The conductor was initially uncharged (neutral). Since a charge of $-q$ has accumulated on the inner surface, to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else. In a conductor, excess charge resides on its surfaces. Since the $-q$ is on the inner surface, the $+q$ charge must reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):** This is the crucial concept for this problem. A conducting shell isolates the region outside the shell from the charges inside it. The charge distribution on the outer surface of the conductor, and consequently the electric field it produces outside, is independent of the arrangement of charges inside the cavity. The only thing that matters for the outside world is the total charge that gets pushed to the outer surface.\n\n5.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** We have a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface, which is a sphere of radius $R$. Since this conductor is isolated and the outer surface is perfectly spherical, there is no preferred direction. The charges will spread out to minimize repulsion and make the surface an equipotential. Due to symmetry, the only possible stable distribution is a uniform one. So, the charge $+q$ is distributed uniformly over the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:** The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell, at any point outside the shell, is identical to the electric field produced by a single point charge of the same total magnitude, located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer shell is $+q$.\n    *   The center of this spherical shell is O.\n    *   The point of interest, P, is at a distance $L$ from the center O.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q_{outer}}{L^2}$\n    Since $q_{outer} = +q$, we have:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$: This would be the field if the conductor were absent and the charge was at the cavity's center. It ignores the shielding effect.\n    *   B) and C) involve $l$, $s$, and $\\theta$. These parameters describe the position of the cavity and the relation between P and the cavity. As explained by the shielding principle, these details are irrelevant for the field outside the conductor.\n    *   D) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$: This matches our derivation perfectly.\n\nThe problem provides extra information ($l$, $s$, $r$, $\\theta$) to test the understanding of the fundamental principle of electrostatic shielding. The external field of a neutral conductor with an internal charge depends only on the total internal charge and the shape and center of the outer surface.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\n*   **Initial State:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor. This means the net charge on the conductor is zero.\n*   **Placing a Charge:** A positive charge `+q` is placed inside a cavity within the conductor.\n*   **Charge Induction:** Due to electrostatic induction, this `+q` charge will attract negative charges and repel positive charges within the conductor.\n    *   A charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is required by Gauss's Law: if you draw a Gaussian surface entirely within the conducting material (where the electric field must be zero), the net charge enclosed by that surface must be zero. Thus, the charge `+q` inside the cavity must be canceled by an induced charge of `-q` on the cavity wall.\n    *   Since the conductor as a whole was initially neutral, and a charge of `-q` has accumulated on the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere to maintain overall neutrality. This `+q` charge is repelled to the farthest possible location, which is the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n*   **Electrostatic Shielding:** A crucial property of a closed conducting shell is that it acts as an electrostatic shield. The charges inside the conductor (the original `+q` and the induced `-q` on the inner wall) create an electric field. However, the conductor itself rearranges its charges in such a way that the net electric field due to *all* charges (the ones inside the cavity and the ones on the conductor's surfaces) is zero *everywhere inside the conducting material*. A consequence of this shielding is that the distribution of charge on the outer surface is completely independent of the arrangement of charges inside.\n*   **Field Outside the Conductor:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is produced only by the charges on the outer surface of the conductor. The field contribution from the `+q` charge in the cavity and the `-q` charge on the inner surface perfectly cancels out for all points outside the conductor.\n*   **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** We have a charge `+q` induced on the outer surface, which is a sphere of radius R. Since there are no other external charges in the vicinity, this `+q` charge will distribute itself uniformly over the outer spherical surface.\n*   **Calculating the Field at Point P:** For any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is the same as if all the charge on the shell were concentrated into a single point charge at its center.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is at a distance `L` from the point P.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Charge on outer surface}}{(\\text{distance from center})^2}$\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The radius of the cavity (`r`), the location of its center (`s`), the distance of P from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle `\\theta` are all extraneous pieces of information.

A positive charge $+q$ is then placed inside a spherical cavity within the conductor. The conductor itself is isolated.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Induction:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will cause the free charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute themselves.\n    *   To cancel the electric field produced by $+q$ inside the conducting material (a key property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium), a total charge of $-q$ will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   The conductor was initially electrically neutral (charge = 0). Since a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, a charge of $+q$ must be left on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality for the conductor itself.\n\n3.  **Charge Distribution:**\n    *   **Inner Surface:** The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the cavity will not be uniformly distributed. It will be denser on the parts of the wall closer to the location of the charge $+q$.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The charge $+q$ on the outer surface is shielded from the electric field of the charges inside the cavity (+q and the induced -q). This is a fundamental property of conductors known as electrostatic shielding. Because the outer surface is a perfect sphere and it is shielded from the asymmetric configuration inside, the charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The electric field at any external point P is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges in the system:\n    *   The original charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Applying the Shielding Principle:** The combination of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface produces zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity. This is because the conductor rearranges the charge on the inner wall to perfectly cancel the field from the internal charge $+q$ within the bulk of the conductor and thus everywhere outside of it.\n\n6.  **Contribution from the Outer Surface:** Therefore, the only charge distribution that contributes to the electric field at the external point P is the uniform charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n7.  **Applying the Shell Theorem (or Gauss's Law):** According to the shell theorem, for any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer surface = $+q$.\n    *   Center of the outer sphere = Center of the conductor (let's call it O).\n    *   Distance from the center O to the point P = $L$.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** The magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total charge on outer surface}}{(\\text{distance from center})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**Conclusion:** The various other distances and angles provided in the problem (like $r, s, l, \\theta$) are irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the principle of electrostatic shielding. The external field only depends on the total charge that moves to the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state and the change:** We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means its net charge is zero. A positive charge $+q$ is then introduced into the cavity within the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction:** According to the principles of electrostatics, the presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. By applying Gauss's Law to a surface enclosed entirely within the conducting material and surrounding the cavity, the electric field must be zero everywhere on this Gaussian surface. This implies that the net charge enclosed by the surface must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge $+q$ and the total charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity ($q_{inner}$).\n    \n    $q + q_{inner} = 0$\n    $q_{inner} = -q$\n    \n    So, a total charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially uncharged (net charge = 0). The induction of charge $-q$ on the inner surface means that a corresponding positive charge must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain its overall neutrality. This positive charge will move to the outer surface of the conductor. Let the charge on the outer surface be $q_{outer}$.\n    \n    $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = 0$ (since the conductor itself has no net charge)\n    $(-q) + q_{outer} = 0$\n    $q_{outer} = +q$\n    \n    So, a total charge of $+q$ is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding and Charge Distribution:** A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside its bulk material is zero. The charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$ on the inner wall) create a complex electric field. The charges on the outer surface ($+q$) must arrange themselves to completely cancel this field within the conductor's material. Because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere, the only way to ensure the field inside the conductor remains zero and the surface remains an equipotential is for the charge $+q$ to distribute itself *uniformly* over the outer spherical surface. This phenomenon is known as electrostatic shielding; the conductor shields the exterior region from the electrostatic influence of the charges inside the cavity. The non-uniformities of the charge distribution inside are canceled out by the induced charges on the inner cavity wall.\n\n5.  **Calculating the External Electric Field:** Now we need to find the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor. The total electric field at P is the superposition of the fields from all charges: the charge $+q$ in the cavity, the charge $-q$ on the inner surface, and the charge $+q$ on the outer surface. However, due to the shielding effect, the net electric field produced by the charge inside the cavity ($+q$) and the charge on the inner surface ($-q$) is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity. A more direct way to see this is that the field outside is produced solely by the charges on the outer surface.\n\n    We have a uniform distribution of charge $+q$ on the surface of a sphere of radius $R$. According to a result from Gauss's Law (also known as Newton's Shell Theorem for electricity), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a point charge at the center of the sphere.\n\n    *   The charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The distance of point P from the center O is $L$.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q_{outer}}{L^2} = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Options:** The variables related to the cavity's geometry and position ($r$, $s$) and the relative position of point P to the cavity ($l$, $\\theta$) are irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor. They are distractors intended to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding.\n\n    Let's compare our result with the given options:\n    A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - This matches our derived result.\n    B) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.

A total charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this charge might be non-uniform, as it depends on the exact position of the $+q$ charge inside the cavity.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:**\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged. The induction of a charge $-q$ on the inner surface must be balanced by an equal and opposite charge appearing elsewhere on the conductor to maintain its overall initial charge (which was zero before the +q charge was introduced).\n    *   This means a charge of $+q$ must be induced on the conductor.

According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through this surface must be zero, which implies the net charge enclosed by it must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge `+q` and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity, let's call it $q_{inner}$. Therefore, $+q + q_{inner} = 0$, which means $q_{inner} = -q$. A total charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this charge `-q` will not be uniform; it will be denser on the part of the cavity wall closer to the charge `+q`.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has been induced on the inner surface, a corresponding charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor. This charge `+q` will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Distribution of the Outer Charge (Electrostatic Shielding):**\n    *   The conducting material acts as an electrostatic shield. This means that the charges on the outer surface are shielded from the electric fields of the charges inside the cavity (`+q` and the induced `-q`).\n    *   Because the outer surface is a sphere and there are no other external charges in the vicinity, the charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself **uniformly** over the surface. The specific location of the cavity and the charge `q` inside it does not affect the distribution of charge on the *outer* surface.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   The total electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the vector sum of the fields produced by:\n        1.  The charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n        2.  The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface.\n        3.  The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n    *   A fundamental result of electrostatics is that for any point outside a closed conducting shell, the electric field produced by the charges inside the shell and the induced charges on the inner surface of the shell is exactly zero.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined **solely** by the charge `+q` which is distributed uniformly on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (or Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field of a point charge of the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case, the total charge on the outer shell is `+q`. The center of this spherical shell is the center of the conductor, O. The point P is at a distance `L` from this center O.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    The magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{|Total \\, Charge|}{(distance)^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The problem provides extra information such as the cavity's radius `r`, its distance `s` from the center, the distance `l` from the cavity's center to P, and the angle `θ`.

This means it has a large number of free-moving electrons, but the total positive charge from the atomic nuclei is balanced by the total negative charge of the electrons.\n\n2.  **Placing a charge inside the cavity:** A positive charge, `+q`, is introduced into the cavity. This charge will exert an attractive force on the free electrons within the conductor.\n\n3.  **Induction on the inner surface:** In response to the `+q` charge, free electrons from the conductor will be drawn towards the cavity and will accumulate on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). This creates a net negative charge on the inner surface. According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface entirely within the material of the conductor that encloses the cavity, the electric field on this surface must be zero (as it's inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). For the field to be zero, the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, the total charge induced on the inner surface must be exactly `-q` to cancel out the `+q` charge placed inside. The distribution of this `-q` charge on the inner surface will not be uniform; it will be arranged to precisely cancel the electric field produced by `+q` in the region of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Induction on the outer surface:** The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of `-q` (from the free electrons) has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding deficit of electrons is created elsewhere in the conductor. This results in a net positive charge appearing on the conductor. Since these positive charges are free to move on the conductor's surface and they repel each other, they will move as far apart as possible, which means they will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor. The total charge on this outer surface must be `+q` to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor (`-q` on the inner surface + `+q` on the outer surface = 0 net induced charge).\n\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage):** A key principle of electrostatics is that a closed conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of charges inside it. In our case, the conductor acts as a shield. The electric field at any point outside the conductor is produced *only* by the charges on the outer surface. The fields from the original charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface perfectly cancel each other out for all points outside the cavity.\n\n6.  **Distribution of charge on the outer surface:** The charge `+q` is on the outer surface of the spherical conductor. Because this surface is a sphere and is shielded from the non-symmetrical arrangement of charges within the cavity, and there are no other external electric fields, the `+q` charge will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n\n7.  **Calculating the external electric field:** The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell at a point outside the shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude placed at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer surface = `+q`.\n    *   The center of the outer sphere is the center of the conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is `L`.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by the formula for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The other parameters given in the problem, such as the radius of the cavity `r`, the distance of the cavity's center from the conductor's center `s`, the distance `l`, and the angle `\\theta`, are irrelevant for determining the electric field *outside* the conductor.

Let's break down the situation step-by-step to find the electric field at point P.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have a spherical conductor that is initially uncharged. It has a spherical cavity within it. A positive point charge, `+q`, is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field `E` at a point `P` located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction:** The presence of the positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile electrons within the conductor to redistribute.\n    *   To shield the interior of the conductor from the electric field of `+q`, negative charges will be attracted to the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). By applying Gauss's Law to a surface just inside the conducting material enclosing the cavity, the electric field must be zero. This implies that the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, a total charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   The conductor was initially electrically neutral (uncharged). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding positive charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor. This charge `+q` will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electric Field at an External Point P:** The total electric field at point P is the vector sum of the fields produced by three sets of charges:\n    *   The original charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface (cavity wall).\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A crucial principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the fields of any charges located inside it. The combined electric field produced by the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity. This is because the `-q` charge arranges itself precisely to cancel the field of `+q` for all points within the conductor and beyond.\n\n5.  **Field from the Outer Surface:** Because of this shielding effect, the electric field at point P (outside the conductor) is produced *only* by the charge distributed on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** We have determined that the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. Since this outer surface is a sphere and is not under the influence of any other *external* charges (and is shielded from the internal ones), the charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface to be in electrostatic equilibrium. The specific location of the charge `+q` inside the cavity does not affect the distribution of charge on the outer surface.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell at any point outside the shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge equal to the total charge on the shell, located at the center of the shell.\n    *   The total charge on the outer shell is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is at O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center O.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   The information given about the cavity's radius `r`, its center's offset `s`, the distance `l` from the cavity's center to P, and the angle `θ` is all extraneous detail designed to distract from the core physics principles. The shielding property of the conductor makes these details irrelevant for finding the field *outside* the conductor.\n    *   Comparing our derived result with the given options:\n        *   A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\n        *   B) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\n        *   C) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - Correct. This matches our derivation.\n        *   D) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect. This would be the field if the source were at the center of the cavity, which is not the case due to the conductor.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe electric field outside the conductor is solely determined by the uniformly distributed charge `+q` on its outer surface. This setup is equivalent to a point charge `+q` located at the center of the spherical conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to the point P is `L`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have an electrically neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor of radius $R$. Inside this conductor, there is a small spherical cavity. A point charge of $+q$ is placed somewhere within this cavity. We need to find the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** The positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. To determine the total amount of this induced charge, we can apply Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity.\n    *   A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field ($\\vec{E}$) inside the conductor's material is zero.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the net charge enclosed ($Q_{enc}$) divided by the permittivity of free space ($\\epsilon_o$).  $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_o}$.\n    *   Since $\\vec{E} = 0$ everywhere on our Gaussian surface within the conductor, the flux is zero. This implies that the net charge enclosed by the surface must also be zero ($Q_{enc} = 0$).\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge $+q$ and the total charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity, let's call it $q_{inner}$.\n    *   So, $Q_{enc} = q + q_{inner} = 0$.\n    *   This leads to $q_{inner} = -q$. A total charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This charge will not be distributed uniformly, as its distribution depends on the exact position of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged, meaning its net charge was zero. Since it is an isolated conductor, its total net charge must remain zero.\n    *   The total charge of the conductor is the sum of the charge on its inner surface and the charge on its outer surface ($q_{outer}$).\n    *   Total charge = $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = 0$.\n    *   Substituting the value of $q_{inner}$, we get $-q + q_{outer} = 0$.\n    *   This implies $q_{outer} = +q$. A total charge of $+q$ is induced on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields the region outside the shell from the electrostatic effects of charges located inside the shell.\n    *   The electric field at point P outside the conductor is the vector sum of the fields created by all charges: the point charge $+q$, the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface, and the induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface.\n    *   Due to the shielding effect of the conductor, the combined electric field produced by the point charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is solely due to the charge $+q$ residing on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n5.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The outer surface of the conductor is a sphere of radius $R$. The charge $+q$ on this surface will distribute itself to make the surface an equipotential. In the absence of any other external electric fields, the only way to achieve this for a spherical surface is for the charge to distribute itself uniformly. The complex arrangement of charges inside the cavity does not affect the distribution on the outer surface because of the shielding.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** Now the problem is reduced to finding the electric field at point P due to a uniformly distributed charge of $+q$ on a spherical shell of radius $R$.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (a result that can also be derived from Gauss's Law), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if the entire charge of the shell were concentrated as a point charge at its center.\n    *   The total charge on the outer shell is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the shell is the center of the spherical conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to the point P is given as $L$.\n    *   Using Coulomb's Law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at P is:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The radius of the cavity ($r$), the distance of its center from the conductor's center ($s$), the distance of P from the cavity's center ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are distractor variables.

We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the entire conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will cause the mobile electrons within the conductor to redistribute.\n    *   Electrons will be attracted towards the $+q$ charge, accumulating on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). To find the total charge induced on this inner surface, we can apply Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity.\n    *   In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the bulk of a conductor must be zero. Therefore, the electric flux through our chosen Gaussian surface is zero.\n    *   Gauss's Law ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$) tells us that the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must also be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge $(+q)$ and the induced charge on the inner cavity wall $(q_{inner})$.\n    *   So, $q + q_{inner} = 0$, which means $q_{inner} = -q$. A charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of $-q$ has accumulated on the inner surface, to maintain overall neutrality of the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else on the conductor. As charges can only reside on surfaces in electrostatics, this $+q$ charge will spread out on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):** A crucial principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of charges located inside it. The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is determined *only* by the charge distribution on the outer surface of the conductor. The configuration inside the cavity (the exact position of the charge $+q$, the off-center location of the cavity, and the resulting non-uniform distribution of the $-q$ charge on the cavity wall) has no effect on the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n5.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** We have a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor. Since this outer surface is a perfect sphere (radius R) and there are no other external charges in the problem, this $+q$ charge will distribute itself **uniformly** over the outer surface due to symmetry.\n\n6.  **Calculating the External Electric Field:** According to the shell theorem (which is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law for spherical symmetry), the electric field at an external point due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a single point charge of the same total magnitude, located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the outer spherical surface is the center of the conductor, let's call it O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from this center O.\n\n7.  **Final Formula:** Using Coulomb's Law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{(\\text{distance from center})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   The other pieces of information given in the problem (the cavity radius $r$, the distance $s$ between the centers, the distance $l$ of P from the cavity's center, and the angle $\\theta$) are irrelevant for finding the field *outside* the conductor.

It has a cavity inside.\n\n2.  **Placing the charge:** A positive point charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Induction on the inner surface:** The presence of the positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges from the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, to make the electric field inside the conducting material zero, the total charge induced on the inner surface must be equal and opposite to the charge enclosed.\n    *   Let's consider a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity.\n    *   The electric field $\\vec{E}$ must be zero everywhere on this Gaussian surface because it is inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium.\n    *   Gauss's Law states: $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$.\n    *   Since $\\vec{E} = 0$, the integral is zero, which implies that the total charge enclosed, $Q_{enclosed}$, must be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge `+q` and the charge induced on the inner cavity surface, $q_{inner}$.\n    *   $Q_{enclosed} = +q + q_{inner} = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the charge induced on the inner surface is $q_{inner} = -q$.\n\n4.  **Induction on the outer surface:** The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding positive charge must appear elsewhere to maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor. This excess positive charge will move to the outermost surface of the conductor to maximize its separation.\n    *   Total charge of the conductor = $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = 0$ (since it was initially uncharged).\n    *   $-q + q_{outer} = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the charge induced on the outer surface is $q_{outer} = +q$.\n\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of a closed conducting shell (like our spherical conductor) is that it shields its exterior from the electric field of any charges placed inside it. The electric field at any point outside the conductor is determined *only* by the charge distribution on the *outer surface* of the conductor. The original charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface combine to produce zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity, which includes point P.\n\n6.  **Charge distribution on the outer surface:** We have a total charge of `+q` on the outer surface of the spherical conductor. Since there are no other external charges or fields, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface. This happens because the shielding effect prevents the internal charges from influencing the outer charge distribution.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** Now, the problem is simplified to finding the electric field from a uniformly charged spherical shell with total charge `+q` and radius `R`. According to the Shell Theorem (a direct result of Gauss's Law), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at a point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer shell = `+q`.\n    *   Center of the shell = O.\n    *   Point of interest = P.\n    *   Distance from the center O to the point P = `L`.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** The magnitude of the electric field at P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{(\\text{Distance from center})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nNotice that the details about the cavity's location (`s`), its radius (`r`), the distance from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle (`\\theta`) are all irrelevant to the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the principle of electrostatic shielding.

Inside this conductor, there is a spherical cavity that is not at the center of the conductor. A positive point charge, `+q`, is placed at some location within this cavity.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface (Cavity Wall):** The positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract the free electrons within the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the surface of the cavity. To completely cancel the electric field from the charge `+q` inside the bulk of the conductor (a key property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium), the total charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity must be `-q`. This can be proven by applying Gauss's Law to a surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity. Since the electric field `E` is zero everywhere on this Gaussian surface, the total charge enclosed must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge (`+q`) and the charge on the cavity wall (`q_inner`). Therefore, `+q + q_inner = 0`, which implies `q_inner = -q`.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` (electrons) has moved to the inner surface, a net positive charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality. As the electric field inside a conductor must be zero, these excess positive charges will repel each other and move to the outermost surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Distribution of the Outer Charge:** The charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly. This is a crucial point. The conductor has a property called electrostatic shielding. The arrangement of the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall ensures that their combined electric field is zero everywhere outside the cavity. Therefore, the charges on the outer surface are only influenced by the spherical shape of the outer conductor itself. For a spherical conductor, the charge distributes uniformly over its surface to reach electrostatic equilibrium.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges:\n    *   The field from the point charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The field from the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall.\n    *   The field from the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Applying the Shielding Principle:** As established in step 4, the combined electric field from the charge `+q` within the cavity and the charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero for all points outside the cavity. This includes the point P.\n\n7.  **Simplifying the Problem:** Therefore, the electric field at point P is solely determined by the charge `+q` that is uniformly distributed on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n8.  **Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** A well-known result from Gauss's law is that the electric field at an external point (at a distance `L` from the center) due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field of a point charge of the same total magnitude placed at the center of the sphere.\n\n9.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge creating the external field is `+q`.\n    *   This charge can be treated as a point charge located at the center of the large spherical conductor (let's call it O).\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is given as `L`.\n    *   The magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's Law:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n10. **Conclusion:** The information about the cavity's radius `r`, its offset `s`, the distance `l`, and the angle `\\theta` are all extraneous details. They do not affect the electric field outside the conductor due to the principle of electrostatic shielding. The external field only depends on the total charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity. A positive charge `+q` is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Induction of Charges:** The presence of the positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile electrons in the conductor to redistribute themselves.\n    *   Electrons will be attracted towards the `+q` charge, accumulating on the inner surface of the cavity. To completely cancel the electric field from the `+q` charge *within the conductor material*, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law applied to a Gaussian surface drawn entirely within the conducting material and enclosing the cavity. Since the electric field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero, the net enclosed charge must be zero.\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has accumulated on the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality. This `+q` charge will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is that they provide electrostatic shielding. The cavity and its contents (the original `+q` charge and the induced `-q` on the inner wall) are completely shielded from the outside region by the conducting material. This means the arrangement of charges inside the cavity has no effect on the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The charge `+q` that appears on the outer surface will distribute itself in a way that minimizes repulsion. Since the conductor is spherical and isolated from any other external fields (the internal field is shielded), the `+q` charge will spread out uniformly over the outer spherical surface.\n\n5.  **Calculating the External Electric Field:** Now, we need to find the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor. The field at P is the superposition of the fields from all charges. However, due to shielding, the net effect of the charges inside the cavity (the original `+q` and the induced `-q`) on the field outside is zero. Therefore, the only charge that contributes to the electric field at point P is the `+q` charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** According to a well-known result from electrostatics (derivable from Gauss's Law), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a single point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of this charge distribution is the center of the spherical conductor.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is the same as that of a point charge `+q` at a distance `L`:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The distances `l` and `s`, and the angle `theta`, which describe the specific location of the charge within the cavity and the location of point P relative to the cavity, are irrelevant for determining the electric field outside the conductor. The correct expression only depends on the total charge `q` and the distance `L` from the center of the conductor.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have a spherical conductor that is initially uncharged. It contains an off-center spherical cavity. A positive point charge, `+q`, is placed somewhere inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field `E` at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply Principles of Electrostatics for Conductors:**\n    *   **Electric Field Inside a Conductor:** In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the bulk material of a conductor must be zero.\n    *   **Gauss's Law:** The net electric flux through any closed surface (a Gaussian surface) is proportional to the total electric charge enclosed by that surface ($\\Phi_E = \\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$).\n    *   **Induced Charges:** The presence of the charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute themselves.\n\n3.  **Charge Distribution - Inner Surface:**\n    *   Consider a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity.\n    *   Since the electric field `E` must be zero everywhere on this Gaussian surface (as it's inside the conductor), the total electric flux through this surface is zero.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, this means the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge `+q` placed inside the cavity and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity (`q_inner`).\n    *   Therefore, `+q + q_inner = 0`, which implies `q_inner = -q`.\n    *   So, a total charge of `-q` is induced on the wall of the cavity. This induced charge `-q` will distribute itself non-uniformly on the inner surface to perfectly cancel the electric field produced by the point charge `+q` for all points outside the cavity (i.e., within the conductor and beyond).\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution - Outer Surface:**\n    *   The conductor was initially electrically neutral.\n    *   Since a charge of `-q` was induced on the inner surface (by drawing electrons from the conductor), a net charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain overall neutrality.\n    *   This excess charge of `+q` will reside on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   Crucially, the charges on the outer surface are shielded from the electric field of the charges inside the cavity (`+q` and the induced `-q`). This phenomenon is known as electrostatic shielding or the Faraday cage effect.\n    *   Because the outer surface is a perfect sphere and it is shielded from the asymmetrically placed charges inside, the induced charge `+q` will distribute itself *uniformly* over the outer surface to minimize its potential energy.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   Point P is outside the spherical conductor. The electric field at P is the vector sum of the fields from all charges in the system:\n        *   The original charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n        *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner cavity surface.\n        *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer conductor surface.\n    *   Due to the electrostatic shielding, the net electric field at any point outside the cavity due to the combination of the original charge `+q` and the induced inner-surface charge `-q` is exactly zero.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is solely determined by the uniformly distributed charge `+q` on the outer spherical surface.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (a consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the field of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case, the charge on the outer surface is `+q`, and the center of this spherical surface is the center of the conductor, O.\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is given as `L`.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Treating the `+q` on the outer surface as a point charge at the center O, the magnitude of the electric field at P is given by Coulomb's Law:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The final expression for the electric field at P is independent of the cavity's size (`r`), its position (`s`), the exact location of the charge `q` within the cavity, the distance `l`, and the angle `\\theta`. It only depends on the magnitude of the charge `q` and the distance `L` from the center of the conductor. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor. This conductor is a solid object with a cavity inside. A positive charge, `+q`, is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P *outside* the conductor.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Induction:** The presence of the charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute themselves. This phenomenon is called electrostatic induction.\n    *   Since the charge `+q` is positive, it will attract the free electrons in the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. A total charge of `-q` will be induced on this inner surface.\n    *   **Why -q?** We can apply Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity. In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field `E` inside the conducting material must be zero. Therefore, the electric flux through this Gaussian surface is zero. By Gauss's Law (`Φ = Q_enclosed / ε_o`), the total charge enclosed (`Q_enclosed`) must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge `+q` placed in the cavity and the charge induced on the inner wall (`q_inner`). So, `+q + q_inner = 0`, which means `q_inner = -q`.\n\n3.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The problem states that the spherical conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, to conserve the total charge of the conductor, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor. The total charge of the conductor remains `-q + q = 0` (ignoring the `+q` that was added to the cavity). The system (conductor + cavity charge) has a net charge of `+q`.\n\n4.  **Distribution of the Outer Charge and Shielding:** The conducting material acts as an electrostatic shield. This means the charge distribution on the outer surface is completely unaffected by the arrangement of charges inside the cavity (the location of `+q` or the induced `-q`). The charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself as if the inner charges weren't there. Since the outer surface is a sphere and there are no other external fields mentioned, the charge `+q` will spread out *uniformly* over the outer spherical surface.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** A fundamental result from electrostatics (derivable from Gauss's Law, and also known as the Shell Theorem) is that for any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field produced by the shell is identical to the electric field of a single point charge with the same total charge, located at the center of the sphere.\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The outer surface is a sphere, and we can consider its center to be the center of the conductor.\n    *   Point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the conductor.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is the same as that of a point charge `+q` located at the center of the conductor.\n\n    The magnitude of the electric field `E` from a point charge is given by Coulomb's Law:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{(\\text{distance})^2}$\n\n    Substituting our values:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The parameters `r` (cavity radius), `s` (cavity offset), `l` (distance from cavity center to P), and `θ` are irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor.

A positive point charge, $+q$, is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Principle of Electrostatic Induction:**\n    *   The positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. A total charge of $-q$ will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law: if you draw a Gaussian surface within the conducting material, the electric field must be zero, so the net charge enclosed must be zero. This means the charge $+q$ must be balanced by an induced charge of $-q$ on the cavity wall.\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall neutrality, since a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, a charge of $+q$ must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields created by all charges:\n    *   The original point charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle in electrostatics is that a closed conducting surface shields the region outside it from the electric fields of any charges located inside. Let's see why:\n    *   The electric field inside the bulk of the conductor is always zero in electrostatic equilibrium.\n    *   The total field at point P is $\\vec{E}_P = \\vec{E}_{\\text{internal}} + \\vec{E}_{\\text{outer}}$, where $\\vec{E}_{\\text{internal}}$ is the field from the charge $+q$ and the inner surface charge $-q$, and $\\vec{E}_{\\text{outer}}$ is the field from the outer surface charge $+q$.\n    *   It can be proven (using the uniqueness theorem of electrostatics) that the combined electric field produced by the charge inside the cavity ($+q$) and the induced charge on the inner surface ($-q$) is exactly zero everywhere outside the conductor.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined *solely* by the charge distribution on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Field from the Outer Surface Charge:**\n    *   We have a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   The outer surface is a sphere of radius $R$.\n    *   Since there are no other charges or electric fields outside the conductor, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface due to symmetry.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (or by applying Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field of a point charge of the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center O.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The various other parameters given in the problem, such as the cavity's radius ($r$), the position of the cavity's center ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle ($\\theta$), are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They serve as distractors. The conductor completely shields the external point P from the details of the charge arrangement inside the cavity. The only thing that matters externally is the total charge that gets pushed to the outer surface, which is $+q$, and the geometry of that outer surface.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ (Incorrect, uses distance from cavity center)\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ (Correct, uses distance from conductor center)\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complex distractor term)\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complex distractor term)\n\nThe final answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the conductor, it induces charges on the surfaces of the conductor due to electrostatic induction.\n    *   A charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). This happens because the free electrons in the conductor are attracted towards the positive charge `+q`.\n    *   Since the conductor was initially uncharged, its net charge must remain zero. To balance the induced negative charge `-q` on the inner surface, a positive charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the material of the conductor is zero. The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface arranges itself in such a way that it completely cancels the electric field produced by the charge `+q` for all points outside the cavity (i.e., inside the conductor material and outside the conductor). This phenomenon is known as electrostatic shielding.\n\n3.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** The electric field at the point P, which is outside the conductor, is the superposition of the fields from all charges present. These are:\n    *   The original charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface.\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n\n    Due to the shielding effect mentioned in step 2, the net electric field at point P from the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero. Therefore, the only charge that contributes to the electric field at point P is the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Field from the Outer Surface Charge:** The outer surface of the conductor is a sphere of radius `R`. The induced charge `+q` on this surface will distribute itself uniformly, regardless of the position of the cavity or the charge inside it. This is because the inner charges are shielded from the outer surface by the conducting material.\n\n5.  **Applying Gauss's Law:** For a spherically symmetric charge distribution (like the uniform `+q` on the outer surface), the electric field at an external point is the same as if the entire charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the outer spherical surface is the center of the conductor, O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center O.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Therefore, the electric field at point P is equivalent to the field of a point charge `+q` located at O.

In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside a conductor must be zero. Therefore, the net electric flux through this Gaussian surface is zero. By Gauss's Law ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_o}$), the total charge enclosed by this surface must be zero. Since the charge `+q` is inside the cavity, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity to make the net enclosed charge zero (`+q` + `-q` = 0).\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (zero net charge). Since a charge of `-q` has been induced on the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge conservation (net charge = 0 + (`-q`) + (`+q`) = 0).\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A crucial property of conductors is electrostatic shielding. The conductor material shields the region outside it from the electric fields created by charges inside the cavity. The combined electric field produced by the point charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner wall is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** As a result of the shielding effect, the electric field at any point P outside the conductor is solely due to the charge distribution on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** We have a total charge of `+q` on the outer surface. Since this surface is a sphere and there are no other external charges, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface of the conductor. The location of the cavity and the charge inside it do not affect this uniform distribution on the outer surface because of the shielding.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell at an external point is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude placed at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer surface = `+q`.\n    *   Center of the outer sphere = Center of the conductor (let's call it O).\n    *   Distance of the point P from the center O = `L`.\n\n8.  **Final Formula:** Using Coulomb's Law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe information about the cavity's radius `r`, its distance `s` from the center, the distance `l` from the cavity's center to P, and the angle `\\theta` are all extraneous details designed to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding.

This induced charge `-q` arranges itself on the inner surface to perfectly cancel the electric field produced by the `+q` charge for all points outside the cavity but within the conductor.\n    *   The spherical conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain its overall neutrality.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. This means that the charges inside the conductor (the original `+q` in the cavity and the induced `-q` on the cavity wall) do not produce any electric field outside the conductor. The electric field outside the conductor is determined solely by the charge distribution on its outer surface.\n\n3.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly. This is because the outer surface is a perfect sphere, and it is shielded from the non-symmetrical arrangement of the charge `+q` and the cavity inside. The charges on the outer surface will spread out as far as possible from each other, resulting in a uniform spherical distribution.\n\n4.  **Electric Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** A well-known result from Gauss's law is that the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell (or a solid sphere with a spherically symmetric charge distribution) is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at a point charge at its center.\n\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of this spherical surface is the center of the conductor, O.\n    *   The point P is located at a distance `L` from the center O.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field `E` at point P is equivalent to the field of a point charge `+q` located at O.

They accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface within the material of the conductor that encloses the cavity, the electric field on this surface must be zero (as it's inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). For the field to be zero, the net charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity to cancel out the `+q` charge.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding positive charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain its overall neutrality. This `+q` charge will reside on the outer surface of the conductor, as charges in a conductor move to its surfaces.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it. The charge distribution on the inner surface (`-q`) arranges itself in such a way that its electric field, combined with the electric field of the point charge `+q`, results in a zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity. This ensures that the electric field inside the bulk material of the conductor is zero.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** Because the combined field of the charge `+q` in the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero outside the cavity, the electric field at the external point P is solely due to the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The outer surface of the conductor is a sphere of radius `R`. This outer surface is shielded from the non-uniform arrangement of charges inside the cavity. With no other external electric fields present, the charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly over the sphere.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field (Shell Theorem):** According to the shell theorem (which is a consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field at an external point due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the electric field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is the point from which the distance `L` is measured.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge `q` at the center of the conductor:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The details about the cavity's size (`r`), its position (`s`), the exact location of the charge `+q` within the cavity, the distance from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle `θ` are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the shielding effect.

The charges on the inner surface (`-q`) and the charge within the cavity (`+q`) arrange themselves in such a way that their combined electric field is zero everywhere outside the cavity. This means the charge distribution on the outer surface is completely unaffected by the position of the cavity or the charge inside it. Because the outer surface is a perfect sphere, the induced charge `+q` will distribute itself **uniformly** over the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:** The total electric field at point P is the superposition of the fields from all charges:\n    *   The original charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Applying the Shielding Concept:** As stated in step 3, the net electric field at point P due to the original charge `+q` and the induced inner surface charge `-q` is zero. Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined solely by the charge `+q` that is uniformly distributed on the outer spherical surface.\n\n6.  **Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** According to Gauss's Law (or the shell theorem), the electric field at an external point (a point outside the sphere) due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the outer spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is `L`.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Using the formula for the electric field of a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{\\text{(distance from center})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$: Incorrect.

This means the net charge on the conductor is zero. It has a cavity inside.\n\n2.  **Introduce the charge:** A positive charge, $+q$, is placed inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Induction on the inner surface:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges (free electrons) within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface entirely within the conducting material, the electric field must be zero everywhere on this surface. For the field to be zero, the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. This implies that the total charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity must be equal and opposite to the charge placed inside it. Therefore, a charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this $-q$ charge on the inner surface will be non-uniform, arranged in such a way as to cancel the electric field produced by the $+q$ charge for all points within the conductor.\n\n4.  **Induction on the outer surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral. Since a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, a net positive charge of $+q$ must be left behind on the conductor to maintain overall charge conservation (the initial net charge was zero). This excess positive charge, $+q$, will reside on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Distribution of charge on the outer surface:** A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conducting material is zero. This has a powerful consequence known as electrostatic shielding. The conductor material effectively shields the outer surface from the electric fields created by the charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$). As a result, the charge $+q$ on the outer surface is not influenced by the position of the cavity or the charge within it. It will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface to minimize repulsion, just as if it were the only charge present on an isolated spherical conductor.\n\n6.  **Calculating the electric field outside the conductor:** We need to find the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor. The total electric field at P is the vector sum of the fields produced by:\n    a. The charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n    b. The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface.\n    c. The induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface.\n\n7.  **Applying the shielding principle:** Due to electrostatic shielding, the net electric field produced by the charge inside the cavity ($+q$) and the charge on the inner surface ($-q$) is zero for all points outside the cavity. So, for point P, we only need to consider the electric field generated by the charge on the outer surface.\n\n8.  **Field from the outer surface charge:** We have a charge of $+q$ distributed uniformly over a spherical surface of radius $R$. According to the Shell Theorem (a consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n\n9.  **Final Calculation:** The problem states that point P is at a distance $L$ from the center of the spherical conductor. Therefore, the electric field at P is equivalent to the field from a point charge $+q$ located at the conductor's center.

For the net electric flux through this surface to be zero, the total charge enclosed must be zero. Since there is a charge `+q` inside the cavity, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This induced charge `-q` will distribute itself on the inner surface in such a way that it, together with the original charge `+q`, creates zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity, specifically within the conducting material.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged.

Since the outer surface is a sphere and it is isolated (no other external charges are mentioned), the charge `+q` will spread out uniformly over the entire outer surface.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Electric Field outside the conductor:**\n    The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges. However, due to the shielding effect, the net electric field produced by the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero everywhere outside the cavity. Therefore, the electric field at point P is solely due to the uniform distribution of charge `+q` on the outer spherical surface.\n\n5.  **Use the Shell Theorem:**\n    The Shell Theorem (a direct result of Gauss's Law) states that the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as that of a point charge with the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the outer sphere is the center of the conductor, let's call it O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center O.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Applying the formula for the electric field of a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{\\text{(distance)}^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The information about the cavity's radius `r`, its distance `s` from the center, the distance `l` from the cavity's center to P, and the angle `\\theta` are all distractors.

This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law: if you draw a Gaussian surface inside the conductor material, enclosing the cavity, the electric field must be zero. For the net flux to be zero, the total enclosed charge must be zero. Thus, `q_enclosed = (+q) + q_inner_surface = 0`, which implies `q_inner_surface = -q`.\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged (net charge = 0).

Inside this conductor, there is an off-center spherical cavity. A point charge of +q is placed somewhere within this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply the properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium:** A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the material of the conductor must be zero.\n\n3.  **Consider the effect of the charge +q in the cavity (Gauss's Law):** Let's imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity. Since the electric field everywhere on this Gaussian surface is zero, the total electric flux through it is zero. According to Gauss's Law ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$), the total charge enclosed by this surface must be zero. The enclosed charge consists of the point charge +q inside the cavity and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity ($q_{inner}$).\n    Therefore, $q + q_{inner} = 0$, which implies $q_{inner} = -q$. A total charge of -q gets induced on the inner wall of the cavity.\n\n4.  **Consider the charge on the outer surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). After the charge induction, a charge of -q has appeared on its inner surface. To maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor itself, a charge of +q must appear on its outer surface. So, we have:\n    *   Charge inside the cavity: +q\n    *   Charge on the inner surface of the conductor: -q\n    *   Charge on the outer surface of the conductor: +q\n    The net charge of the conductor remains zero (-q + q = 0), and the total charge of the whole system is +q.\n\n5.  **Principle of Electrostatic Shielding:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the vector sum of the fields produced by all three charge distributions: the +q in the cavity, the -q on the inner surface, and the +q on the outer surface.\n    A crucial consequence of the E=0 property inside a conductor is electrostatic shielding. The charges within the cavity (+q) and on the cavity wall (-q) arrange themselves in such a way that their combined electric field is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity. This ensures the field within the conductor remains zero. Therefore, for any point P outside the conductor, the contribution to the electric field from the charge +q in the cavity and the induced charge -q on the inner surface is zero.\n\n6.  **Calculate the field from the outer surface charge:** This means the electric field at point P is solely due to the charge +q residing on the outer surface of the spherical conductor. Since there are no external electric fields and the outer surface is a perfect sphere, this charge +q will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface to minimize electrostatic potential energy.\n\n7.  **Apply the Shell Theorem:** According to the shell theorem (which is a direct result of Gauss's Law), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge on the shell were concentrated into a single point charge at its center.\n    *   The total charge on the outer shell is +q.\n    *   The center of the shell is the center of the spherical conductor.\n    *   The distance of point P from the center of the conductor is L.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** The magnitude of the electric field at point P is therefore given by the formula for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The radius of the cavity (r), the displacement of its center (s), the distance of P from the cavity's center (l), and the angle ($\\theta$) are all extraneous pieces of information designed to test the understanding of the core concept of electrostatic shielding.

A positive charge, $+q$, is placed inside a spherical cavity within the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply the principles of Electrostatics for Conductors:**\n    *   **Electric Field inside a Conductor:** In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the bulk material of a conductor must be zero.\n    *   **Charge Induction:** The presence of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity will cause the mobile charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute themselves.\n\n3.  **Charge Distribution on the Inner Surface (Cavity Wall):**\n    *   To make the electric field zero inside the conductor's material, a charge must be induced on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity).\n    *   Consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity. According to Gauss's law, the total electric flux through this surface is $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$.\n    *   Since the electric field $\\vec{E}$ is zero everywhere inside the conductor, the flux is zero. This implies that the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface, $Q_{enclosed}$, must also be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge placed inside the cavity ($+q$) and the charge induced on the inner surface ($q_{inner}$). So, $+q + q_{inner} = 0$.\n    *   This means a charge of $q_{inner} = -q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This induced charge will distribute itself on the inner surface in a way that its field, combined with the field of the point charge $+q$, results in a zero field everywhere outside the cavity (specifically, within the conductor).\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral).\n    *   We have just established that a charge of $-q$ has been drawn to the inner surface.\n    *   To maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else. Since charges can only reside on the surfaces of a conductor in equilibrium, this charge of $+q$ must reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):**\n    *   A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it. The arrangement of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface produces zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, the charge distribution on the outer surface is not affected by the positions of the cavity or the charge $+q$ within it.\n    *   The charge $+q$ on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly over the sphere, as this is the lowest energy configuration for a charge on an isolated spherical conductor.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   The electric field at point P (outside the conductor) is the vector sum of the fields from all charges: the original charge $+q$, the inner surface charge $-q$, and the outer surface charge $+q$.\n    *   Due to the shielding effect, the net field at P from the charge inside the cavity ($+q$) and the charge on the inner surface ($-q$) is zero.\n    *   Thus, the electric field at P is produced *solely* by the uniform distribution of charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (a consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the field of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.

A positive charge $+q$ is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply the principle of charge induction:** The positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. In electrostatic equilibrium, these charges will move to the surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface inside the conducting material enclosing the cavity, the electric field must be zero. For the field to be zero, the net charge enclosed must be zero. Therefore, a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner wall of the cavity to cancel out the $+q$ charge inside it.\n\n3.  **Consider the overall charge of the conductor:** The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, to maintain charge conservation, a charge of $+q$ must appear on the outer surface of the conductor. This is because the total charge of the conductor must remain zero.\n\n4.  **Analyze the distribution of charge on the outer surface:** The charge $+q$ on the outer surface will distribute itself to reach electrostatic equilibrium. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external charges mentioned in the problem, this charge $+q$ will spread out uniformly over the entire outer surface. The complex arrangement inside the cavity (the position of the charge $+q$, the shape and position of the cavity) does not affect the charge distribution on the outer surface. This is the principle of electrostatic shielding – the conductor's bulk shields the outer surface from the electrostatic details of the interior.\n\n5.  **Calculate the electric field at point P:** The electric field at any point outside the conductor is the field produced by the charge on its outer surface. We have a total charge of $+q$ distributed uniformly on a spherical surface of radius $R$.

These electrons will accumulate on the surface of the cavity. This creates an induced charge of `-q` on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this `-q` charge on the inner surface will be non-uniform, arranged in such a way as to cancel the electric field of the `+q` charge for all points inside the conductor's material.\n    *   **Induction on the outer surface:** Since the conductor was initially neutral, and a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a net positive charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere in the conductor to maintain charge conservation. This excess positive charge (`+q`) will reside on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply the principle of Electrostatic Shielding:**\n    *   A fundamental property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the material of the conductor must be zero.\n    *   The arrangement of the `+q` charge inside the cavity and the induced `-q` charge on the inner surface is such that their combined electric field is zero everywhere outside the cavity, specifically within the conducting material.\n    *   This means the conductor \"shields\" the outside region from the electrostatic influence of the charges inside the cavity.

This means the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface will **not** be distributed uniformly. It will be denser on the parts of the wall closer to `+q`.\n    *   However, the charge `+q` on the **outer surface** is a different story. The conductor's bulk acts as an electrostatic shield. The charges on the outer surface are shielded from the specific arrangement of charges inside the cavity. Because the outer surface is a perfect sphere, the charge `+q` will distribute itself **uniformly** over this outer surface to minimize repulsion, regardless of the cavity's position or the charge's position within it.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P (Outside):** The total electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges:\n    *   The original charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface.\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n\n6.  **The Shielding Effect:** A fundamental theorem of electrostatics states that for any point outside a closed conducting shell, the electric field due to the charges *inside* the shell and the charges induced on the *inner surface* of the shell is exactly zero. In our case, the field at P due to the `+q` in the cavity and the `-q` on the cavity wall cancels out completely.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Therefore, the electric field at the external point P is due **only** to the charge `+q` distributed on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   We have a total charge of `+q` distributed uniformly on a spherical surface of radius `R`.\n    *   According to another key result from Gauss's law (often called the Shell Theorem), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The distance of point P from the center O is `L`.\n\n    Thus, the magnitude of the electric field at P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The information regarding the cavity's radius (`r`), the position of its center (`s`), the distance from the cavity's center to P (`l`), and the angle `theta` are all extraneous details designed to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding.

This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law: if we draw a Gaussian surface inside the conductive material enclosing the cavity, the electric field inside the conductor must be zero. For this to be true, the net charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must be zero. Since there is a charge of `+q` inside, the induced charge on the inner wall must be `-q`.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (uncharged). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it provides electrostatic shielding. The charges on the outer surface are shielded from the electric fields created by the charges inside the cavity (the original charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the inner wall). Conversely, the region inside the cavity is shielded from any external electric fields.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** We have a total charge of `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor. Since this outer surface is a sphere and it is shielded from the non-symmetrical arrangement inside the cavity, and there are no other external charges mentioned, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface.

This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have an electrically neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor. Inside this conductor, there is a spherical cavity. A positive point charge, +q, is placed somewhere inside this cavity.\n\n2.  **Principle of Electrostatic Induction:** The presence of the positive charge +q inside the cavity will affect the free electrons within the conductor.\n    *   The positive charge +q will attract the free electrons in the conductor. These electrons will move and accumulate on the surface of the cavity. This creates an induced negative charge on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity).\n    *   To determine the total amount of this induced negative charge, we can apply Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity.\n    *   A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conducting material must be zero ($\\vec{E}_{conductor} = 0$).\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through our Gaussian surface is $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$. Since $\\vec{E} = 0$ everywhere on this surface, the total flux is zero. This implies that the total charge enclosed by the surface, $Q_{enclosed}$, must also be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge +q and the induced charge on the inner surface, $q_{inner}$. So, $Q_{enclosed} = +q + q_{inner} = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the induced charge on the inner surface of the cavity is $q_{inner} = -q$.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially uncharged (net charge = 0). After the charge induction, a charge of -q has accumulated on the inner surface. Since charge must be conserved, a corresponding positive charge must appear elsewhere in the conductor.\n    *   Charge in a conductor resides on its surfaces. Thus, a charge of +q must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n    *   Total charge of the conductor = $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = -q + (+q) = 0$. This is consistent with the initial condition.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):** The conductor material effectively shields the outer surface from the electric field produced by the charges inside the cavity (+q and the induced -q). The arrangement of the charge +q and the induced charge -q on the inner wall is such that their combined electric field is zero everywhere outside the cavity, including within the conductor and outside the conductor.\n    *   This means the distribution of the +q charge on the *outer surface* is not affected by the position of the cavity (s), the size of the cavity (r), or the exact location of the charge +q within the cavity.\n    *   Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external electric fields, the +q charge will distribute itself *uniformly* over the outer surface.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields from all charges:\n    *   Field from the point charge +q inside the cavity.\n    *   Field from the induced charge -q on the inner surface.\n    *   Field from the induced charge +q on the outer surface.\n\n    As established by the principle of shielding, the net electric field at P from the first two sources (the +q charge in the cavity and the -q charge on the cavity wall) is zero.\n\n    Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined solely by the +q charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Shell Theorem:** For a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge on the shell were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case, we have a total charge of +q distributed uniformly on the outer surface (a sphere of radius R).\n    *   The point P is located at a distance L from the center of this sphere.\n    *   Using Coulomb's law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at P is:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{(\\text{Total charge on outer surface})}{(\\text{distance from center})^2}$\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The parameters describing the cavity's geometry and location (r, s), the distance from the cavity's center (l), and the angle ($\\theta$) are irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to electrostatic shielding.

Let's break down the physics step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Initial State:** We have an electrically neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor. This means the net charge of the conductor is zero.\n\n2.  **Placing a Charge Inside the Cavity:** A point charge of `+q` is placed inside the cavity. This charge will create an electric field.\n\n3.  **Induced Charges:** Conductors contain mobile charges (electrons) that are free to move. In the presence of the electric field from the `+q` charge, these mobile charges will redistribute themselves.\n    *   **Inner Surface:** Negative charges within the conductor will be attracted to the positive charge `+q`. They will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. To completely shield the interior of the conductor from the field of `+q`, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law applied to a surface just inside the conductor material, where the electric field must be zero. The total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero, so `q_{enclosed} = q_{point\\_charge} + q_{inner\\_surface} = +q + q_{inner\\_surface} = 0`, which implies `q_{inner\\_surface} = -q`.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a net positive charge of `+q` must be left behind elsewhere on the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality. These positive charges will repel each other and move as far apart as possible, which means they will distribute themselves on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges located inside it. The arrangement of the `-q` charge on the inner cavity surface precisely cancels the field from the `+q` charge for all points outside the cavity. Consequently, the charge distribution on the outer surface is not affected by the positions of the charges inside the cavity (`+q` and the induced `-q`).\n\n5.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Since the `+q` charge on the outer surface is shielded from the asymmetrically located cavity and internal charge, and because the conductor itself is spherical, this `+q` charge will distribute itself **uniformly** over the outer spherical surface of radius `R`.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:** We need to find the electric field `E` at a point P, which is outside the conductor. The total electric field at P is the superposition of the fields from all charges: the `+q` inside the cavity, the `-q` on the inner surface, and the `+q` on the outer surface.\n    However, we can use a powerful simplification from Gauss's Law known as the **Shell Theorem**. For any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is the same as if all the charge on the shell were concentrated into a single point charge at its center.\n    *   The charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   It is distributed uniformly on a sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   The center of this sphere is the center of the conductor, O.\n    *   The field at point P, at a distance `L` from the center O, is therefore equivalent to the field of a point charge `+q` located at O.\n    *   Also, due to shielding, the net electric field at P from the combination of the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall is zero.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Using Coulomb's Law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n    The effective charge is `+q` located at the center O.

This is a classic example of electrostatic shielding.\n\nComparing our result with the given options, we find that it matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThis is a classic problem in electrostatics involving conductors and cavities. Let's break down the physics step-by-step.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor. This means its net electric charge is zero. It has a cavity inside, which is also initially empty and uncharged.\n\n2.  **Introducing the charge:** A positive charge `+q` is placed somewhere inside the spherical cavity. This is the crucial action that sets up the electric fields.\n\n3.  **Induction of charges:**\n    *   **On the inner surface (cavity wall):** The positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, the electric field inside the material of the conductor must be zero. If we draw a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity, the total charge inside this Gaussian surface must be zero for the field to be zero. Since there is a `+q` charge placed in the cavity, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This induced charge `-q` will distribute itself non-uniformly on the cavity wall to ensure the electric field from itself and the charge `+q` cancel out completely within the conductor.\n\n    *   **On the outer surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged (neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has moved from the bulk of the conductor to the inner surface, a net positive charge of `+q` must be left behind. As there can be no static charge within the bulk of a conductor, this excess charge `+q` must reside on the outermost surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Distribution of the outer charge:** The crucial concept here is **electrostatic shielding**. The conducting material shields the outside region from the electric field produced by the charges inside the cavity (the original `+q` and the induced `-q`). Consequently, the distribution of the charge `+q` on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the cavity or the position of the charge `+q` within it. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external fields, the charge `+q` will distribute itself **uniformly** over the surface of the large sphere of radius `R`.\n\n5.  **Calculating the electric field outside:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields from all charges present:\n    *   The original charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface.\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n\n    However, due to the shielding effect, the net electric field produced by the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero everywhere outside the cavity. A more precise statement is that the field at point P is the field produced by the charge distribution on the outer surface only.\n\n    So, we only need to calculate the electric field produced by the charge `+q` distributed uniformly on the outer spherical surface of radius `R`.\n\n6.  **Applying Shell Theorem (or Gauss's Law):** For a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge of the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer shell = `+q`.\n    *   Center of the outer sphere = Center of the conductor, O.\n    *   Point of measurement = P.\n    *   Distance from the center O to the point P = `L`.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by the formula for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{(\\text{distance})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Evaluating the given information:** The problem provides several other parameters: the radius of the cavity `r`, the distance of the cavity's center from the conductor's center `s`, the distance of P from the cavity's center `l`, and an angle `\\theta`. As established by the reasoning above, due to electrostatic shielding, none of these details about the cavity's location or the charge's position within it affect the electric field outside the conductor. This information is extraneous and intended to be a distraction. The only quantities that matter are the charge `q` and the distance `L` from the center of the *conductor*.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Comparing our result with the given options:\n    A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n    B) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n    C) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n    D) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity.

Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, to maintain overall charge neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key concept here is electrostatic shielding. A conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of charges placed inside it. The details of the charge configuration inside the cavity (the exact position of `+q`, the shape and position of the cavity) do not affect the electric field *outside* the conductor.\n    *   The total electric field at any point is the superposition of the fields from all charges: the original charge `+q`, the induced inner surface charge `-q`, and the induced outer surface charge `+q`.\n    *   Let's consider the combined effect of the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface. This pair of charges creates an electric field that is non-zero inside the cavity, but is *exactly zero* everywhere outside the cavity (i.e., within the conductor material and outside the conductor).\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is determined *solely* by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   We've established that a total charge of `+q` resides on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external electric fields, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the surface. The internal asymmetric configuration is completely shielded from the outer surface by the conducting material. The charges on the outer surface will arrange themselves to make the potential constant, which for an isolated sphere results in a uniform distribution.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   The problem now simplifies to finding the electric field at point P due to a uniformly charged spherical shell of radius `R` with a total charge `+q`.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (or Gauss's Law), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the electric field produced by a single point charge of the same total magnitude, located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case:\n        *   The total charge on the outer shell is `+q`.\n        *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n        *   The distance of the point P from the center O is `L`.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge `+q` at O:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Given Information:**\n    *   The problem provides several other parameters: the radius of the cavity `r`, the distance of the cavity's center from the conductor's center `s`, the distance of P from the cavity's center `l`, and an angle `\\theta`.\n    *   Based on the principle of electrostatic shielding, all of this information (`r`, `s`, `l`, `\\theta`) is irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor.

It has a cavity inside.\n\n2.  **Introduce the charge:** A positive charge, `+q`, is placed inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** The presence of the positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. To understand the total amount of induced charge, we can use Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity. The electric field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero. According to Gauss's Law, the net electric flux through this surface is zero, which implies that the total electric charge enclosed by the surface must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge `+q` placed inside and the charge induced on the inner cavity wall ($q_{inner}$).\n    $q_{enclosed} = +q + q_{inner} = 0$\n    Therefore, the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity is $q_{inner} = -q$. The distribution of this `-q` charge will be non-uniform, arranged to precisely cancel the field from `+q` within the conductor material.\n\n4.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor ($q_{outer}$).\n    Total charge on conductor = $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = -q + q_{outer} = 0$ (since the conductor itself was uncharged)\n    This gives $q_{outer} = +q$.\n\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of a closed conducting shell is that it provides electrostatic shielding. This means:\n    *   The charges inside the cavity (the original `+q` and the induced `-q` on the inner wall) produce zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity.\n    *   The charge on the outer surface (`+q`) distributes itself completely independently of the arrangement of charges inside the cavity.\n\n6.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The `+q` charge on the outer surface will spread out to minimize repulsion. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere, the charge will distribute itself uniformly over this surface.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The point P is outside the conductor. The total electric field at P is the sum of the fields from all charges:\n    *   The field from the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner wall. As stated by the principle of electrostatic shielding, the net field from these two at any point outside the cavity is zero.\n    *   The field from the induced charge `+q` which is distributed uniformly on the outer spherical surface of radius R.\n\n    Therefore, the electric field at point P is solely due to the uniform spherical shell of charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n\n8.  **Applying the Shell Theorem:** The shell theorem (a result derived from Gauss's Law) states that the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer shell = `+q`.\n    *   Center of the shell = Center of the conductor, O.\n    *   Distance of point P from the center O = `L`.\n\n    Thus, the magnitude of the electric field at P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q_{outer}}{L^2} = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n9.  **Conclusion on other variables:** The information about the cavity's position (`s`), the distance of P from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle `\\theta` are all distractors. Due to electrostatic shielding, the details of the cavity's geometry and the charge's position within it do not influence the electric field outside the conductor. The external field only depends on the total charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the outer sphere.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ (Incorrect, uses distance from cavity center)\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complex distance)\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ (Correct)\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complex distance)\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor with an off-center spherical cavity.

We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction:** The presence of the charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile electrons in the conductor to redistribute themselves. This is known as electrostatic induction.\n    *   **Inner Surface:** To shield the conducting material from the electric field of the charge `+q`, a charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, if we imagine a Gaussian surface just inside the bulk of the conductor enclosing the cavity, the electric field must be zero. This implies the net charge enclosed by this surface must be zero. Since there is `+q` inside the cavity, a total charge of `-q` must accumulate on the inner wall of the cavity.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (uncharged). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain its overall neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it. The electric field at any point outside the cavity, produced by the sum of the charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall, is zero.\n    Therefore, the electric field at point P outside the main conductor is caused *only* by the charge present on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The charge on the outer surface is `+q`. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external charges in the vicinity, this induced charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface to be in electrostatic equilibrium. The non-uniform arrangement inside the conductor (the off-center cavity and charge) has no effect on the distribution of charge on the outer surface because of the shielding effect of the conducting material.\n\n5.  **Electric Field outside a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** A fundamental result from Gauss's Law (also known as the Shell Theorem) is that for any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the outer spherical surface is the center of the conductor, O.\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is `L`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Electric Field:** Using the principle from step 5, the electric field `E` at point P is the same as the field produced by a point charge `+q` located at the center O of the conductor.

The charge distribution on the inner surface (`-q`) arranges itself in such a way that its field perfectly cancels the field of the internal charge `+q` for all points outside the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P due to the combination of the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the charge `-q` on the inner wall is zero.\n    *   This leaves only the field produced by the `+q` charge on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Calculate the field from the outer charge:**\n    *   The charge `+q` on the outer surface is on an isolated spherical conductor.

This means the net charge of the conductor is zero. Inside this conductor, there is a cavity.\n\n2.  **Placing the charge:** A positive charge, $+q$, is placed somewhere inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges (electrons) in the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity, the electric field inside the conductor must be zero. For the electric field to be zero, the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. This means the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity must be exactly equal and opposite to the charge placed inside. Therefore, a charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner wall of the cavity.\n\n4.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else on the conductor. These positive charges (which are essentially the atoms left behind by the migrated electrons) will repel each other and move as far apart as possible. They will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor. Thus, a charge of $+q$ is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of charges inside it. The conducting material between the cavity and the outer surface prevents the electric field from the charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$) from reaching the outside. The net electric field at any point outside the conductor is produced *only* by the charges on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The charge $+q$ on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the charge inside the cavity due to the shielding effect.

This is known as electrostatic induction.\n    *   **Inner Surface (Cavity Wall):** Electrons from the conductor will be attracted towards the `+q` charge. They will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. To completely cancel the electric field from `+q` within the bulk of the conductor (a key property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside them is zero), a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a net charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall charge conservation.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A crucial concept here is electrostatic shielding. The conductor acts as a shield. The charges inside the cavity (the original `+q` and the induced `-q` on the inner surface) are arranged in such a way that their net electric field is zero everywhere outside the cavity. Conversely, the charges on the outer surface (`+q`) produce zero electric field inside the conductor.\n    *   This means that the electric field at point `P` (outside the conductor) is produced *only* by the charge `+q` located on the outer surface of the conductor.

Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external charges nearby, this `+q` charge will spread out uniformly over the entire outer surface.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** According to a well-known result from Gauss's Law (also known as Shell Theorem), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field produced by a point charge of the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is the reference point.\n    *   The point `P` is at a distance `L` from the center of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Final Formula:** Therefore, we can treat the entire conductor as if it were a point charge `+q` located at its center.

So, the total charge on the outer surface is $Q_{outer} = +q$.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):** A crucial property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields the outside region from the electric field of any charges inside it. The combined electric field produced by the point charge +q inside the cavity and the induced charge -q on the inner surface is zero everywhere outside the cavity. Consequently, the distribution of the charge +q on the *outer surface* is not influenced by the position or configuration of charges inside the cavity.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The +q charge on the outer surface will distribute itself in a way that makes the surface an equipotential. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external electric fields, the only way for it to be an equipotential is for the charge +q to be distributed uniformly over its surface.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** A fundamental result from Gauss's law is that the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field of a single point charge with the same total charge, located at the center of the sphere.\n\n6.  **Putting it all Together:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is +q.\n    *   This charge is distributed uniformly.\n    *   The center of the outer spherical surface is the center of the conductor, O.\n    *   The point P where we want to find the field is at a distance L from the center O.\n\n7.  **Calculation:** The electric field at point P is therefore equivalent to the field produced by a point charge +q located at the center O. The magnitude of this field is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{|charge|}{(distance)^2} = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The details about the cavity's radius (r), its position (s), the distance from the cavity's center to P (l), and the angle (θ) are all irrelevant for determining the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the shielding effect. They are distractors.

Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive point charge $+q$ placed inside the cavity will induce an electric field. Since the electric field inside a conductor must be zero in electrostatic equilibrium, charges within the conductor will redistribute themselves to cancel out this field.\n    *   A total charge of $-q$ will be induced on the inner surface of the spherical cavity. This induced charge $-q$ will distribute itself on the inner surface in such a way that the combined electric field of the point charge $+q$ and the induced charge $-q$ is zero everywhere outside the cavity but within the conductor material.\n    *   The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain overall charge neutrality, since a charge of $-q$ has accumulated on the inner surface, a corresponding charge of $+q$ must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a closed conducting shell shields its interior from external electric fields and its exterior from internal electric fields.\n    *   In this case, the conducting material shields the region outside the conductor from the electric field produced by the original charge $+q$ and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is determined *solely* by the charge distributed on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface will spread out to reach an equilibrium configuration. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external charges or fields, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the surface of the large sphere of radius $R$.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell at any point outside the shell is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated as a point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the outer spherical conductor is at a distance $L$ from the point P.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at point P is given by the formula for a point charge:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{(\\text{Distance from center})^2}$\n\n    Substituting the values:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The position of the cavity ($s$), the position of the charge within the cavity, the radius of the cavity ($r$), and the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$) are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the shielding effect.

These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity).\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the electric field inside the material of a conductor must be zero in electrostatic equilibrium. If we imagine a Gaussian surface completely within the conducting material enclosing the cavity, the net electric flux through it must be zero. This implies the net charge enclosed must be zero.\n    *   Since there is a charge of $+q$ inside the cavity, a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity to make the total enclosed charge zero. This induced charge $-q$ arranges itself on the inner surface to perfectly cancel the electric field produced by $+q$ for all points outside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   The conductor was initially electrically neutral (uncharged).\n    *   A charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface.

A total charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity). This is a consequence of Gauss's Law: if you draw a Gaussian surface inside the conducting material, enclosing the cavity, the electric field must be zero everywhere on that surface. This implies the net charge enclosed is zero, so the induced charge on the inner wall must be `-q` to cancel the `+q` inside.\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain overall charge neutrality, since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:**\n    *   A key property of conductors is that they act as electrostatic shields. The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is determined *only* by the charge distribution on the outer surface of the conductor. The internal charges (the original charge `+q` in the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall) are shielded.

This is called electrostatic induction.\n    *   **Inner Surface:** The positive charge `+q` will attract negative charges. A total charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law: if we imagine a Gaussian surface within the conducting material that encloses the cavity, the electric field on this surface must be zero (since it's inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). For the net flux to be zero, the total enclosed charge must be zero. Thus, the charge on the inner wall must be `-q` to cancel the `+q` charge.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding positive charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor. As charges in a conductor can only reside on its surfaces in equilibrium, this `+q` charge will distribute itself on the *outer surface* of the main spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage effect):** A crucial concept here is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it.\n    *   The combined electric field produced by the point charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is exactly zero everywhere *outside* the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, for an observer at point P (which is outside the main conductor and thus definitely outside the cavity), the electric field contribution from the original charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` is zero.\n\n4.  **Field from the Outer Charge:**\n    *   Based on the shielding principle, the only charge that contributes to the electric field at point P is the `+q` charge distributed on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n    *   How is this `+q` charge distributed?

This means the net charge on the conductor is zero. It has a cavity inside.\n2.  **Placing a charge inside the cavity:** A positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity.\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** According to Gauss's Law, the electric field inside the material of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero. If we imagine a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity, the total electric flux through this surface must be zero. This implies that the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, the charge `+q` inside the cavity must induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity. So, a charge of `-q` is induced on the wall of the cavity.\n4.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (uncharged). Since a charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface from the conductor's free electrons, a net charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain overall charge conservation. This `+q` charge will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is electrostatic shielding. The conductor material shields the region outside from the electrostatic influence of the charges inside the cavity. The electric field inside the conductor is zero, effectively isolating the outer surface from the specific arrangement of the charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` within the cavity.\n6.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor will distribute itself in a way that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. For a spherical conductor, the most stable configuration (lowest energy) is a uniform distribution of charge over its surface, regardless of any internal cavities or charges.\n7.  **Calculating the External Electric Field:** Now, we need to find the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor. The electric field at P is the superposition of the fields created by all charges. However, due to shielding, the field at P is solely determined by the charge distribution on the *outer surface* of the conductor. We have established that there is a total charge of `+q` distributed uniformly on the outer spherical surface of radius `R`.\n8.  **Shell Theorem:** According to the Shell Theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the electric field of a single point charge with the same total charge, located at the center of the sphere.\n9.  **Final Calculation:** In our case, the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.

A charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n*   **Charge Induction (Outer Surface) & Charge Conservation:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (zero net charge). We have just \"created\" a charge of `-q` on its inner surface by moving electrons. To maintain overall charge neutrality, an equal amount of positive charge must appear somewhere else. Since charges can only reside on the surfaces of a conductor in equilibrium, a charge of `+q` must be induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n    *   $Q_{total} = q_{inner} + q_{outer} = 0$ (since it was initially uncharged)\n    *   $-q + q_{outer} = 0$\n    *   Therefore, $q_{outer} = +q$.\n\n*   **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage):** A key concept here is electrostatic shielding.

This means the distribution of charge on the outer surface is independent of the position of the charge `+q` within the cavity.\n\n*   **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** We have a total charge of `+q` on the outer surface, which is a sphere of radius `R`. Since there are no other external charges to influence it, and it is shielded from the internal charges, this `+q` charge will distribute itself uniformly over the outer spherical surface.\n\n*   **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** We need to find the electric field at point P, a distance `L` from the center of the conductor.

A positive point charge, $+q$, is placed somewhere inside this cavity.\n\n2.  **Apply the principles of electrostatics for conductors:**\n    *   **Electric Field inside a Conductor:** In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the material of the conductor must be zero.\n    *   **Gauss's Law:** This law relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the net charge enclosed within that surface.\n\n3.  **Determine the induced charges:**\n    *   Consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity. Since the electric field is zero everywhere on this Gaussian surface, the total electric flux through it is zero.\n    *   According to Gauss's law, this means the total charge enclosed by the surface must be zero.\n    *   The charge enclosed consists of the point charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity, let's call it $q_{inner}$.\n    *   Therefore, $+q + q_{inner} = 0$, which implies that the induced charge on the inner surface of the cavity is $q_{inner} = -q$.\n\n4.  **Consider the overall charge of the conductor:**\n    *   The problem states that the spherical conductor was initially uncharged. The total charge of the conductor is the sum of the charge on its inner surface and the charge on its outer surface ($q_{outer}$).\n    *   To maintain its overall neutrality, the total charge on the conductor must remain zero.\n    *   So, $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = 0$.\n    *   Substituting $q_{inner} = -q$, we get $-q + q_{outer} = 0$, which means the charge induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor is $q_{outer} = +q$.\n\n5.  **Determine the electric field outside the conductor:**\n    *   The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges in the system: the original charge $+q$ in the cavity, the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface, and the induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface.\n    *   **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is that they provide electrostatic shielding. The conducting material shields the region outside the conductor from the electric fields of any charges located inside a cavity within it. In other words, the electric field produced by the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface sum to zero for all points outside the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is due *only* to the charge $+q$ residing on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Determine the distribution of charge on the outer surface:**\n    *   The outer surface of the conductor is a sphere of radius $R$. The charge $+q$ on this surface will distribute itself to be in equilibrium.\n    *   Since the conductor is isolated (no other external charges are mentioned) and its outer surface is perfectly spherical, the charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface to minimize electrostatic potential energy. The non-uniformity of the cavity inside does not affect the outer distribution due to the shielding effect of the conductor.\n\n7.  **Calculate the electric field at point P:**\n    *   The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell at a point outside the shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the shell.\n    *   In our case, the outer surface has a total charge of $+q$, is spherical, and is centered at the center of the conductor.

We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the entire conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply Gauss's Law and Properties of Conductors:**\n    *   A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conductor's material must be zero.\n    *   Let's consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor, enclosing the cavity.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through this surface is equal to the net charge enclosed divided by $\\epsilon_o$ ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = Q_{enc}/\\epsilon_o$).\n    *   Since the electric field $\\vec{E}$ is zero everywhere on this Gaussian surface (as it's inside the conductor), the total flux is zero.\n    *   This implies that the net charge enclosed ($Q_{enc}$) by the Gaussian surface must also be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge placed in the cavity ($+q$) and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity ($q_{inner}$).\n    *   Therefore, $+q + q_{inner} = 0$, which means $q_{inner} = -q$. A charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Conservation on the Conductor:**\n    *   The spherical conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral).\n    *   Since a charge of $-q$ has been induced on the inner surface, to maintain overall neutrality, a charge of $+q$ must appear on the outer surface of the conductor. The total charge of the conductor remains zero ($-q$ on the inner surface + $+q$ on the outer surface = 0).\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:**\n    *   The conductor effectively shields the region outside from the charges inside the cavity. The combined electric field produced by the charge $+q$ (inside the cavity) and the induced charge $-q$ (on the inner surface) is zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is solely due to the charge present on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Field from the Outer Surface Charge:**\n    *   The charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   Because the conductor is spherical and there are no other external electric fields, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface of the sphere of radius $R$. The non-uniform arrangement of charges inside the cavity does not affect the uniform distribution of charge on the outer surface due to the shielding effect of the conductor.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem, the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer shell is $+q$.\n    *   The center of this shell is the center of the conductor.\n    *   The point P is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   The information about the cavity's radius ($r$), its offset from the center ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle ($\\theta$) is all extraneous for calculating the field *outside* the conductor. This information would be needed to find the field *inside* the cavity, but not outside.\n    *   Comparing our derived formula with the given options:\n        A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ (Incorrect, ignores the conductor)\n        B) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complicated and ignores shielding)\n        C) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ (Correct, matches our derivation)\n        D) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complicated and ignores shielding)\n\nThe correct answer is that the field at point P is determined only by the charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have an electrically neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor. This conductor has a cavity inside, which is also spherical but its center is displaced from the center of the conductor. A positive point charge, $+q$, is placed somewhere within this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply the principle of charge induction:**\n    *   The positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity).\n    *   To determine the total charge on this inner surface, we can use Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity.\n    *   A key property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside its material is zero ($\\vec{E}_{conductor} = 0$).\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through our chosen Gaussian surface is zero, because $\\vec{E}=0$ everywhere on the surface. This implies that the net charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must be zero.\n    *   The charge enclosed is the sum of the point charge $+q$ and the induced charge on the inner surface, $q_{inner}$. So, $+q + q_{inner} = 0$.\n    *   This means the total charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity is $q_{inner} = -q$. The distribution of this charge might be non-uniform, depending on the position of $+q$ inside the cavity, but the total amount is exactly $-q$.\n\n3.  **Consider the charge on the outer surface:**\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged (total charge = 0).\n    *   Due to induction, a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface.\n    *   To maintain overall charge neutrality of the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor. This is a consequence of the law of conservation of charge. So, $q_{outer} = +q$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the electric field outside the conductor (Electrostatic Shielding):**\n    *   The total electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges: the point charge $+q$, the charge on the inner surface $q_{inner} = -q$, and the charge on the outer surface $q_{outer} = +q$.\n    *   Let's consider the combined effect of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface. It is a fundamental result of electrostatics (a property of Faraday cages) that the electric field produced by a charge inside a conducting shell and the corresponding induced charge on the inner surface is zero everywhere outside the inner surface.\n    *   Therefore, for the point P which is outside the main conductor (and thus also outside the cavity), the net electric field from the charge $+q$ and the inner surface charge $-q$ is zero.\n    *   This means the electric field at point P is solely due to the charge distribution on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Determine the distribution of the outer charge:**\n    *   The charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   This charge resides on a spherical surface.\n    *   The charges inside the cavity are completely shielded from the outer surface. There are no other external charges in the vicinity.\n    *   Therefore, there are no external electric fields to influence the distribution of charge on the outer surface. To be in a state of stable equilibrium (minimum energy), the charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface.\n\n6.  **Calculate the electric field at point P:**\n    *   The problem now simplifies to finding the electric field at a point P due to a uniformly charged spherical shell of radius $R$ and total charge $+q$.\n    *   A well-known result from Gauss's Law is that the electric field outside a uniformly charged sphere is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge is $+q$. The center is the center of the conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is given as $L$.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The parameters $r$ (radius of the cavity), $s$ (distance between centers), $l$ (distance from cavity center to P), and $\\theta$ are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the principle of electrostatic shielding.

These mobile charges will move and accumulate on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity).\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface inside the conducting material, enclosing the cavity, the electric flux through it must be zero (since $\\vec{E}=0$ inside the conductor). This implies that the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero.\n    *   Therefore, the total charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity must be exactly $-q$ to cancel out the $+q$ charge inside.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Charge:**\n    *   The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. We have induced a charge of $-q$ on its inner surface.\n    *   Since the conductor as a whole is an isolated system, its total charge must remain zero. To conserve charge, a total charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else on the conductor.\n    *   In electrostatics, net charge on a conductor resides on its surfaces. Thus, a charge of $+q$ will appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface (Electrostatic Shielding):**\n    *   The conducting material shields the outer surface from the electric fields created by the charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$).\n    *   This means the distribution of the $+q$ charge on the outer surface is not affected by the specific location of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity or the shape/location of the cavity itself.\n    *   The problem states the outer conductor is a sphere. In the absence of any other external electric fields, the charges on the surface of a spherical conductor will distribute themselves uniformly to be in equilibrium.\n    *   So, we have a total charge of $+q$ distributed uniformly over the outer spherical surface of radius $R$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges:\n        a) The original charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n        b) The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the cavity.\n        c) The induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   A key result of electrostatic shielding is that the combined electric field from the charge inside a cavity (+q) and the charge on the cavity wall (-q) is zero everywhere outside the cavity. This is because this system of charges creates a constant potential on the conductor, which can be shown to lead to zero field outside.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is solely determined by the charge distribution on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   We have established that there is a total charge $+q$ distributed uniformly on the outer spherical surface of radius $R$.\n    *   According to the shell theorem (a direct result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniform spherical shell of charge is identical to the electric field of a point charge of the same total magnitude placed at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center of the spherical conductor.

This means the net charge on the conductor is zero.\n2.  **Introduce the charge:** A positive charge, $+q$, is placed inside the cavity.\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Cavity Wall:** The presence of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor towards it. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface entirely within the conducting material that encloses the cavity, the electric field inside the conductor must be zero. For the net flux through this surface to be zero, the total charge enclosed must be zero. Therefore, a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this $-q$ charge will be non-uniform, arranging itself to perfectly cancel the field of the $+q$ charge for all points outside the cavity.\n4.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially neutral (zero total charge). Since a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, a charge of $+q$ must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain its overall charge neutrality. This $+q$ charge will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is that they provide electrostatic shielding. The charges inside the cavity ($+q$) and on the cavity wall ($-q$) arrange themselves in such a way that their net electric field is zero everywhere outside the cavity. This means an observer outside the conductor cannot tell where the charge $+q$ is located inside the cavity. The only field they experience comes from the charges on the outer surface.\n6.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The charge $+q$ on the outer surface will distribute itself to be in equilibrium. Since the outer surface is a sphere and there are no other external electric fields, the charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** For a spherically symmetric charge distribution (like the uniform $+q$ on the outer surface of the sphere), the electric field at any external point is the same as if the entire charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere (a result from Gauss's Law, often called the Shell Theorem).\n8.  **Final Calculation:** The point P is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the spherical conductor. The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$. Therefore, the electric field at point P is equivalent to the field from a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.

Due to electrostatic induction, this charge will attract negative charges and repel positive charges within the mobile charge sea of the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge induction on the surfaces:**\n    *   **Inner Surface (Cavity Wall):** To cancel the electric field produced by the point charge `+q` inside the bulk of the conductor (a necessary condition for electrostatic equilibrium), a total charge of `-q` gets induced on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this `-q` charge on the inner wall will not be uniform; it will be denser on the parts of the wall closer to the `+q` charge.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface to maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):**\n    A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields the exterior region from the electrostatic effects of any charges placed inside it. The electric field inside the material of the conductor must be zero. This implies that the combined electric field from the point charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface must be zero everywhere outside the cavity, including within the conductor material and in the region outside the conductor.\n    Therefore, the electric field at point P outside the conductor is solely due to the charge `+q` residing on the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Distribution of charge on the outer surface:**\n    The `+q` charge on the outer surface will distribute itself to make the surface an equipotential. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external electric fields, the charge `+q` will spread out uniformly over the outer surface. The non-uniform arrangement of the charge `+q` and the cavity inside does not affect the charge distribution on the outer surface due to the shielding effect of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    The electric field at an external point P due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the electric field produced by a point charge equal to the total charge on the shell, located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is `L`.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The distances `r` (cavity radius), `s` (cavity offset), `l` (distance from P to cavity center), and the angle `θ` are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor.

Let's break down the physics step-by-step.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Initial State:** We start with an uncharged, electrically neutral spherical conductor. This means the total charge of the conductor is zero.\n2.  **Placing a Charge Inside the Cavity:** A positive point charge `+q` is placed somewhere inside the cavity.\n3.  **Induction on the Inner Surface:** According to Gauss's Law, the electric field inside the material of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero. If we consider a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity, the total electric flux through this surface must be zero. This implies that the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must also be zero. Since there is a charge `+q` inside the cavity, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). This induced charge `-q` distributes itself on the inner surface in a way that cancels the electric field from `+q` for all points within the conductor material.\n4.  **Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially neutral. We have just established that a charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface from the free electrons within the conductor. To maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor, a net positive charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere. Since these are conductors, charges are free to move. This excess positive charge will repel itself and move as far apart as possible, which means it will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n5.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The outer surface is a sphere of radius `R`. In the absence of any other external electric fields, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface. This is because a uniform distribution on a sphere is the configuration of minimum electrostatic potential energy.\n6.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields the outside region from the electric fields of any charges inside it. The combined electric field at any point outside the conductor, due to the charge `+q` in the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface, is exactly zero.\n7.  **Calculating the Field Outside:** Therefore, the electric field at point P (which is outside the conductor) is produced *solely* by the charge `+q` that is distributed on the outer surface of the conductor.\n8.  **Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** The electric field at an external point due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is given by the same formula as the electric field from a point charge equal to the total charge on the shell, located at the center of the sphere (this is known as the Shell Theorem).\n9.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the outer spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The distance of the point P from the center O is `L`.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is equivalent to the field of a point charge `+q` at O.\n    *   Using Coulomb's law:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{|charge|}{(distance)^2} = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe parameters `r` (radius of the cavity), `s` (distance between centers), `l` (distance from cavity center to P), and `θ` (angle) are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are provided to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding. The external field only depends on the total charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct expression for the electric field at point P is:\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the setup:** We have an initially uncharged (electrically neutral) spherical conductor of radius $R$. Inside this conductor, there is a spherical cavity of radius $r$. The cavity is off-center, with its center O' being at a distance $s$ from the center O of the main conductor. A point charge of $+q$ is placed somewhere inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field magnitude $E$ at a point P located outside the conductor, at a distance $L$ from the center O.\n\n2.  **Apply Principles of Electrostatics for Conductors:**\n    *   **Charge Induction:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will cause the mobile charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute. Negative charges will be attracted towards the $+q$ charge and accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   **Gauss's Law:** Consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the bulk of the conducting material and encloses the cavity. A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside its material is zero ($\\vec{E}_{conductor} = 0$). Therefore, the electric flux through our chosen Gaussian surface is zero. According to Gauss's Law ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = Q_{enclosed}/\\epsilon_o$), the total net charge enclosed by this surface must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the charge induced on the inner wall of the cavity, let's call it $q_{inner}$. So, $+q + q_{inner} = 0$, which means $q_{inner} = -q$. A total charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Conservation:** The conductor was initially uncharged (neutral). Since a charge of $-q$ has accumulated on the inner surface, to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else. In a conductor, excess charge resides on its surfaces. Since the $-q$ is on the inner surface, the $+q$ charge must reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):** This is the crucial concept for this problem. A conducting shell isolates the region outside the shell from the charges inside it. The charge distribution on the outer surface of the conductor, and consequently the electric field it produces outside, is independent of the arrangement of charges inside the cavity. The only thing that matters for the outside world is the total charge that gets pushed to the outer surface.\n\n5.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** We have a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface, which is a sphere of radius $R$. Since this conductor is isolated and the outer surface is perfectly spherical, there is no preferred direction. The charges will spread out to minimize repulsion and make the surface an equipotential. Due to symmetry, the only possible stable distribution is a uniform one. So, the charge $+q$ is distributed uniformly over the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:** The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell, at any point outside the shell, is identical to the electric field produced by a single point charge of the same total magnitude, located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer shell is $+q$.\n    *   The center of this spherical shell is O.\n    *   The point of interest, P, is at a distance $L$ from the center O.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q_{outer}}{L^2}$\n    Since $q_{outer} = +q$, we have:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$: This would be the field if the conductor were absent and the charge was at the cavity's center. It ignores the shielding effect.\n    *   B) and C) involve $l$, $s$, and $\\theta$. These parameters describe the position of the cavity and the relation between P and the cavity. As explained by the shielding principle, these details are irrelevant for the field outside the conductor.\n    *   D) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$: This matches our derivation perfectly.\n\nThe problem provides extra information ($l$, $s$, $r$, $\\theta$) to test the understanding of the fundamental principle of electrostatic shielding. The external field of a neutral conductor with an internal charge depends only on the total internal charge and the shape and center of the outer surface.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\n*   **Initial State:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor. This means the net charge on the conductor is zero.\n*   **Placing a Charge:** A positive charge `+q` is placed inside a cavity within the conductor.\n*   **Charge Induction:** Due to electrostatic induction, this `+q` charge will attract negative charges and repel positive charges within the conductor.\n    *   A charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is required by Gauss's Law: if you draw a Gaussian surface entirely within the conducting material (where the electric field must be zero), the net charge enclosed by that surface must be zero. Thus, the charge `+q` inside the cavity must be canceled by an induced charge of `-q` on the cavity wall.\n    *   Since the conductor as a whole was initially neutral, and a charge of `-q` has accumulated on the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere to maintain overall neutrality. This `+q` charge is repelled to the farthest possible location, which is the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n*   **Electrostatic Shielding:** A crucial property of a closed conducting shell is that it acts as an electrostatic shield. The charges inside the conductor (the original `+q` and the induced `-q` on the inner wall) create an electric field. However, the conductor itself rearranges its charges in such a way that the net electric field due to *all* charges (the ones inside the cavity and the ones on the conductor's surfaces) is zero *everywhere inside the conducting material*. A consequence of this shielding is that the distribution of charge on the outer surface is completely independent of the arrangement of charges inside.\n*   **Field Outside the Conductor:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is produced only by the charges on the outer surface of the conductor. The field contribution from the `+q` charge in the cavity and the `-q` charge on the inner surface perfectly cancels out for all points outside the conductor.\n*   **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** We have a charge `+q` induced on the outer surface, which is a sphere of radius R. Since there are no other external charges in the vicinity, this `+q` charge will distribute itself uniformly over the outer spherical surface.\n*   **Calculating the Field at Point P:** For any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is the same as if all the charge on the shell were concentrated into a single point charge at its center.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is at a distance `L` from the point P.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Charge on outer surface}}{(\\text{distance from center})^2}$\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The radius of the cavity (`r`), the location of its center (`s`), the distance of P from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle `\\theta` are all extraneous pieces of information.

A positive charge $+q$ is then placed inside a spherical cavity within the conductor. The conductor itself is isolated.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Induction:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will cause the free charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute themselves.\n    *   To cancel the electric field produced by $+q$ inside the conducting material (a key property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium), a total charge of $-q$ will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   The conductor was initially electrically neutral (charge = 0). Since a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, a charge of $+q$ must be left on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality for the conductor itself.\n\n3.  **Charge Distribution:**\n    *   **Inner Surface:** The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the cavity will not be uniformly distributed. It will be denser on the parts of the wall closer to the location of the charge $+q$.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The charge $+q$ on the outer surface is shielded from the electric field of the charges inside the cavity (+q and the induced -q). This is a fundamental property of conductors known as electrostatic shielding. Because the outer surface is a perfect sphere and it is shielded from the asymmetric configuration inside, the charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The electric field at any external point P is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges in the system:\n    *   The original charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Applying the Shielding Principle:** The combination of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface produces zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity. This is because the conductor rearranges the charge on the inner wall to perfectly cancel the field from the internal charge $+q$ within the bulk of the conductor and thus everywhere outside of it.\n\n6.  **Contribution from the Outer Surface:** Therefore, the only charge distribution that contributes to the electric field at the external point P is the uniform charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n7.  **Applying the Shell Theorem (or Gauss's Law):** According to the shell theorem, for any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer surface = $+q$.\n    *   Center of the outer sphere = Center of the conductor (let's call it O).\n    *   Distance from the center O to the point P = $L$.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** The magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total charge on outer surface}}{(\\text{distance from center})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**Conclusion:** The various other distances and angles provided in the problem (like $r, s, l, \\theta$) are irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the principle of electrostatic shielding. The external field only depends on the total charge that moves to the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state and the change:** We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means its net charge is zero. A positive charge $+q$ is then introduced into the cavity within the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction:** According to the principles of electrostatics, the presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. By applying Gauss's Law to a surface enclosed entirely within the conducting material and surrounding the cavity, the electric field must be zero everywhere on this Gaussian surface. This implies that the net charge enclosed by the surface must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge $+q$ and the total charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity ($q_{inner}$).\n    \n    $q + q_{inner} = 0$\n    $q_{inner} = -q$\n    \n    So, a total charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially uncharged (net charge = 0). The induction of charge $-q$ on the inner surface means that a corresponding positive charge must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain its overall neutrality. This positive charge will move to the outer surface of the conductor. Let the charge on the outer surface be $q_{outer}$.\n    \n    $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = 0$ (since the conductor itself has no net charge)\n    $(-q) + q_{outer} = 0$\n    $q_{outer} = +q$\n    \n    So, a total charge of $+q$ is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding and Charge Distribution:** A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside its bulk material is zero. The charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$ on the inner wall) create a complex electric field. The charges on the outer surface ($+q$) must arrange themselves to completely cancel this field within the conductor's material. Because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere, the only way to ensure the field inside the conductor remains zero and the surface remains an equipotential is for the charge $+q$ to distribute itself *uniformly* over the outer spherical surface. This phenomenon is known as electrostatic shielding; the conductor shields the exterior region from the electrostatic influence of the charges inside the cavity. The non-uniformities of the charge distribution inside are canceled out by the induced charges on the inner cavity wall.\n\n5.  **Calculating the External Electric Field:** Now we need to find the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor. The total electric field at P is the superposition of the fields from all charges: the charge $+q$ in the cavity, the charge $-q$ on the inner surface, and the charge $+q$ on the outer surface. However, due to the shielding effect, the net electric field produced by the charge inside the cavity ($+q$) and the charge on the inner surface ($-q$) is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity. A more direct way to see this is that the field outside is produced solely by the charges on the outer surface.\n\n    We have a uniform distribution of charge $+q$ on the surface of a sphere of radius $R$. According to a result from Gauss's Law (also known as Newton's Shell Theorem for electricity), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a point charge at the center of the sphere.\n\n    *   The charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The distance of point P from the center O is $L$.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q_{outer}}{L^2} = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Options:** The variables related to the cavity's geometry and position ($r$, $s$) and the relative position of point P to the cavity ($l$, $\\theta$) are irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor.

This means it has a large number of free-moving electrons, but the total positive charge from the atomic nuclei is balanced by the total negative charge of the electrons.\n\n2.  **Placing a charge inside the cavity:** A positive charge, `+q`, is introduced into the cavity. This charge will exert an attractive force on the free electrons within the conductor.\n\n3.  **Induction on the inner surface:** In response to the `+q` charge, free electrons from the conductor will be drawn towards the cavity and will accumulate on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). This creates a net negative charge on the inner surface. According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface entirely within the material of the conductor that encloses the cavity, the electric field on this surface must be zero (as it's inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). For the field to be zero, the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, the total charge induced on the inner surface must be exactly `-q` to cancel out the `+q` charge placed inside. The distribution of this `-q` charge on the inner surface will not be uniform; it will be arranged to precisely cancel the electric field produced by `+q` in the region of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Induction on the outer surface:** The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of `-q` (from the free electrons) has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding deficit of electrons is created elsewhere in the conductor. This results in a net positive charge appearing on the conductor. Since these positive charges are free to move on the conductor's surface and they repel each other, they will move as far apart as possible, which means they will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor. The total charge on this outer surface must be `+q` to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor (`-q` on the inner surface + `+q` on the outer surface = 0 net induced charge).\n\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage):** A key principle of electrostatics is that a closed conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of charges inside it. In our case, the conductor acts as a shield. The electric field at any point outside the conductor is produced *only* by the charges on the outer surface. The fields from the original charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface perfectly cancel each other out for all points outside the cavity.\n\n6.  **Distribution of charge on the outer surface:** The charge `+q` is on the outer surface of the spherical conductor. Because this surface is a sphere and is shielded from the non-symmetrical arrangement of charges within the cavity, and there are no other external electric fields, the `+q` charge will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n\n7.  **Calculating the external electric field:** The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell at a point outside the shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude placed at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer surface = `+q`.\n    *   The center of the outer sphere is the center of the conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is `L`.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by the formula for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The other parameters given in the problem, such as the radius of the cavity `r`, the distance of the cavity's center from the conductor's center `s`, the distance `l`, and the angle `\\theta`, are irrelevant for determining the electric field *outside* the conductor.

Let's break down the situation step-by-step to find the electric field at point P.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have a spherical conductor that is initially uncharged. It has a spherical cavity within it. A positive point charge, `+q`, is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field `E` at a point `P` located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction:** The presence of the positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile electrons within the conductor to redistribute.\n    *   To shield the interior of the conductor from the electric field of `+q`, negative charges will be attracted to the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). By applying Gauss's Law to a surface just inside the conducting material enclosing the cavity, the electric field must be zero. This implies that the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, a total charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   The conductor was initially electrically neutral (uncharged). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding positive charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor. This charge `+q` will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electric Field at an External Point P:** The total electric field at point P is the vector sum of the fields produced by three sets of charges:\n    *   The original charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface (cavity wall).\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A crucial principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the fields of any charges located inside it. The combined electric field produced by the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity. This is because the `-q` charge arranges itself precisely to cancel the field of `+q` for all points within the conductor and beyond.\n\n5.  **Field from the Outer Surface:** Because of this shielding effect, the electric field at point P (outside the conductor) is produced *only* by the charge distributed on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** We have determined that the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. Since this outer surface is a sphere and is not under the influence of any other *external* charges (and is shielded from the internal ones), the charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface to be in electrostatic equilibrium. The specific location of the charge `+q` inside the cavity does not affect the distribution of charge on the outer surface.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell at any point outside the shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge equal to the total charge on the shell, located at the center of the shell.\n    *   The total charge on the outer shell is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is at O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center O.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   The information given about the cavity's radius `r`, its center's offset `s`, the distance `l` from the cavity's center to P, and the angle `θ` is all extraneous detail designed to distract from the core physics principles.

This matches our derivation.\n        *   D) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect. This would be the field if the source were at the center of the cavity, which is not the case due to the conductor.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe electric field outside the conductor is solely determined by the uniformly distributed charge `+q` on its outer surface. This setup is equivalent to a point charge `+q` located at the center of the spherical conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to the point P is `L`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have an electrically neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor of radius $R$. Inside this conductor, there is a small spherical cavity. A point charge of $+q$ is placed somewhere within this cavity. We need to find the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** The positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. To determine the total amount of this induced charge, we can apply Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity.\n    *   A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field ($\\vec{E}$) inside the conductor's material is zero.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the net charge enclosed ($Q_{enc}$) divided by the permittivity of free space ($\\epsilon_o$).  $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_o}$.\n    *   Since $\\vec{E} = 0$ everywhere on our Gaussian surface within the conductor, the flux is zero. This implies that the net charge enclosed by the surface must also be zero ($Q_{enc} = 0$).\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge $+q$ and the total charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity, let's call it $q_{inner}$.\n    *   So, $Q_{enc} = q + q_{inner} = 0$.\n    *   This leads to $q_{inner} = -q$. A total charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This charge will not be distributed uniformly, as its distribution depends on the exact position of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged, meaning its net charge was zero. Since it is an isolated conductor, its total net charge must remain zero.\n    *   The total charge of the conductor is the sum of the charge on its inner surface and the charge on its outer surface ($q_{outer}$).\n    *   Total charge = $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = 0$.\n    *   Substituting the value of $q_{inner}$, we get $-q + q_{outer} = 0$.\n    *   This implies $q_{outer} = +q$. A total charge of $+q$ is induced on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields the region outside the shell from the electrostatic effects of charges located inside the shell.\n    *   The electric field at point P outside the conductor is the vector sum of the fields created by all charges: the point charge $+q$, the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface, and the induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface.\n    *   Due to the shielding effect of the conductor, the combined electric field produced by the point charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is solely due to the charge $+q$ residing on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n5.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The outer surface of the conductor is a sphere of radius $R$. The charge $+q$ on this surface will distribute itself to make the surface an equipotential. In the absence of any other external electric fields, the only way to achieve this for a spherical surface is for the charge to distribute itself uniformly. The complex arrangement of charges inside the cavity does not affect the distribution on the outer surface because of the shielding.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** Now the problem is reduced to finding the electric field at point P due to a uniformly distributed charge of $+q$ on a spherical shell of radius $R$.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (a result that can also be derived from Gauss's Law), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if the entire charge of the shell were concentrated as a point charge at its center.\n    *   The total charge on the outer shell is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the shell is the center of the spherical conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to the point P is given as $L$.\n    *   Using Coulomb's Law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at P is:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The radius of the cavity ($r$), the distance of its center from the conductor's center ($s$), the distance of P from the cavity's center ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are distractor variables. The field outside only depends on the net charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have a neutral spherical conductor with an off-center spherical cavity. A positive point charge, $+q$, is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the entire conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will cause the mobile electrons within the conductor to redistribute.\n    *   Electrons will be attracted towards the $+q$ charge, accumulating on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). To find the total charge induced on this inner surface, we can apply Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity.\n    *   In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the bulk of a conductor must be zero. Therefore, the electric flux through our chosen Gaussian surface is zero.\n    *   Gauss's Law ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$) tells us that the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must also be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge $(+q)$ and the induced charge on the inner cavity wall $(q_{inner})$.\n    *   So, $q + q_{inner} = 0$, which means $q_{inner} = -q$. A charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of $-q$ has accumulated on the inner surface, to maintain overall neutrality of the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else on the conductor. As charges can only reside on surfaces in electrostatics, this $+q$ charge will spread out on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):** A crucial principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of charges located inside it. The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is determined *only* by the charge distribution on the outer surface of the conductor. The configuration inside the cavity (the exact position of the charge $+q$, the off-center location of the cavity, and the resulting non-uniform distribution of the $-q$ charge on the cavity wall) has no effect on the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n5.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** We have a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor. Since this outer surface is a perfect sphere (radius R) and there are no other external charges in the problem, this $+q$ charge will distribute itself **uniformly** over the outer surface due to symmetry.\n\n6.  **Calculating the External Electric Field:** According to the shell theorem (which is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law for spherical symmetry), the electric field at an external point due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a single point charge of the same total magnitude, located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the outer spherical surface is the center of the conductor, let's call it O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from this center O.\n\n7.  **Final Formula:** Using Coulomb's Law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{(\\text{distance from center})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   The other pieces of information given in the problem (the cavity radius $r$, the distance $s$ between the centers, the distance $l$ of P from the cavity's center, and the angle $\\theta$) are irrelevant for finding the field *outside* the conductor.

It has a cavity inside.\n\n2.  **Placing the charge:** A positive point charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Induction on the inner surface:** The presence of the positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges from the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, to make the electric field inside the conducting material zero, the total charge induced on the inner surface must be equal and opposite to the charge enclosed.\n    *   Let's consider a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity.\n    *   The electric field $\\vec{E}$ must be zero everywhere on this Gaussian surface because it is inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium.\n    *   Gauss's Law states: $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$.\n    *   Since $\\vec{E} = 0$, the integral is zero, which implies that the total charge enclosed, $Q_{enclosed}$, must be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge `+q` and the charge induced on the inner cavity surface, $q_{inner}$.\n    *   $Q_{enclosed} = +q + q_{inner} = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the charge induced on the inner surface is $q_{inner} = -q$.\n\n4.  **Induction on the outer surface:** The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding positive charge must appear elsewhere to maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor. This excess positive charge will move to the outermost surface of the conductor to maximize its separation.\n    *   Total charge of the conductor = $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = 0$ (since it was initially uncharged).\n    *   $-q + q_{outer} = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the charge induced on the outer surface is $q_{outer} = +q$.\n\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of a closed conducting shell (like our spherical conductor) is that it shields its exterior from the electric field of any charges placed inside it. The electric field at any point outside the conductor is determined *only* by the charge distribution on the *outer surface* of the conductor. The original charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface combine to produce zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity, which includes point P.\n\n6.  **Charge distribution on the outer surface:** We have a total charge of `+q` on the outer surface of the spherical conductor. Since there are no other external charges or fields, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface. This happens because the shielding effect prevents the internal charges from influencing the outer charge distribution.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** Now, the problem is simplified to finding the electric field from a uniformly charged spherical shell with total charge `+q` and radius `R`. According to the Shell Theorem (a direct result of Gauss's Law), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at a point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer shell = `+q`.\n    *   Center of the shell = O.\n    *   Point of interest = P.\n    *   Distance from the center O to the point P = `L`.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** The magnitude of the electric field at P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{(\\text{Distance from center})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nNotice that the details about the cavity's location (`s`), its radius (`r`), the distance from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle (`\\theta`) are all irrelevant to the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the principle of electrostatic shielding.

Inside this conductor, there is a spherical cavity that is not at the center of the conductor. A positive point charge, `+q`, is placed at some location within this cavity.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface (Cavity Wall):** The positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract the free electrons within the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the surface of the cavity. To completely cancel the electric field from the charge `+q` inside the bulk of the conductor (a key property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium), the total charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity must be `-q`. This can be proven by applying Gauss's Law to a surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity. Since the electric field `E` is zero everywhere on this Gaussian surface, the total charge enclosed must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge (`+q`) and the charge on the cavity wall (`q_inner`). Therefore, `+q + q_inner = 0`, which implies `q_inner = -q`.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` (electrons) has moved to the inner surface, a net positive charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality. As the electric field inside a conductor must be zero, these excess positive charges will repel each other and move to the outermost surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Distribution of the Outer Charge:** The charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly. This is a crucial point. The conductor has a property called electrostatic shielding. The arrangement of the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall ensures that their combined electric field is zero everywhere outside the cavity. Therefore, the charges on the outer surface are only influenced by the spherical shape of the outer conductor itself. For a spherical conductor, the charge distributes uniformly over its surface to reach electrostatic equilibrium.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges:\n    *   The field from the point charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The field from the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall.\n    *   The field from the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Applying the Shielding Principle:** As established in step 4, the combined electric field from the charge `+q` within the cavity and the charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero for all points outside the cavity. This includes the point P.\n\n7.  **Simplifying the Problem:** Therefore, the electric field at point P is solely determined by the charge `+q` that is uniformly distributed on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n8.  **Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** A well-known result from Gauss's law is that the electric field at an external point (at a distance `L` from the center) due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field of a point charge of the same total magnitude placed at the center of the sphere.\n\n9.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge creating the external field is `+q`.\n    *   This charge can be treated as a point charge located at the center of the large spherical conductor (let's call it O).\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is given as `L`.\n    *   The magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's Law:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n10. **Conclusion:** The information about the cavity's radius `r`, its offset `s`, the distance `l`, and the angle `\\theta` are all extraneous details.

A positive charge `+q` is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Induction of Charges:** The presence of the positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile electrons in the conductor to redistribute themselves.\n    *   Electrons will be attracted towards the `+q` charge, accumulating on the inner surface of the cavity. To completely cancel the electric field from the `+q` charge *within the conductor material*, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law applied to a Gaussian surface drawn entirely within the conducting material and enclosing the cavity. Since the electric field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero, the net enclosed charge must be zero.\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has accumulated on the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality. This `+q` charge will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is that they provide electrostatic shielding. The cavity and its contents (the original `+q` charge and the induced `-q` on the inner wall) are completely shielded from the outside region by the conducting material. This means the arrangement of charges inside the cavity has no effect on the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The charge `+q` that appears on the outer surface will distribute itself in a way that minimizes repulsion. Since the conductor is spherical and isolated from any other external fields (the internal field is shielded), the `+q` charge will spread out uniformly over the outer spherical surface.\n\n5.  **Calculating the External Electric Field:** Now, we need to find the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor. The field at P is the superposition of the fields from all charges. However, due to shielding, the net effect of the charges inside the cavity (the original `+q` and the induced `-q`) on the field outside is zero. Therefore, the only charge that contributes to the electric field at point P is the `+q` charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** According to a well-known result from electrostatics (derivable from Gauss's Law), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a single point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of this charge distribution is the center of the spherical conductor.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is the same as that of a point charge `+q` at a distance `L`:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The distances `l` and `s`, and the angle `theta`, which describe the specific location of the charge within the cavity and the location of point P relative to the cavity, are irrelevant for determining the electric field outside the conductor. The correct expression only depends on the total charge `q` and the distance `L` from the center of the conductor.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have a spherical conductor that is initially uncharged.

We need to find the electric field `E` at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply Principles of Electrostatics for Conductors:**\n    *   **Electric Field Inside a Conductor:** In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the bulk material of a conductor must be zero.\n    *   **Gauss's Law:** The net electric flux through any closed surface (a Gaussian surface) is proportional to the total electric charge enclosed by that surface ($\\Phi_E = \\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$).\n    *   **Induced Charges:** The presence of the charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute themselves.\n\n3.  **Charge Distribution - Inner Surface:**\n    *   Consider a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity.\n    *   Since the electric field `E` must be zero everywhere on this Gaussian surface (as it's inside the conductor), the total electric flux through this surface is zero.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, this means the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge `+q` placed inside the cavity and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity (`q_inner`).\n    *   Therefore, `+q + q_inner = 0`, which implies `q_inner = -q`.\n    *   So, a total charge of `-q` is induced on the wall of the cavity. This induced charge `-q` will distribute itself non-uniformly on the inner surface to perfectly cancel the electric field produced by the point charge `+q` for all points outside the cavity (i.e., within the conductor and beyond).\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution - Outer Surface:**\n    *   The conductor was initially electrically neutral.\n    *   Since a charge of `-q` was induced on the inner surface (by drawing electrons from the conductor), a net charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain overall neutrality.\n    *   This excess charge of `+q` will reside on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   Crucially, the charges on the outer surface are shielded from the electric field of the charges inside the cavity (`+q` and the induced `-q`).

Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity. In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field `E` inside the conducting material must be zero. Therefore, the electric flux through this Gaussian surface is zero. By Gauss's Law (`Φ = Q_enclosed / ε_o`), the total charge enclosed (`Q_enclosed`) must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge `+q` placed in the cavity and the charge induced on the inner wall (`q_inner`). So, `+q + q_inner = 0`, which means `q_inner = -q`.\n\n3.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The problem states that the spherical conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, to conserve the total charge of the conductor, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor. The total charge of the conductor remains `-q + q = 0` (ignoring the `+q` that was added to the cavity). The system (conductor + cavity charge) has a net charge of `+q`.\n\n4.  **Distribution of the Outer Charge and Shielding:** The conducting material acts as an electrostatic shield. This means the charge distribution on the outer surface is completely unaffected by the arrangement of charges inside the cavity (the location of `+q` or the induced `-q`). The charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself as if the inner charges weren't there. Since the outer surface is a sphere and there are no other external fields mentioned, the charge `+q` will spread out *uniformly* over the outer spherical surface.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** A fundamental result from electrostatics (derivable from Gauss's Law, and also known as the Shell Theorem) is that for any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field produced by the shell is identical to the electric field of a single point charge with the same total charge, located at the center of the sphere.\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The outer surface is a sphere, and we can consider its center to be the center of the conductor.\n    *   Point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the conductor.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is the same as that of a point charge `+q` located at the center of the conductor.\n\n    The magnitude of the electric field `E` from a point charge is given by Coulomb's Law:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{(\\text{distance})^2}$\n\n    Substituting our values:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The parameters `r` (cavity radius), `s` (cavity offset), `l` (distance from cavity center to P), and `θ` are irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are provided as distractors. The external field only depends on the total charge `+q` and the distance `L` from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
