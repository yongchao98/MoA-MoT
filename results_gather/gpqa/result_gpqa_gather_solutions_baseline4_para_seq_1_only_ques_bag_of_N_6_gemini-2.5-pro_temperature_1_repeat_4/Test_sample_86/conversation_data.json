Deconstruct the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring with two groups attached (C6H4XY).\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents (X and Y) must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Data:**\n    *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present.\n\n**2. Deduce the Possible Chemical Structure**\n\n*   From the FTIR data, we know one substituent (let's say X) is a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, or -I). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent (Y) must contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible C2 substituents containing a carbonyl group:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This has 2 carbons and a C=O. If this group is attached to the halo-benzene ring, the structure would be **halo-acetophenone** (C6H4(X)(COCH3)). This structure fits all the criteria: 8 carbons (6+2), di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n    *   **Formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO):** This also has 2 carbons and a C=O. The structure would be **halo-phenylacetaldehyde** (C6H4(X)(CH2CHO)). This structure also fits all the criteria.\n    *   Other groups like carboxymethyl (-CH2COOH) or methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH3) would also fit the carbon count and functional group requirement, but we will see that their expected NMR spectra do not match any of the options.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Options**\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to match the predicted 1H NMR spectrum of our candidate structures with the given options. A di-substituted benzene ring will have 4 aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Option A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows no signals in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). It cannot be the correct answer.\n\n*   **Option C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows only one aromatic proton (1H, s), which would suggest a tetra-substituted ring, contradicting the \"di-substituted\" information. It cannot be the correct answer.\n\n*   **Option B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, is highly characteristic of a **para (1,4)-substituted** benzene ring. The chemical shifts, being far downfield (>7.5 ppm), indicate that both substituents are electron-withdrawing.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** `2.3 (3H, s)`. A singlet integrating to 3 protons in this region (~2.1-2.6 ppm) is the classic signal for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (**-COCH3**).\n    *   **Matching Structure:** This spectrum perfectly matches the description of **p-halo-acetophenone**. The acetyl group (-COCH3) and the halogen (-X) are both electron-withdrawing and are in a para arrangement. The total proton count is 4 (aromatic) + 3 (methyl) = 7H, which matches the integration (2H + 2H + 3H = 7H).\n\n*   **Option D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Characteristic Peaks:** The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is unmistakably an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO). The signal at `3.7 (2H, s)` is consistent with a methylene group adjacent to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl (-Ar-**CH2**-CHO).\n    *   **Matching Structure:** This data points towards the **p-halo-phenylacetaldehyde** structure.\n    *   **Inconsistency:** However, there is a major problem. The aromatic signals are at `7.8` and `7.6` ppm. For a phenylacetaldehyde, the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group is insulated from the ring by a CH2 group. Its effect on the ring is minimal. The aromatic protons should therefore appear much closer to the region for a simple halobenzene, around 7.2-7.4 ppm. The downfield shifts of 7.6-7.8 ppm are inconsistent with this structure. Such strong deshielding requires direct conjugation of the ring with an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl, as seen in acetophenone.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\n*   Option B describes the NMR spectrum of p-halo-acetophenone. All features of the spectrum (aromatic pattern, aromatic shifts, aliphatic signal) are consistent with this structure.\n*   Option D contains an internal contradiction: the aliphatic signals point to a phenylacetaldehyde structure, but the aromatic signals are in a region that is chemically incorrect for that structure.\n*   Therefore, the compound is a halo-acetophenone, and the correct 1H NMR data is given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis question asks to identify the correct ¹H NMR data for a specific chemical compound. Let's break down the information given to deduce the structure of the compound and predict its NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula and Basic Structure:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means we start with a benzene ring (C₆H₆) and replace two hydrogen atoms with two substituent groups. The core is C₆H₄.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms is 8. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The FTIR data confirms the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X, where X is a halogen like Cl, Br, or I).\n\n2.  **Determine the Substituents and Isomers:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X), which contains no carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both the carbonyl group and the two carbon atoms. The most common and stable chemical group fitting this description is an **acetyl group** (-COCH₃).\n    *   So, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n    *   Since it is di-substituted, the halogen and the acetyl group can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: *ortho* (1,2-), *meta* (1,3-), or *para* (1,4-).\n\n3.  **Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Isomer:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (on the C₆H₄ ring):** There are 4 protons on the ring.\n        *   For *ortho* and *meta* isomers, the molecule is unsymmetrical. This would result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, likely appearing as complex multiplets.\n        *   For the ***para* (1,4-) isomer**, the molecule is symmetrical. There are only two distinct types of aromatic protons. The two protons next to the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons next to the halogen are equivalent. This symmetry results in a very characteristic pattern: **two doublets**, each integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Substituent Protons (on the -COCH₃ group):**\n        *   The acetyl group has a methyl group (-CH₃). These three protons are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they will appear as a **singlet** integrating to **3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone) is typically around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given NMR Data Options:**\n\n    *   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** It shows two doublets at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, each for 2 hydrogens. This is the classic signature of a **para-substituted** aromatic ring. The downfield chemical shifts (>7.5 ppm) are consistent with protons on a ring attached to two electron-withdrawing groups (both halogens and the acetyl group are deactivating/electron-withdrawing).\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** It shows a singlet at 2.3 ppm for 3 hydrogens. This perfectly matches the signal for an acetyl methyl group.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This data is a perfect match for a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    *   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not a ketone. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The integration in the aromatic region is incorrect. A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons, not 5 (1H + 2H + 2H). This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   There are no signals in the typical aromatic proton region (usually 6.5-8.5 ppm). This contradicts the fact that the compound has an aromatic ring. This option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that correctly describes the ¹H NMR spectrum for the compound deduced from the problem statement (a para-haloacetophenone).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Information from the Question:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituent groups attached.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One of the substituents is a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, or -I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote this as -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen, -X. This substituent contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   Let's consider possible C2 groups that contain a carbonyl (C=O):\n        *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3)**: This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. This is a very common substituent.\n        *   **Formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO)**: This also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group (in an aldehyde).\n        *   Other possibilities like a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or a carboxylic acid group (-CH2COOH) also fit the carbon count and carbonyl requirement.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data in the Options:**\n    *   Let's look for patterns. Options B and D both show a similar pattern in the aromatic region: `~7.8 (2H, d)` and `~7.6 (2H, d)`. This means there are two signals, each representing two equivalent protons, and each is a doublet. This is a classic, textbook pattern for a **para- (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two on the other.\n    *   Options A and C do not show signals in the typical aromatic proton chemical shift range (6.5-8.5 ppm), or the patterns do not match a disubstituted benzene ring. They can be eliminated.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Remaining Options (B and D) with Plausible Structures:**\n\n    *   **Candidate Structure 1: p-Haloacetophenone.**\n        *   This structure consists of a benzene ring with a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3) in a para arrangement.\n        *   It fits all initial criteria: di-substituted aromatic ring, 8 total carbons (6+2), carbonyl group, and aromatic-halogen bond.\n        *   **Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n            *   **Aromatic Protons:** Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, due to the para substitution. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group will be further downfield. This matches the `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` pattern.\n            *   **Aliphatic Protons:** A methyl group (-CH3) is attached to a carbonyl. It has no adjacent protons, so it will appear as a **singlet (s)**. It will integrate to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n        *   **Compare with Option D:** `1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`. This is a **perfect match** for the predicted spectrum of p-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **Candidate Structure 2: (p-Halophenyl)acetaldehyde.**\n        *   This structure has a halogen (-X) and a formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO) in a para arrangement.\n        *   It also fits all initial criteria.\n        *   **Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n            *   **Aromatic Protons:** Two doublets, each for 2H. This matches the `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` pattern.\n            *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** A very downfield signal, typically 9-10 ppm. It is adjacent to the -CH2- group, so it should be split into a **triplet (t)**. It would integrate to **1H**.\n            *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-):** A signal deshielded by the ring and the carbonyl, typically ~3.5-4.0 ppm. It is adjacent to the -CHO proton, so it should be split into a **doublet (d)**. It would integrate to **2H**.\n        *   **Compare with Option B:** `1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`. The chemical shifts are plausible for this structure. However, the splitting pattern is incorrect. Both the aldehyde and methylene protons are listed as **singlets (s)**, not the expected triplet and doublet. While small coupling constants can sometimes appear as singlets, this is less likely and makes the data a poorer fit than option D.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The 1H NMR data in option D is a textbook, unambiguous match for p-haloacetophenone, a structure that perfectly satisfies all the conditions given in the problem statement. The data in option B, while corresponding to another plausible structure, has a questionable splitting pattern. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Compound's Description:**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n*   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR - Carbonyl group:** The compound contains a C=O group.\n*   **FTIR - Aromatic-halogen bond:** A halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Propose Candidate Structures:**\n\nBased on the information above, one substituent is a halogen (-X). The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. Let's consider the possibilities for this second substituent:\n\n*   **An acetyl group:** -C(=O)CH3. This has two carbons and a carbonyl group. The resulting compound would be a **haloacetophenone**. The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (substituent) = 8. This is a strong candidate.\n*   **A formyl-methyl group:** -CH2CHO. This also has two carbons and a carbonyl group. The resulting compound would be a **(halophenyl)acetaldehyde**. The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (substituent) = 8. This is another strong candidate.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n\nLet's examine the provided NMR data to see which structure it supports. The options that show signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) are A and C. Options B and D can be quickly eliminated.\n\n*   **Option B:** Has no signals in the aromatic region. This contradicts the presence of an aromatic ring.\n*   **Option D:** Shows only one aromatic proton (1H, s). A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons. This is incorrect.\n\nNow, let's analyze the plausible options, A and C. Both show a pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H (`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`). This is a classic signature for **para (1,4) substitution** on a benzene ring, where the two substituents are different enough electronically to create an AA'BB' system that appears as two distinct doublets.\n\nSo, we are comparing **4-haloacetophenone** and **4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**4. Evaluate Option A vs. Option C:**\n\n*   **Option A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Structure Match:** This spectrum corresponds to **4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde**.\n        *   `9.9 (1H, s)`: This is the characteristic chemical shift for an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO).\n        *   `3.7 (2H, s)`: This is a typical shift for a **methylene group** (-CH2-) adjacent to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Aromatic protons.\n    *   **Consistency Check:** The group attached to the ring is -CH2CHO. The electron-withdrawing carbonyl group is insulated from the ring by a CH2 group. Therefore, the -CH2CHO group is only weakly deactivating. It would not shift the aromatic protons so far downfield to 7.6-7.8 ppm. The expected shifts would be much closer to those of toluene or ethylbenzene (around 7.1-7.3 ppm). For example, the protons of 4-chlorophenylacetaldehyde appear around 7.3 and 7.2 ppm. The aromatic shifts in this option are inconsistent with the proposed structure.\n\n*   **Option C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Structure Match:** This spectrum corresponds to **4-haloacetophenone**.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is in the region for a **methyl group** (-CH3). The singlet multiplicity indicates it's next to a quaternary carbon, like the carbonyl carbon in an acetyl group.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Aromatic protons.\n    *   **Consistency Check:** The group attached to the ring is an acetyl group, -C(=O)CH3. The carbonyl is directly attached to the ring and is a strong electron-withdrawing group. This deshields the aromatic protons, especially those ortho to the acetyl group, pushing their chemical shifts significantly downfield. Shifts of 7.6-7.8 ppm are very characteristic for this type of structure. For example, 4-bromoacetophenone shows peaks at 7.82 and 7.61 ppm. The aromatic data is a very good fit. The methyl group shift at 2.3 ppm is slightly more upfield than the typical ~2.6 ppm for acetophenones, but this is a much smaller and more plausible discrepancy than the large error in the aromatic shifts in Option A.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemical shifts of aromatic protons are a strong indicator of the electronic nature of the substituents. The downfield shifts of 7.8 and 7.6 ppm strongly support the presence of a powerful, directly attached electron-withdrawing group like the acetyl group in 4-haloacetophenone. The data in Option A is inconsistent with the electronic effects of a -CH2CHO group. Therefore, Option C is the best match for the described compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n*   **Core Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** 8. Since the benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbons (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X), meaning a halogen (like F, Cl, Br, I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Molecular Structure:**\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible structures for a two-carbon substituent containing a C=O group:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This fits perfectly. It has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The resulting molecule would be a halo-acetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n    *   **Phenylacetaldehyde derivative (-CH2CHO):** This also fits. The substituent -CH2CHO has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The resulting molecule would be a halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n*   Both `X-C6H4-COCH3` and `X-C6H4-CH2CHO` are valid structures based on the initial description. Both have 8 carbons, a di-substituted ring, a carbonyl, and an aromatic-halogen bond. The molecular formula for both would be C8H7XO, meaning they have 7 protons.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectra for the Possible Structures:**\nThe options present spectra with two doublets in the aromatic region, which is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) substitution pattern**. So we will assume para-substitution for our analysis.\n\n*   **Case 1: para-halo-acetophenone (p-X-C6H4-COCH3)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** The benzene ring has two types of protons. The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be strongly deshielded. The two protons ortho to the halogen will also be deshielded, but typically less so. We expect two doublets in the region of **~7.4-8.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH3) is attached to a carbonyl. This deshields the protons. We expect a singlet (no adjacent protons) around **~2.3-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Total Protons:** 4H (aromatic) + 3H (methyl) = 7H.\n\n*   **Case 2: para-halo-phenylacetaldehyde (p-X-C6H4-CH2CHO)**\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (1H):** The aldehyde proton (-CHO) is highly deshielded. We expect a singlet around **~9.5-10.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** The -CH2CHO group is less electron-withdrawing than a directly attached carbonyl. The aromatic protons would be less deshielded than in Case 1. We expect two doublets in the region of **~7.1-7.4 ppm**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (2H):** The benzylic methylene protons (-CH2-) are deshielded by both the ring and the adjacent carbonyl. We expect a singlet around **~3.6-3.8 ppm**.\n    *   **Total Protons:** 1H (aldehyde) + 4H (aromatic) + 2H (methylene) = 7H.\n\n**4. Analyze the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect. It lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (7-8 ppm).\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum appears to describe the phenylacetaldehyde structure (Case 2), with the aldehyde (9.9 ppm) and methylene (3.7 ppm) protons matching well. However, the aromatic shifts (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) are too high (too deshielded). They are characteristic of a ketone directly attached to the ring (Case 1), not a phenylacetaldehyde. This option contains an internal inconsistency.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum is a perfect match for our prediction for para-halo-acetophenone (Case 1).\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, consistent with a para-substituted ring bearing a strong electron-withdrawing group. Total integration is 4H.\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** A singlet in the correct region for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. Integration is 3H.\n    *   Total integration is 7H. This is a chemically consistent and accurate spectrum for the structure.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect. A di-substituted benzene ring should have 4 aromatic protons, not 1. The integrations are also inconsistent with any likely structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe NMR data in option C perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for a para-halo-acetophenone, which is a valid structure derived from the problem description. The data in option B, while appearing plausible at first glance, contains chemically inconsistent chemical shifts for the aromatic protons. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Compound Information:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This means we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached to it.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum... presence of a carbonyl group (C=O)\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O functional group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum... presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have a halogen (-X) as one substituent.\n    *   The second substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   Two plausible structures for this second substituent are:\n        *   An acetyl group: -C(=O)CH3. This is a ketone.\n        *   A formylmethyl group: -CH2CHO. This is an aldehyde.\n    *   This gives us two possible candidate molecules:\n        *   **Candidate 1**: A haloacetophenone (Structure: X-C6H4-COCH3). This has 8 carbons, a carbonyl, a halogen on the ring, and is di-substituted.\n        *   **Candidate 2**: A (halophenyl)acetaldehyde (Structure: X-C6H4-CH2CHO). This also has 8 carbons, a carbonyl, a halogen on the ring, and is di-substituted.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum is highly unlikely. A di-substituted benzene ring typically has 4 aromatic protons, and the splitting patterns and integrations here do not match. Ruled out.\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum has no signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). Since the compound is aromatic, this option is incorrect. Ruled out.\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** The two doublets at 7.8 ppm (2H) and 7.6 ppm (2H) are characteristic of a para (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring, indicating a high degree of symmetry.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** The singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H is a classic signal for a methyl group (-CH3) next to a carbonyl (an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n        *   **Overall Fit:** This spectrum perfectly matches the structure of a **para-haloacetophenone**. The electron-withdrawing carbonyl group deshields the aromatic protons, pushing their chemical shifts downfield (to higher ppm values like 7.6-7.8 ppm). The chemical shifts are all consistent with this structure.\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** Like option B, this shows a para-disubstituted pattern.\n        *   **Functional Group/Aliphatic Region:** The singlet at 9.9 ppm (1H) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The singlet at 3.7 ppm (2H) is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the ring (a benzylic position).\n        *   **Overall Fit:** This spectrum suggests the structure of **para-(halophenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n        *   **Inconsistency Check:** Let's check the chemical plausibility. An aldehyde group attached via a methylene (-CH2CHO) is an electron-withdrawing group, but its effect on the ring is insulated by the CH2 spacer. It is significantly less deactivating than a directly attached carbonyl group (-COCH3). Therefore, it would not shift the aromatic protons as far downfield as 7.6-7.8 ppm. The expected chemical shifts for the aromatic protons in this compound would be closer to 7.1-7.4 ppm. The shifts provided (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) are inconsistent with the proposed -CH2CHO substituent.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Option B presents a 1H NMR spectrum that is fully consistent with a plausible structure (para-haloacetophenone) that fits all the criteria given in the problem. Option D describes a spectrum with an internal inconsistency between the aromatic chemical shifts and the proposed substituent. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the problem statement to determine the compound's structure.**\n    1.  **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring with two substituents attached. The base formula for the ring part is C6H4.\n    2.  **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    3.  **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n    4.  **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly bonded to one of the carbons of the benzene ring. Let's denote this substituent as -X.\n\n*   **Step 2: Combine the structural clues to identify the molecule.**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The most common and stable functional group that fits the description \"-C2 and C=O\" is an acetyl group, -C(=O)CH3.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The two substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the possible isomers and their expected 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   The two substituents can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n    *   **Ortho and Meta Isomers**: These isomers are asymmetrical. They would have four unique protons on the aromatic ring, each giving a separate signal (integrating to 1H each) with complex splitting patterns (e.g., doublet of doublets, triplets).\n    *   **Para Isomer (1,4-disubstitution)**: This isomer is symmetrical. Due to the plane of symmetry, there are only two types of protons on the aromatic ring.\n        *   The two protons ortho to the acetyl group are chemically equivalent.\n        *   The two protons ortho to the halogen group are chemically equivalent.\n        *   This results in a characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons (2H).\n        *   The acetyl group (-COCH3) contains three equivalent methyl protons. Since there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon, this signal will be a singlet, integrating to 3 protons (3H).\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the given 1H NMR data options against the expected spectrum for the para-isomer.**\n    *   The expected spectrum for a para-haloacetophenone is:\n        *   Aromatic region (~7.0-8.5 ppm): A doublet for 2H and another doublet for 2H.\n        *   Aliphatic region (~2.0-3.0 ppm): A singlet for 3H.\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a ketone. This would imply a different molecule, one which violates the \"aromatic-halogen bond\" condition (e.g., 4-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde). So, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts at 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are not in the typical range for aromatic protons. So, B is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d)**: This perfectly matches the expected pattern for a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The chemical shifts are appropriate, with the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group appearing further downfield (7.8 ppm).\n        *   **2.3 (3H, s)**: This is a singlet for 3 protons, with a chemical shift typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (an acetyl group).\n        *   This data set is a perfect match for a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   Similar to B, the chemical shifts are not correct for this type of aromatic compound. So, D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion**: The only NMR data that correctly describes a di-substituted 8-carbon aromatic compound with a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond is C, which corresponds to a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n*   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O)\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\nNow, let's assemble the pieces:\n*   We have a halogen substituent (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The only stable and common functional group that fits this description is an **acetyl group** (-COCH3).\n\nSo, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3. This structure has 6 carbons in the ring, 1 carbon in the carbonyl group, and 1 carbon in the methyl group, for a total of 8 carbons. This is consistent with all the information provided.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the Deduced Structure**\n\nA haloacetophenone molecule (X-C6H4-COCH3) has two types of protons that will give signals in the 1H NMR spectrum:\n*   **Methyl Protons (-CH3)**: The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The chemical shift of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone) is typically in the range of 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (-C6H4-)**: There are 4 protons on the benzene ring. Their chemical shift and splitting pattern depend on the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Data in the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on our prediction:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches our prediction for the acetyl methyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: These are two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons. This pattern is characteristic of a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring, where the symmetry results in two sets of equivalent protons. The total number of aromatic protons is 2H + 2H = 4H, which is correct.\n    *   This option is a strong candidate for para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   `9.9 (1H, s)`: A signal around 9-10 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO), not a ketone. Our deduced structure is a ketone. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The shifts at 4.6-4.8 ppm are too low for standard aromatic protons. Also, the `1.3 (2H, s)` signal does not match the 3H singlet of a methyl group. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   Similar to option C, this spectrum lacks the characteristic aromatic proton signals. The chemical shift of the 3H singlet at 1.3 ppm is too low for a methyl ketone. This option is incorrect.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nOnly option A provides a 1H NMR spectrum that is consistent with the deduced structure of a haloacetophenone. The pattern specifically points to a **para-substituted** isomer (e.g., 4'-chloroacetophenone or 4'-bromoacetophenone).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula Information:** The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Structural Information:** It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6) with two groups attached to it.\n    *   **FTIR Spectroscopy Information:**\n        *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n        *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This tells us one of the substituents on the benzene ring is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I).\n\n2.  **Determine the structure of the substituents:**\n    *   The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   The total number of carbons is 8. Therefore, the substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n    *   This means the other substituent must contain both of the 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The most common and stable C2-substituent containing a carbonyl group is the acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Let's check if this fits: An acetyl group has 2 carbons and one C=O. This is a perfect fit.\n\n3.  **Assemble the molecular structure:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   The compound is a haloacetophenone: X-C6H4-COCH3.\n    *   There are three possible positional isomers: ortho, meta, and para.\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the most likely isomer:**\n    *   The 1H NMR options provided show simple splitting patterns (doublets), which are characteristic of a highly symmetric substitution pattern on the benzene ring. The para- (1,4-) substitution pattern is the most symmetric.\n    *   Let's predict the spectrum for **para-haloacetophenone (p-X-C6H4-COCH3)**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** In a para-disubstituted ring, due to symmetry, there are only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons. This typically results in a pattern known as an AA'BB' system, which often appears as two distinct doublets. Each doublet would integrate to 2 protons. The chemical shift for these protons is usually in the range of 7.0-8.0 ppm. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be further downfield (higher ppm) than the protons ortho to the halogen. So, we expect to see something like `~7.8 ppm (2H, d)` and `~7.6 ppm (2H, d)`.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The acetyl group (-COCH3) has three equivalent methyl protons. Since there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon, this signal will be a **singlet (s)**. It will integrate to **3H**. The chemical shift for protons on a carbon next to a carbonyl group (an alpha-keto methyl group) is typically around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n\n5.  **Compare the prediction with the given options:**\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** `~7.8 (2H, d)`, `~7.6 (2H, d)`, `~2.3 (3H, s)`.\n    *   **Option A) 1H NMR: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**: Incorrect. Lacks the signals for aromatic protons in the 7-8 ppm range.\n    *   **Option B) 1H NMR: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**: Incorrect. The aromatic region is wrong (only 1H), and integrations are suspect.\n    *   **Option C) 1H NMR: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**: Incorrect. The peak at 9.9 ppm indicates an aldehyde, not a ketone. An aldehyde-containing structure consistent with the C8 count (like (halophenyl)acetaldehyde, X-C6H4-CH2CHO) would show coupling between the -CH2- and -CHO protons (a doublet and a triplet), not two singlets.\n    *   **Option D) 1H NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**: This is a perfect match with our prediction for para-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Represents the four protons on the para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: Represents the three protons of the methyl group in the acetyl substituent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is a para-haloacetophenone, and the NMR data in option D correctly describes it.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the molecular formula and functional groups.**\n    *   The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms is 8. Therefore, the substituents on the ring must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X). This means one substituent is a halogen atom (-X) attached directly to the aromatic ring, and the other substituent contains the two carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   A substituent with 2 carbons and a carbonyl group is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n*   **Step 2: Deduce the structure of the compound.**\n    *   Based on Step 1, the compound consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen atom (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3). The molecular formula is C8H7XO. The common name for this type of molecule is a haloacetophenone.\n    *   The problem states it is a di-substituted ring. The substitution can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the provided 1H NMR data options to determine the substitution pattern.**\n    *   Aromatic protons typically appear in the chemical shift range of 6.5-8.5 ppm.\n    *   Let's examine the aromatic region signals in the options:\n        *   A) 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)\n        *   B) No aromatic signals. This option is incorrect.\n        *   C) 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)\n        *   D) 6.9 (1H, s). A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n    *   Both options A and C show a pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons. This is a classic, highly symmetrical pattern characteristic of a **para (1,4) di-substituted** benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, the four aromatic protons exist as two sets of chemically equivalent protons, leading to two signals that appear as doublets due to coupling with their adjacent proton.\n\n*   **Step 4: Predict the full 1H NMR spectrum for the deduced structure (para-haloacetophenone) and compare it with the remaining options (A and C).**\n    *   **Structure:** para-haloacetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4):** As determined in Step 3, we expect two doublets, each integrating to 2H, in the region of ~7.5-8.0 ppm. The protons ortho to the strongly electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be further downfield (higher ppm) than the protons ortho to the halogen.\n    *   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are attached to a carbonyl. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **singlet**. This singlet will integrate to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around **2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Evaluate options A and C against the prediction.**\n    *   **Option A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum has a signal at 9.9 ppm, which is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone.\n        *   It also lacks the 3H singlet around 2.3 ppm for the acetyl methyl group.\n        *   Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This perfectly matches the expected pattern for the 4 aromatic protons in a para-substituted ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet integrating to 3H at a chemical shift of 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches the expected signal for the acetyl methyl group (-COCH3).\n        *   This spectrum is a perfect match for para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a para-haloacetophenone, and the correct 1H NMR data is provided in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Compound's Description**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents. The ring itself has 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate ... an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\n**2. Determine the Possible Structures**\n\nBased on the analysis above:\n*   Substituent 1 is a Halogen (-X).\n*   Substituent 2 must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n\nLet's figure out the structure of the second substituent:\n*   It has 2 carbons and a C=O group.\n*   Possibility A: An acetyl group, **-COCH3**. This fits the criteria. The total structure would be a **haloacetophenone** (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n*   Possibility B: A formylmethyl group, **-CH2CHO**. This also fits the criteria. The total structure would be a **(halophenyl)acetaldehyde** (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n\nBoth structures have 8 carbons, a di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond. Both have the general formula C8H7XO, meaning they should have 7 protons in their 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Options**\n\nThe problem asks us to identify the correct 1H NMR spectrum among the given options. A key feature of a di-substituted benzene ring is that it has 4 aromatic protons, typically appearing in the chemical shift range of 6.5-8.5 ppm.\n\n*   **Option B) `4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)`**: This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the correct answer.\n*   **Option C) `6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)`**: This spectrum shows only one proton in the aromatic region (1H at 6.9 ppm). A di-substituted ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This cannot be the correct answer.\n\nThis leaves us with Option A and Option D. Both show signals in the aromatic region.\n\n**4. Compare Option A and Option D**\n\nLet's analyze the remaining options in the context of our two possible structures. Both options show two doublets for 2 protons each (`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`). This \"two-doublet\" pattern is characteristic of a **para (1,4) substitution** on the benzene ring, where symmetry results in two sets of equivalent protons.\n\n*   **Option D) `1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`**\n    *   This spectrum has a total of 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 protons. This matches our expected proton count for C8H7XO.\n    *   The signal at **2.3 ppm (3H, s)** is a singlet integrating to 3 protons. This is the classic signature of a methyl group next to a carbonyl (**-COCH3**), i.e., an acetyl group.\n    *   The aromatic signals at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm are downfield, which is consistent with the presence of two electron-withdrawing groups (the halogen and the acetyl group) on the ring.\n    *   This spectrum is a perfect match for **4-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **Option A) `1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`**\n    *   This spectrum has a total of 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7 protons. This also matches our expected proton count.\n    *   The signal at **9.9 ppm (1H, s)** is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**.\n    *   The signal at **3.7 ppm (2H, s)** is characteristic of a methylene group (**-CH2-**) attached to an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.\n    *   This spectrum corresponds to the **4-(halophenyl)acetaldehyde** structure.\n    *   **However, there is a significant inconsistency**: In a -CH2-CHO group, the methylene protons and the aldehyde proton are on adjacent atoms and should couple with each other. We would expect the aldehyde proton to be a triplet and the methylene protons to be a doublet. The spectrum incorrectly lists them both as singlets. Furthermore, the aromatic shifts (7.8, 7.6 ppm) are significantly higher than what is typically observed for phenylacetaldehyde derivatives (~7.2-7.4 ppm), as the -CH2- group partially insulates the ring from the carbonyl's strong electron-withdrawing effect.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nComparing the two plausible options, the data in Option D is chemically sound and provides a very accurate description of 4-haloacetophenone. The data in Option A contains inconsistencies in both multiplicity and chemical shift for the proposed 4-(halophenyl)acetaldehyde structure. Therefore, the compound is 4-haloacetophenone, and its correct NMR spectrum is given by option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular structure from the given information.**\n\n1.  **Core Structure:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means it's a benzene ring with two substituents. A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n2.  **Total Carbons:** The compound has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" This means the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n3.  **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A \"carbonyl group\" (C=O) is present.\n    *   An \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (Ar-X) is present. This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, I) directly attached to the benzene ring.\n4.  **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   A substituent with 2 carbons and a carbonyl group is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Thus, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The structure consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen atom and an acetyl group.\n5.  **Isomerism:** Since the ring is di-substituted, there are three possible isomers: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), and para (1,4). The 1H NMR data, particularly the pattern in the aromatic region, will help distinguish between them. A highly symmetric pattern, like two doublets, strongly suggests the para isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the most likely structure (para-haloacetophenone).**\n\n*   **Structure:** A para-substituted benzene ring with -X at position 4 and -COCH3 at position 1.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry along the axis passing through the two substituents. This simplifies the NMR spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons on the ring. Due to symmetry, they are of two types:\n    *   Two protons are ortho to the acetyl group (and meta to the halogen). They are chemically equivalent. They will be split by their single neighbor, resulting in a doublet. These protons are adjacent to the strongly electron-withdrawing carbonyl group, so they will be shifted significantly downfield (typically > 7.7 ppm).\n    *   Two protons are ortho to the halogen (and meta to the acetyl group). They are also chemically equivalent and will appear as a doublet. They will be less downfield than the other pair.\n    *   So, we expect to see **two doublets, each integrating to 2H**, in the aromatic region (7.0-8.0 ppm).\n*   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The acetyl group has three protons. These protons are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **singlet, integrating to 3H**. Because they are attached to a carbonyl carbon, their chemical shift will be around 2.5-2.7 ppm.\n\n**Summary of Predicted Spectrum:**\n*   A doublet (2H) in the aromatic region.\n*   A doublet (2H) in the aromatic region.\n*   A singlet (3H) in the alkyl region (~2.6 ppm).\n\n**Step 3: Compare the prediction with the given options.**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The 9.9 ppm signal is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. The structure would have to be a halo-phenylacetaldehyde. For that structure, the signal at 3.7 ppm (CH2) should be a doublet and the signal at 9.9 ppm (CHO) should be a triplet (or a broad singlet due to small coupling), not singlets as listed. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d):** This pattern perfectly matches the expected two doublets for a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is a singlet integrating to 3H, which perfectly matches the acetyl methyl group. The chemical shift of 2.3 ppm is slightly lower than the typical ~2.6 ppm but is entirely plausible and the most reasonable fit.\n    *   This option is an excellent match for para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be correct for a compound containing a benzene ring.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows only one aromatic proton (1H at 6.9 ppm). A di-substituted benzene ring must have four aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the compound is a para-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data in option B is the only one that correctly represents the number of signals, their multiplicities, integration, and approximate chemical shifts for this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Core Structure:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring) and contains a total of 8 carbon atoms. A benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbons.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The FTIR spectrum shows the presence of:\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X), meaning a halogen atom is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Goal:** Identify the correct 1H NMR spectrum from the four options provided.\n\n**2. Propose a Plausible Chemical Structure**\n\n*   Based on the information, we have a benzene ring with two substituents: a halogen (-X) and another group containing two carbons and a carbonyl group.\n*   The most straightforward and common chemical group that fits the \"2 carbons and a carbonyl\" description is an **acetyl group** (-COCH₃).\n*   Therefore, the most likely structure is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n*   The total number of protons is 4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group, for a total of 7 protons.\n\n**3. Analyze the Effect of Substitution Pattern on the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe two substituents can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4).\n\n*   ***Ortho* and *Meta* Isomers:** In these arrangements, all four protons on the aromatic ring are in different chemical environments. This would lead to a complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region (typically four separate multiplets).\n*   ***Para* Isomer (1,4-disubstituted):** This isomer has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen equivalent to each other. This results in a much simpler spectrum in the aromatic region, typically consisting of two distinct doublets, each integrating to 2H.\n\n**4. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the *para*-Haloacetophenone**\n\nLet's assume the structure is the *para* isomer (4-haloacetophenone) and predict its spectrum:\n\n*   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** These three protons are on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group. They have no neighboring protons to couple with.\n    *   **Signal:** A singlet (s).\n    *   **Integration:** 3H.\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** Typically around 2.1-2.6 ppm for a methyl ketone.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are two sets of equivalent protons.\n    *   **Signal:** Two doublets (d).\n    *   **Integration:** Each doublet will integrate to 2H.\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** Both the acetyl group (-COCH₃) and the halogen (-X) are electron-withdrawing groups, which de-shield the aromatic protons, shifting them downfield (to a higher ppm value) compared to benzene (7.26 ppm). The carbonyl group has a stronger de-shielding effect on its adjacent (ortho) protons. Therefore, we expect one doublet to be further downfield than the other. A reasonable range would be ~7.5-8.0 ppm.\n\n**5. Compare the Predicted Spectrum with the Given Options**\n\n*   **Predicted Spectrum:** A singlet (3H) around 2.3 ppm, and two doublets (2H each) between 7.5 and 8.0 ppm.\n\nNow let's examine the options:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: A 3-proton singlet at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches the methyl group of the acetyl substituent.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: Two 2-proton doublets in the downfield aromatic region. This perfectly matches the pattern for a *para*-substituted benzene ring with two different electron-withdrawing groups. The signal at 7.8 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the more strongly de-shielding carbonyl group, and the signal at 7.6 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the halogen.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match for 4-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts of 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are too low for aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This would imply a different structure, like 4-halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO), which also has 8 carbons. However, in this structure, the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl is insulated from the ring by a -CH₂- group. The aromatic protons would appear at a much lower chemical shift (typically ~7.2-7.4 ppm), not at 7.6 and 7.8 ppm. Therefore, this data is internally inconsistent.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This pattern does not match any plausible structure and contains unusual signals (e.g., a 2H singlet at 1.3 ppm). This is incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only option that correctly describes the 1H NMR spectrum for a compound fitting the given criteria is A. The compound is a 4-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n*   **Step 1: Deduce the molecular structure from the given information.**\n    *   **\"6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring as the core structure, which accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents on the ring must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"di-substituted\"**: There are two groups attached to the benzene ring.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: A carbonyl group is C=O. This group must be part of one of the substituents.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... as well as an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, I), let's denote it as 'X', is directly attached to the aromatic ring. This is one of the two substituents.\n    *   **Combining the substituent information**: One substituent is a halogen (-X). The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   **Proposed Structure**: The compound is a haloacetophenone. Its general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3. This structure has 6 carbons in the ring and 2 carbons in the acetyl group, for a total of 8 carbons, matching all the given information.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for the proposed structure.**\n    *   The structure is a haloacetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n    *   It will have signals from the acetyl group's protons and the aromatic ring's protons.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3)**: The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Since the methyl group is attached to a carbonyl group, it will be deshielded and appear at a chemical shift of approximately 2.0-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Aromatic protons (-C6H4-)**: There are four protons on the di-substituted benzene ring. Their signals will appear in the aromatic region, typically between 6.5 and 8.5 ppm. The pattern of these signals depends on the relative positions of the two substituents (*ortho*, *meta*, or *para*).\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the given 1H NMR data options against the expected spectrum.**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches the expected signal for the acetyl methyl group (-COCH3).\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: These are two signals in the aromatic region. Each is a **doublet (d)** and integrates to **2H**. The total number of aromatic protons is 2H + 2H = 4H, which is correct. A pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring due to its symmetry. The protons *ortho* to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group are more deshielded (7.8 ppm) than the protons *ortho* to the halogen (7.6 ppm). This data is fully consistent with a *para*-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical range for aromatic protons. This option describes a non-aromatic compound.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. An 8-carbon aldehyde could be X-C6H4-CH2CHO. However, for this structure, the aldehyde proton should be a triplet and the -CH2- protons should be a doublet. The provided splitting (two singlets) is incorrect. Also, this structure contains only 7 total protons (4 aromatic + 2 CH2 + 1 CHO), which matches the integration, but the splitting is inconsistent.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   Similar to option B, the signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the aromatic region. Also, a singlet for 2H at 1.3 ppm is highly unusual. This data does not match the described compound.\n\n*   **Conclusion**: Option A is the only choice that accurately represents the 1H NMR spectrum of a haloacetophenone, specifically the *para* isomer. The signals for the acetyl methyl group and the characteristic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring are all present and correct.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n*   **Step 1: Determine the molecular structure from the given information.**\n    1.  **\"6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring, which accounts for 6 carbon atoms and has the formula C6H6 as a base.\n    2.  **\"di-substituted\"**: Two hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring are replaced by two substituent groups. This leaves 4 hydrogen atoms on the ring itself.\n    3.  **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    4.  **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n    5.  **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates ... an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, I) attached directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Step 2: Combine the structural features.**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). A halogen atom has zero carbon atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   A group with two carbons and a carbonyl group is an acetyl group (-C(=O)CH3).\n    *   So, the compound is a haloacetophenone. Its general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3. The molecular formula is C8H7XO, meaning there should be a total of 7 protons in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Step 3: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the possible isomers (ortho, meta, para).**\n    *   **Acetyl group protons (-COCH3)**: This methyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl group and not adjacent to any carbon with protons. It will appear as a singlet (s) integrating to 3 hydrogens (3H). Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 2.0-2.6 ppm because the carbonyl group is deshielding.\n    *   **Aromatic protons**: There are 4 protons on the ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern:\n        *   **ortho (1,2-substitution)**: All 4 protons are chemically different, leading to a complex multiplet pattern in the aromatic region (approx. 7.0-8.0 ppm).\n        *   **meta (1,3-substitution)**: All 4 protons are chemically different, also leading to a complex pattern, although potentially distinguishable from the ortho isomer.\n        *   **para (1,4-substitution)**: Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are only two types of aromatic protons. The two protons ortho to the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the halogen are equivalent. This results in a characteristic pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 hydrogens (2H).\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the given options against the predicted spectrum.**\n    *   The structure we deduced is a haloacetophenone. We expect to see a 3H singlet around 2.3 ppm and 4H of aromatic signals. The total integration should be 3H + 4H = 7H.\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   Total protons: 1+2+2+2 = 7H.\n        *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone (-COCH3). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   Total protons: 1+2+2+2 = 7H.\n        *   The signals are not in the expected chemical shift ranges for an aromatic ketone. The aromatic region is nearly absent. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   Total protons: 2+2+3 = 7H.\n        *   There are no signals in the typical aromatic region (> 6.5 ppm). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   Total protons: 2+2+3 = 7H.\n        *   **2.3 (3H, s)**: This is a perfect match for the methyl protons of an acetyl group (-COCH3). The chemical shift, integration, and splitting are all correct.\n        *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d)**: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, is the classic signature of a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The chemical shifts are appropriate for protons on a ring with electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   This option perfectly describes the 1H NMR spectrum of a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the given information to deduce the structure of the compound.**\n    1.  **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached to it.\n    2.  **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n    3.  **\"FTIR spectrum... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n    4.  **\"FTIR spectrum... indicate... an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the benzene ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n    5.  **Putting it together**: One substituent is -X. The other substituent must account for the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3). Other possibilities like -CH2CHO or -COOCH3 are less likely or lead to spectra that don't match the options.\n    6.  **Proposed Structure**: The compound is a halo-acetophenone. Its structure is X-C6H4-COCH3.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the provided 1H NMR data options to determine the substitution pattern and confirm the structure.**\n    1.  The 1H NMR spectrum of a di-substituted benzene ring shows 4 protons in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    2.  Let's examine the aromatic regions in the options:\n        *   A: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d) -> 4 aromatic protons.\n        *   B: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d) -> Signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are not in the typical aromatic region. The 6.9 ppm signal is only 1H. This is incorrect.\n        *   C: No signals in the aromatic region. This is incorrect.\n        *   D: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d) -> 4 aromatic protons.\n    3.  Both options A and D show two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons. This pattern is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) substituted** benzene ring, where the two substituents are on opposite sides of the ring. This high symmetry results in only two distinct types of aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the full NMR spectra of the remaining options (A and D) to the proposed structure (p-halo-acetophenone).**\n    *   Our proposed structure is p-halo-acetophenone. Let's predict its 1H NMR spectrum:\n        *   **Aromatic Protons**: The acetyl group (-COCH3) is electron-withdrawing and is conjugated with the ring. This will strongly deshield the adjacent protons. The halogen is also electron-withdrawing. We expect two doublets in the range of 7.4-8.0 ppm. This matches the aromatic region in both A and D.\n        *   **Substituent Protons**: The acetyl group has a methyl group (-CH3). These 3 protons are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **singlet (s)**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around **2.1-2.7 ppm**.\n\n    *   Now, let's evaluate options A and D based on this prediction:\n        *   **Option A**: 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): **9.9 (1H, s)**, 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), **3.7 (2H, s)**.\n            *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**, not a ketone.\n            *   The peak at 3.7 ppm (2H) would correspond to a -CH2- group.\n            *   This spectrum corresponds to a different structure, p-halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO). While this structure also has 8 carbons, the chemical shifts listed for the aromatic protons (7.6-7.8 ppm) are too high. For this structure, the carbonyl group is not directly conjugated to the ring, so the aromatic protons would be further upfield (closer to 7.2-7.4 ppm). Thus, the data in option A is internally inconsistent.\n\n        *   **Option D**: 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), **2.3 (3H, s)**.\n            *   The aromatic region (7.8, 7.6 ppm) is consistent with the p-halo-acetophenone structure.\n            *   The peak at **2.3 ppm (3H, s)** is a singlet integrating to 3 protons, and its chemical shift falls squarely in the expected range for an acetyl methyl group.\n            *   This spectrum is a perfect match for the predicted spectrum of **p-halo-acetophenone**. For example, the actual spectrum of p-bromoacetophenone is δ 7.84 (d, 2H), 7.61 (d, 2H), 2.59 (s, 3H), which is very similar to the data in option D.\n\n*   **Conclusion**: The compound is a p-halo-acetophenone, and the correct 1H NMR data is provided in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1.

The most common and simple structures are:\n    *   An **acetyl group** (-COCH3). This has 2 carbons and a C=O.\n    *   A **(phenyl)acetaldehyde** group (-CH2CHO). This also has 2 carbons and a C=O.\n    *   A **(phenyl)acetic acid** group (-CH2COOH). This also fits.\n\n*   This leads to two primary candidate structures:\n    1.  **Halo-acetophenone:** A halogen and an acetyl group on a benzene ring (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n    2.  **Halo-phenylacetaldehyde:** A halogen and a -CH2CHO group on a benzene ring (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n    3.  **Halo-phenylacetic acid:** A halogen and a -CH2COOH group on a benzene ring (X-C6H4-CH2COOH).\n\n*   All these candidates have 8 carbons, are di-substituted aromatic rings, and contain the required functional groups. All would have a molecular formula of C8H7XO, which means they have 7 hydrogen atoms.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n\nLet's evaluate each option against the deduced structures. The total integration for a C8H7XO compound should be 7H.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 2 + 2 + 3 = 7H. This is correct.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum shows no signals in the typical aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm). This is inconsistent with an aromatic compound. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7H. This is correct.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum suggests the structure is halo-phenylacetaldehyde.\n        *   `9.9 (1H, s)`: This is the characteristic chemical shift for an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO).\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets for the aromatic protons is characteristic of **para (1,4) substitution**.\n        *   `3.7 (2H, s)`: This is a plausible shift for a **methylene group** (-CH2-) situated between a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Plausibility Check:** While the signals match the expected types of protons, the chemical shifts for the aromatic protons (`7.8` and `7.6` ppm) are unusually high (deshielded) for a ring substituted with a weakly electron-withdrawing group like -CH2CHO. This makes the option suspect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7H. This is correct.\n    *   **Analysis:** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only shows one proton at 6.9 ppm. This is inconsistent. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 2 + 2 + 3 = 7H. This is correct.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum suggests the structure is halo-acetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Again, this pattern indicates **para (1,4) substitution**. The chemical shifts are appropriate for a ring substituted with a strongly electron-withdrawing group.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a characteristic chemical shift for the protons of a **methyl ketone** (-COCH3). The signal is a singlet because there are no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Plausibility Check:** The structure p-halo-acetophenone is perfectly consistent with this NMR data. The strongly electron-withdrawing acetyl group (-COCH3) deshields the aromatic protons, pushing their chemical shifts downfield to the observed 7.6-7.8 ppm range. The methyl ketone protons are correctly represented by the singlet at 2.3 ppm.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion:**\n\nComparing options B and D, both represent plausible structures that fit the initial description. However, the chemical shifts in option D are much more consistent with its corresponding structure (p-halo-acetophenone) than the shifts in option B are with its corresponding structure (p-halo-phenylacetaldehyde). The high chemical shift of the aromatic protons (7.8 ppm) strongly points to a powerful, directly-attached electron-withdrawing group like an acetyl group, not a group insulated by a CH2 unit.\n\nTherefore, the correct 1H NMR data belongs to a halo-acetophenone.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **Compound Type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached.\n    *   **Total Carbon Atoms:** 8. The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **FTIR Data (Functional Groups):**\n        *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n        *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present.\n\n2.  **Deduce the structure of the compound:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring with a halogen atom (-X) directly attached to it.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms: 2 carbons and 1 oxygen (from the carbonyl group).\n    *   Let's list the possibilities for a 2-carbon, carbonyl-containing substituent:\n        *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. This is a very common and stable functional group. The resulting molecule would be a **halo-acetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3)**.\n        *   **Formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO):** This also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl (aldehyde) group. The resulting molecule would be a **halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO)**.\n\n3.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectra for the possible structures and compare with the given options.**\n    The substitution pattern on the benzene ring can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4). The simplest and most symmetrical pattern is para-substitution, which often results in two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons and appearing as a doublet. Let's analyze the options to see if they fit this pattern.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Option A:** `1H NMR: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)`\n        *   The aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) only shows a singlet for 1H. This is not consistent with a di-substituted ring, which should have 4 aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Option D:** `1H NMR: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)`\n        *   This spectrum has no signals in the aromatic region. The problem explicitly states the compound has an aromatic ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Options B and C:** Both options show two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 & 7.6 ppm), each integrating to 2H. This \"two-doublet, 2H each\" pattern is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) disubstituted benzene ring**. This suggests our compound is para-substituted.\n\n4.  **Detailed analysis of the two remaining plausible structures and their corresponding NMR options.**\n\n    *   **Structure 1: para-halo-acetophenone (matches Option B)**\n        *   **Structure:** A halogen and an acetyl group (-COCH3) are at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4) of the benzene ring.\n        *   **Predicted 1H NMR:**\n            *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent protons on the ring. We expect two signals, each for 2H, appearing as doublets (an AA'BB' system). The electron-withdrawing acetyl group and halogen will shift these protons downfield (to a higher ppm value), typically in the 7.4-8.0 ppm range.\n            *   **Methyl Protons (-COCH3):** The three protons on the methyl group are adjacent to a carbonyl group, not another carbon with protons. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift is around 2.2-2.6 ppm.\n        *   **Comparing with Option B:** `1H NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`\n            *   This matches our prediction perfectly. We have two 2H doublets in the aromatic region and a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm.\n\n    *   **Structure 2: para-halo-phenylacetaldehyde (related to Option C)**\n        *   **Structure:** A halogen and a -CH2CHO group are at opposite ends of the ring.\n        *   **Predicted 1H NMR:**\n            *   **Aromatic Protons:** Similar to above, we expect two 2H doublets.\n            *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This proton is adjacent to the -CH2- group. It should couple with the two CH2 protons and appear as a **triplet (t)** (n+1 rule: 2+1=3). Its chemical shift is very far downfield, typically 9.5-10.0 ppm.\n            *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-):** These two protons are adjacent to the aldehyde proton. They should couple with it and appear as a **doublet (d)** (n+1 rule: 1+1=2). The chemical shift is typically around 3.5-4.0 ppm.\n        *   **Comparing with Option C:** `1H NMR: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`\n            *   This option has the correct types of protons (aldehyde, aromatic, methylene). However, the **splitting is incorrect**. It lists the aldehyde proton as a singlet (`s`) instead of a triplet (`t`), and the methylene protons as a singlet (`s`) instead of a doublet (`d`). This contradicts the rules of spin-spin coupling. Therefore, option C describes an impossible spectrum for this structure.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, the only option that correctly describes the 1H NMR spectrum for a compound fitting the given criteria is B. The compound is a para-halo-acetophenone.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This is a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents, so its formula is C6H4.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A **carbonyl group** (C=O) is present.\n    *   An **aromatic-halogen bond** is present. This means a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Assembling the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms, which are 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The only common and stable arrangement for this is an **acetyl group** (-COCH3).\n*   **Putting it all together:** The compound is a haloacetophenone. The molecular formula is C8H7XO (where X is a halogen).\n\n**2. Consider the Isomers**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as three positional isomers: *ortho* (1,2-), *meta* (1,3-), and *para* (1,4-). The 1H NMR spectrum is highly dependent on the substitution pattern.\n\n*   ***ortho*-haloacetophenone:** The two substituents are adjacent. There is no plane of symmetry bisecting the C-C bonds of the ring. This results in four chemically distinct aromatic protons, which would produce a complex splitting pattern (e.g., multiplets, doublets of doublets, etc.).\n*   ***meta*-haloacetophenone:** The substituents are at positions 1 and 3. Again, there is no plane of symmetry, leading to four distinct aromatic protons and a complex spectrum.\n*   ***para*-haloacetophenone:** The substituents are at positions 1 and 4, opposite each other. The molecule has a plane of symmetry. This makes the two protons next to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons next to the halogen equivalent to each other. This symmetry drastically simplifies the spectrum.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for *para*-haloacetophenone**\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons:**\n    *   There are two sets of equivalent protons.\n    *   The protons ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group (-COCH3) will be deshielded and shifted downfield. They are split by their neighbors (the other set of protons), so they will appear as a **doublet (d)**. The integration will be for **2H**. Chemical shift (δ) is expected around 7.8-8.0 ppm.\n    *   The protons ortho to the halogen (-X) will be less downfield. They are also split by their neighbors, appearing as a **doublet (d)**. The integration will be for **2H**. Chemical shift is expected around 7.4-7.6 ppm.\n*   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n    *   The acetyl group has a methyl group (-CH3). These three protons have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they will appear as a **singlet (s)**. The integration will be for **3H**. Its proximity to the carbonyl group shifts it downfield to about 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n\n**Predicted Spectrum Summary:**\n*   A doublet for 2H around 7.8 ppm.\n*   A doublet for 2H around 7.6 ppm.\n*   A singlet for 3H around 2.3 ppm.\n\n**4. Analyze the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts are in the 4-5 ppm range, not the 7-8 ppm range expected for aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H. It also shows a singlet for 3H at a chemical shift typical for an acetyl methyl group. This perfectly matches the prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The splitting pattern and integrations are inconsistent with any of the haloacetophenone isomers. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The singlet at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO), not a ketone. The proposed structure is a ketone. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only option that correctly describes the 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 8-carbon aromatic compound with a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond (*para*-haloacetophenone) is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Compound's Description:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituent groups attached.\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) as well as an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)\"**: This identifies the nature of the two substituents. One is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the ring. The other substituent must contain the two carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must have the formula C2O. The most common and stable functional group with this composition is an acetyl group: -C(=O)CH3.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a halo-acetophenone.\n\n3.  **Determine the Overall Structure and Isomers:**\n    *   The molecule has the structure X-C6H4-COCH3. The total number of protons is 4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group, for a total of 7 protons.\n    *   The two substituents can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions on the benzene ring. We need to analyze the expected 1H NMR for these possibilities.\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Acetyl Group (-COCH3):** This methyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl and has no neighboring protons. It will always appear as a **singlet** integrating to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is in the range of 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons on the ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern:\n        *   **Para (1,4-substitution):** This isomer is symmetrical. It has two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This typically results in two signals, each appearing as a **doublet**, and each integrating to **2H**. This is a very characteristic pattern for para-substitution.\n        *   **Ortho (1,2-substitution):** All 4 aromatic protons are unique. This would give a complex pattern, likely with four separate signals (or overlapping multiplets), each integrating to 1H.\n        *   **Meta (1,3-substitution):** All 4 aromatic protons are also unique. This would also lead to a complex pattern of four 1H signals.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given NMR Data Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (~7-8 ppm). It is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a methyl ketone (-COCH3). This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals and integrations (e.g., 1.3 ppm for a 2H singlet) do not match our predicted structure. It is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, is the classic signature of a **para-substituted** aromatic ring. The chemical shifts are appropriate for a ring substituted with an electron-withdrawing acetyl group and a halogen.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** `2.3 (3H, s)`. This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm, which is a perfect match for the methyl protons of an **acetyl group**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This spectrum perfectly matches the structure of a para-haloacetophenone.\n\nTherefore, the correct 1H NMR data is described in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents, let's call them X and Y.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring itself contains 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents (X and Y) must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's say this is substituent X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   Substituent X is a halogen (-X). It contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   Substituent Y must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   A functional group with 2 carbons and a carbonyl group is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Therefore, the two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Final Structure:**\n    *   The compound is a haloacetophenone, with the general structure X-C6H4-COCH3. The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. This matches all the given information.\n\n4.  **Analyze Potential Isomers and their Expected 1H NMR:**\n    *   The two substituents can be in the ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions.\n    *   **Ortho and Meta Isomers**: These isomers lack symmetry. They would show four distinct signals in the aromatic region (between ~7.0-8.0 ppm), each integrating to 1H, with complex splitting patterns (doublets, triplets, doublet of doublets, etc.).\n    *   **Para Isomer (1,4-disubstitution)**: This isomer has a plane of symmetry passing through the two substituents. This symmetry makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen group equivalent to each other.\n        *   This results in a simpler aromatic spectrum: two signals, each a doublet, and each integrating to 2H.\n        *   The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it will be more deshielded (further downfield, higher ppm value).\n        *   The methyl group (-CH3) of the acetyl substituent is not adjacent to any protons, so it will appear as a singlet, integrating to 3H. Its chemical shift is typically around 2.5-2.6 ppm.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. This contradicts our deduced structure of an acetophenone. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic region**: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). This is the classic A2B2 pattern for a para (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. It matches our predicted pattern for the para-isomer.\n        *   **Aliphatic region**: 2.3 (3H, s). This is a singlet integrating to 3 protons, which is exactly what we expect for the methyl group of the acetyl substituent.\n        *   While the chemical shift of 2.3 ppm is slightly lower than the typical ~2.6 ppm for an acetyl methyl, the overall pattern (two 2H doublets and one 3H singlet) is a perfect match for 4-haloacetophenone. The minor shift variation is acceptable. This option is a very strong candidate.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the correct spectrum for an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This shows only a single proton in the aromatic region, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which must have 4 aromatic protons). This option is incorrect.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, the structure must be a haloacetophenone. Only Option B provides a spectrum that matches the signal pattern (multiplicity and integration) expected for such a compound, specifically the para-isomer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups from the Clues:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituent groups attached.\n*   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR ... carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O functional group.\n*   **\"FTIR ... aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) bonded directly to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as '-X'.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen, -X. This substituent contains 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms AND the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible structures for a 2-carbon substituent containing a carbonyl group:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This has 2 carbons and a C=O. This is a very common substituent.\n    *   **Carboxylic acid group (-CH2COOH):** This has 2 carbons and a C=O, but would also have a very characteristic broad singlet for the acidic -OH proton, typically above 10 ppm. None of the options show this.\n    *   **Acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO):** This has 2 carbons and a C=O (aldehyde). This is also a possibility.\n\n*   Let's evaluate the two most likely structures:\n    *   **Structure 1: Halo-acetophenone.** A halogen and an acetyl group on a benzene ring. The formula would be X-C6H5-COCH3. This has 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8 carbons. It fits all the criteria.\n    *   **Structure 2: (Halo-phenyl)acetaldehyde.** A halogen and a -CH2CHO group on a benzene ring. The formula is X-C6H5-CH2CHO. This has 6 (ring) + 2 (substituent) = 8 carbons. It also fits all the criteria.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Potential Structure and Compare with Options:**\n\nTo have a simple, clean NMR spectrum with doublets in the aromatic region, the most likely substitution pattern is **para (1,4)**. This symmetry results in only two types of aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Prediction for para-halo-acetophenone (Structure 1):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4):** In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of equivalent protons. We expect two signals, each integrating to 2H. Due to coupling with their ortho neighbors, each signal should be a **doublet (d)**. The protons next to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group will be shifted further downfield (higher ppm) than those next to the halogen. So we expect: `~7.5-8.0 ppm (2H, d)` and `~7.4-7.8 ppm (2H, d)`.\n    *   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH3):** The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. We expect one signal, integrating to 3H, as a **singlet (s)**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around **2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Summary for Structure 1:** Two doublets in the aromatic region (each 2H) and one singlet in the alkyl region (3H).\n\n*   **Prediction for para-(halo-phenyl)acetaldehyde (Structure 2):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4):** Similar to above, we expect two **doublets (d)**, each integrating to 2H in the aromatic region (`~7.0-7.5 ppm`).\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** The single proton of the aldehyde group is unique. It has a very characteristic chemical shift, typically **9.5-10.1 ppm**. It is adjacent to the -CH2- group, so it should be split into a **triplet (t)** by the two CH2 protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). We expect: `~9.7 ppm (1H, t)`.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-):** The two protons of the methylene group are adjacent to the aldehyde proton. They will be split into a **doublet (d)** by the single aldehyde proton (n+1 rule, 1+1=2). The chemical shift would be around **3.5-4.0 ppm**. We expect: `~3.7 ppm (2H, d)`.\n    *   **Summary for Structure 2:** Two doublets (aromatic), one triplet (aldehyde), and one doublet (methylene).\n\n**4. Analyze the Given NMR Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**: The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**: This option corresponds to Structure 2, the acetaldehyde derivative. It has the correct chemical shifts for the aldehyde proton (`9.9 ppm`), methylene protons (`3.7 ppm`), and aromatic protons (`7.8`, `7.6 ppm`). **However, the splitting is wrong.** The aldehyde proton should be a triplet, not a singlet, and the methylene protons should be a doublet, not a singlet, due to mutual coupling. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**: Similar to A, the chemical shifts are not characteristic of an aromatic compound of this type. The integration and splitting are also unusual. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**: This data perfectly matches our prediction for **para-halo-acetophenone (Structure 1)**.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H. This signifies a para-substituted ring.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: A singlet for 3H at a chemical shift characteristic of an acetyl methyl group.\n    \nAll aspects (chemical shifts, integration, and splitting) of this option are consistent with the proposed structure of para-halo-acetophenone, which fulfills all the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Decode the Molecular Information from the Question:**\n\n*   **Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The molecule has 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a combined total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A peak for a **carbonyl group (C=O)** is present.\n    *   A peak for an **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)** is present. This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Propose Possible Structures:**\n\nBased on the information above, let's assemble the molecule:\n*   We have a halogen substituent (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both the carbonyl group and the two required carbon atoms.\n*   A very common chemical group that fits this description is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**. It has two carbons and a carbonyl group.\n\nCombining these pieces, the most likely structure is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula would be C₈H₇XO.\n*   Total Carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. (Correct)\n*   Substituents: A halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃). It is di-substituted. (Correct)\n*   Functional Groups: It has an aromatic-halogen bond and a carbonyl group. (Correct)\n*   Total Protons: The benzene ring has 4 protons (C₆H₄), and the methyl group has 3 protons (-CH₃). The total is 4 + 3 = 7 protons.\n\nAnother possibility could be a (halophenyl)acetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO). This also has 8 carbons, a carbonyl, and an Ar-X bond. We will evaluate the NMR data for both possibilities.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n\nThe correct 1H NMR spectrum must account for 7 protons and match the expected chemical shifts and splitting patterns for our proposed structure(s). Aromatic protons typically appear in the δ 6.5-8.5 ppm range.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 1+2+2+2 = 7 protons. This matches.\n    *   **Analysis:** The chemical shifts at δ 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are too low (upfield) for aromatic protons. Only one aromatic proton (1H) is listed. This is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring which must have 4 aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 2+2+3 = 7 protons. This matches.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum has no signals in the typical aromatic region (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm). The signals at δ 4.6-4.8 are not characteristic of aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 1+2+2+2 = 7 protons. This matches.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum corresponds to the (halophenyl)acetaldehyde structure (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n        *   `δ 9.9 (1H, s)`: Correct region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n        *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d)` & `δ 7.6 (2H, d)`: A pattern of two doublets (each 2H) is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) substituted** benzene ring.\n        *   `δ 3.7 (2H, s)`: Plausible region for the methylene protons (-CH₂-).\n        *   **Splitting Error:** However, in the structure X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO, the methylene (-CH₂) protons are adjacent to the aldehyde (-CHO) proton. Due to spin-spin coupling, they must split each other's signals. The -CH₂- signal should be a **doublet**, and the -CHO signal should be a **triplet**. The data incorrectly lists them both as **singlets (s)**. Therefore, this option is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 2+2+3 = 7 protons. This matches.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum is a perfect match for a **para-haloacetophenone (p-X-C₆H₄-COCH₃)**.\n        *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d)` & `δ 7.6 (2H, d)`: This is the classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted** benzene ring. The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, shifting these protons downfield into the correct range.\n        *   `δ 2.3 (3H, s)`: This is the characteristic signal for an acetyl methyl group (-COCH**₃**). It is a **singlet (s)** because it is not adjacent to any other protons. The chemical shift around δ 2.3-2.6 ppm is expected.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n\nThe data in option D perfectly matches the predicted 1H NMR spectrum for para-haloacetophenone, a molecule that satisfies all the conditions given in the problem statement. The data in option C contains an error in the splitting pattern that makes it inconsistent with its corresponding structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information to determine the compound's structure.**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core structure is a benzene ring with two substituent groups attached. A benzene ring itself has the formula C6H6. When di-substituted, it's C6H4R1R2.\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: This means there is a C=O group in one of the substituents.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the benzene ring. Let's call this substituent -X.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular structure.**\n    *   We have one halogen substituent (-X), which contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both the carbonyl group (C=O) and the 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The most common and stable functional group that fits this description is the **acetyl group** (-COCH3). It has exactly 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n    *   So, the compound is an **acetophenone** molecule with a halogen substituent on the ring. The general structure is **haloacetophenone**.\n    *   The molecular formula would be C8H7XO. This gives a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group), which we should see in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n3.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the proposed structure.**\n    *   The structure is a di-substituted benzene ring. The substitution can be *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4).\n    *   **The Acetyl Group (-COCH3)**: The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and are adjacent to a carbonyl group but have no adjacent protons. They will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around **2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **The Aromatic Protons (on the C6H4 ring)**: There are 4 protons on the ring.\n        *   If the substitution is *ortho* or *meta*, the molecule would be asymmetric. We would expect four distinct signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 1H, with complex splitting patterns (e.g., doublets, triplets, doublets of doublets).\n        *   If the substitution is ***para***, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen equivalent to each other. This creates a classic AA'BB' system, which in many cases simplifies and appears as **two distinct doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the given 1H NMR options against the prediction.**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This perfectly matches the signal for the acetyl methyl group (-COCH3).\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, is the characteristic signature of a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   The total integration is 3H + 2H + 2H = 7H, which is correct.\n        *   **This spectrum is a perfect match for a 4-haloacetophenone.**\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. The compound identified is a ketone. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals at `4.8` and `4.6 ppm` are not in the typical range for aromatic protons (which are usually > 6.5 ppm). This data does not represent an aromatic compound of the type we identified.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   Similar to option C, the chemical shifts `4.8` and `4.6 ppm` are incorrect for aromatic protons. The signal at `1.3 (3H, s)` is too upfield for a methyl ketone.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the compound must be a 4-haloacetophenone. Option A provides the exact 1H NMR data pattern expected for this structure: a singlet for the methyl group and a pair of doublets for the para-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information from the Question:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituent groups attached. The substitution can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **\"FTIR ... carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR ... aromatic-halogen bond\"**: A halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I, let's denote it as -X) is directly attached to the aromatic ring. This is one of the two substituents.\n\n**2. Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   We have two substituents: a halogen (-X) and a group containing 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n*   Let's figure out the structure of the second substituent. It must have the formula C₂HᵧO.\n*   Possible structures for this C₂ substituent with a carbonyl group are:\n    *   **Acetyl group:** -C(=O)CH₃. This has 2 carbons and fits the description.\n    *   **Formylmethyl group:** -CH₂CHO. This also has 2 carbons and fits the description.\n*   Now, let's attach these possibilities to the halo-benzene ring.\n    *   **Structure I:** Halo-acetophenone (X-C₆H₄-C(=O)CH₃)\n    *   **Structure II:** Halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)\n*   Both structures have a total of 8 carbons (6 from the ring, 2 from the side chain), a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond. They both fit the initial description.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectra for the Possible Structures:**\n\nTo distinguish between the two possibilities and the different substitution patterns (ortho, meta, para), let's predict what their 1H NMR spectra would look like. We need a total of 7 protons (4 on the ring, 3 on the side chain for acetophenone; 4 on the ring, 3 on the side chain for phenylacetaldehyde).\n\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for Halo-acetophenone (Structure I):**\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The three protons on the methyl group are adjacent to a carbonyl group, which has no protons. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift is around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons on the ring.\n        *   If the substitution is **para (1,4)**, the molecule is symmetric. We will see two signals, each a **doublet (d)** and each integrating to **2H**. This is a very characteristic pattern. The chemical shift will be in the aromatic region, ~7.4-8.0 ppm, because the acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing.\n        *   If the substitution is ortho or meta, the pattern will be more complex, with four distinct signals for the 4 protons.\n\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for Halo-phenylacetaldehyde (Structure II):**\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is adjacent to the -CH₂- group. It will appear as a **triplet (t)**, integrating to **1H**. It is highly deshielded and will appear far downfield, typically **~9.5-10.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH₂-):** These two protons are adjacent to the aldehyde proton (-CHO). They will appear as a **doublet (d)**, integrating to **2H**. The typical chemical shift is around **3.5-4.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons. A **para** substitution would again give a pattern of two **doublets (d)**, each for **2H**. Because the electron-withdrawing carbonyl is not directly attached to the ring, the chemical shifts would be less downfield than for acetophenone, perhaps around ~7.1-7.5 ppm.\n\n**4. Compare Predicted Spectra with the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm). The signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are too upfield. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows a signal at 9.9 ppm (aldehyde), two doublets in the aromatic region (para-substitution), and a signal at 3.7 ppm (methylene). This matches the functional groups of Structure II (halo-phenylacetaldehyde).\n    *   However, there are discrepancies: the aldehyde and methylene protons are shown as singlets (s), not a triplet and a doublet. Also, the aromatic protons are very far downfield (7.6-7.8 ppm), which is more typical for a group directly attached to the ring like in acetophenone.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This option does not show a clear pattern for either proposed structure. It has signals outside the aromatic region and an unusual integration and multiplicity. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`**: This is the classic, textbook pattern for a **para-substituted benzene ring**. It indicates 4 aromatic protons, split into two sets of 2.\n    *   **`2.3 (3H, s)`**: This is a perfect match for a **methyl group next to a carbonyl** (-C(=O)CH₃). A 3H singlet around 2.3 ppm is highly characteristic.\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches our prediction for **para-halo-acetophenone (Structure I)**. Every detail (chemical shifts, integrations, multiplicities) is consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe data in option D provides a perfect match for p-halo-acetophenone. This molecule fits all the criteria given in the question: it is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, it has 8 carbon atoms, it contains a carbonyl group, and it has an aromatic-halogen bond. The NMR data is a textbook example for this structure. While the data in option B has some features of halo-phenylacetaldehyde, it has significant inconsistencies in multiplicity and chemical shift, making D the far better answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the given information:**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n*   **Total Carbons:** 8 C atoms. Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   Presence of a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   Presence of an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X), meaning a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Goal:** Match this information to one of the provided 1H NMR spectra.\n\n**2. Deduce the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   We have a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible structures for the C2-carbonyl substituent:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This group has exactly 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. This is a very plausible option.\n    *   **Phenylacetaldehyde side chain (-CH2CHO):** This also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n*   Now let's combine these possibilities with the halogen substituent to form the final molecule.\n\n    *   **Possibility 1: Halo-acetophenone.** The structure is X-C6H4-COCH3. This has 6 (ring) + 1 (carbonyl C) + 1 (methyl C) = 8 carbons. It has a di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond. This structure fits all the initial criteria.\n\n    *   **Possibility 2: Halo-phenylacetaldehyde.** The structure is X-C6H4-CH2CHO. This also fits the carbon count and substituent requirements.\n\n**3. Analyze the Expected 1H NMR Spectra for the Possible Structures:**\n\n*   **For Halo-acetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3):**\n    *   There are 4 protons on the aromatic ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution (ortho, meta, or para).\n    *   There are 3 protons on the methyl group (`-CH3`). Since this methyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl and has no adjacent protons, it will appear as a **singlet (s)** with an integration of **3H**. Its chemical shift should be around **2.2-2.7 ppm**.\n\n*   **For Halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO):**\n    *   There are 4 protons on the aromatic ring.\n    *   There is 1 proton on the aldehyde group (`-CHO`). This will appear as a signal far downfield, typically **9-10 ppm**. It would likely be a triplet (t) due to coupling with the adjacent CH2 group.\n    *   There are 2 protons on the methylene group (`-CH2-`). This will appear as a signal around **3.5-4.0 ppm**. It would likely be a doublet (d) due to coupling with the aldehyde proton.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given NMR Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum is inconsistent. It has signals at unusual chemical shifts (4.6-4.8 ppm are too low for aromatic protons). The integration of the upfield singlet is 2H, not 3H, which rules out a methyl group.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), which contradicts the presence of a benzene ring.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is characteristic of a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The downfield shifts indicate the presence of electron-withdrawing groups, which both the halogen and acetyl group are.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** `2.3 (3H, s)`. This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches the expected signal for the methyl group of an acetyl substituent (-COCH**3**).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This spectrum is a perfect match for **para-halo-acetophenone**. This molecule satisfies all the conditions given in the problem.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` indicates an **aldehyde** group.\n    *   The `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` pattern again suggests a para-disubstituted ring.\n    *   The `3.7 (2H, s)` suggests a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   This data would correspond to a structure like 4-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde (CHO-C6H4-CH2X).\n    *   However, in this structure, the halogen is attached to the methyl carbon, not the aromatic ring. This contradicts the FTIR data which specifies an **aromatic-halogen bond**. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option that is fully consistent with all the provided information (8 carbons, di-substituted aromatic ring, carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond) is option C. The compound is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\n*   **Step 1: Determine the molecular structure from the given information.**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means it is a benzene ring with two substituents. A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms (C6).\n    *   The compound has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" Since the ring is C6, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n    *   The FTIR spectrum also shows an \"aromatic-halogen bond,\" meaning one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the benzene ring. Let's denote this as -X.\n    *   The halogen substituent (-X) contains 0 carbon atoms. Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The only common and stable functional group that fits this description is the acetyl group: -C(=O)CH3.\n    *   So, the molecule is a haloacetophenone. It consists of a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom and one acetyl group.\n\n*   **Step 2: Consider the possible substitution patterns and predict the 1H NMR spectrum.**\n    *   The two substituents can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4).\n    *   The question describes a spectrum with a very simple and symmetrical aromatic region (two doublets), which is highly characteristic of a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern.\n    *   Let's predict the spectrum for a *para*-haloacetophenone (1-acetyl-4-halobenzene):\n        *   **Symmetry:** In a *para*-disubstituted ring, there is a plane of symmetry. This makes the two protons adjacent to the acetyl group chemically equivalent to each other. It also makes the two protons adjacent to the halogen atom chemically equivalent to each other.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons (on the ring):** There are 4 protons on the ring. Because of the symmetry, they will appear as two distinct signals.\n            *   The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group (positions 2 and 6) are equivalent. They are split by their neighbors (at positions 3 and 5), so they will appear as a **doublet** integrating to **2H**.\n            *   The protons ortho to the halogen group (positions 3 and 5) are also equivalent. They are split by their neighbors (at positions 2 and 6), so they will also appear as a **doublet** integrating to **2H**.\n            *   The typical chemical shift for aromatic protons is in the range of 6.5-8.5 ppm. Both the acetyl group and the halogen are electron-withdrawing, so the signals will be in the downfield part of this range (e.g., 7.5-8.0 ppm).\n        *   **Acetyl Group Protons:** The acetyl group (-COCH3) has three protons on its methyl group. These three protons are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (a methyl ketone) is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the predicted spectrum with the given options.**\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** Two doublets (each 2H) in the 7.5-8.0 ppm region, and one singlet (3H) in the 2.1-2.6 ppm region.\n    *   **Option A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This is exactly the pattern we expect for the aromatic protons in a *para*-disubstituted ring (two doublets, each for 2H). The chemical shifts are appropriate.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons at a chemical shift perfect for the methyl of an acetyl group.\n        *   This option perfectly matches our prediction.\n    *   **Option B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts (4.8 and 4.6 ppm) are too low for aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **Option C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum shows signals outside the aromatic region and has incorrect integration and multiplicity for our structure. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **Option D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. The problem implies a ketone (the acetyl group, -COCH3) based on the carbon count. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a *para*-haloacetophenone, and its 1H NMR spectrum is best described by option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Information Provided:**\n    *   **Molecular Composition:** The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Core Structure:** It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring with two groups attached to it. A benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen atom directly bonded to the aromatic ring, Ar-X) is confirmed.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We start with the benzene ring (C6). This leaves 2 carbon atoms (8 total - 6 ring = 2) for the two substituents.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contains no carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and simple chemical group that fits this description is the acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Combining these parts, the molecule must be a haloacetophenone. The chemical formula would be C8H7XO.\n\n3.  **Analyze Isomers and Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two substituents (halogen and acetyl group) can be arranged in ortho, meta, or para positions on the benzene ring.\n    *   Let's consider the *para* isomer (p-haloacetophenone). Due to symmetry, the four protons on the aromatic ring are chemically equivalent in pairs. This results in a characteristic A₂B₂ (or AA'BB') splitting pattern in the 1H NMR spectrum, which typically appears as two distinct doublets. Each doublet would integrate to 2 protons (2H).\n    *   The acetyl group (-COCH3) is strongly electron-withdrawing, which will deshield the adjacent aromatic protons (shift them downfield). Halogens are also electron-withdrawing but are pi-donors, so their effect is often less pronounced than a carbonyl group. The aromatic protons will appear in the typical range of δ 7.0-8.0 ppm.\n    *   The methyl group (-CH3) of the acetyl substituent is attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, the methyl protons will appear as a sharp singlet (no adjacent protons to couple with). It will integrate to 3 protons (3H). Its typical chemical shift is around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n    *   In summary, for *p*-haloacetophenone, we expect to see:\n        *   Two doublets in the aromatic region (e.g., ~δ 7.5-8.0 ppm), each for 2H.\n        *   One singlet in the aliphatic region (e.g., ~δ 2.3 ppm) for 3H.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum completely lacks signals in the aromatic proton region (δ 7-8 ppm). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The integrations and multiplicities are inconsistent with the proposed structure. A 2H singlet is not plausible. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d)` and `δ 7.6 (2H, d)`: This is the classic A₂B₂ pattern for a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The integration (2H + 2H = 4H aromatic protons) is correct. The chemical shifts are in the expected downfield region.\n        *   `δ 2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet integrating to 3H, which is a perfect match for the methyl protons of an acetyl group. The chemical shift is also characteristic.\n        *   This data perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for *p*-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This suggests the carbonyl group is an aldehyde. A possible structure could be 4-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde, which has 8 carbons. However, this structure has a *benzylic*-halogen bond (Ar-CH₂-X), not the required *aromatic*-halogen bond (Ar-X). Another possibility, 4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde, has an Ar-X bond but would show different splitting patterns (the aldehyde and CH₂ protons would couple to each other, not be singlets). Thus, this option does not match the compound described.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only NMR data that is fully consistent with a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring containing 8 carbon atoms, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond is option C. The compound is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core structure is a benzene ring with two groups attached (substituents). A benzene ring (C6H6) provides 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 total C - 6 ring C = 2 substituent C).\n    *   **FTIR: Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl group.\n    *   **FTIR: Aromatic-halogen bond:** One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have one halogen substituent (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The most common and stable chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3). It has exactly two carbons and a carbonyl group.\n    *   So, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The general structure is a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom and one acetyl group. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Possibilities based on Isomers:**\n    *   The compound is di-substituted, so it can exist as ortho (1,2-), meta (1,3-), or para (1,4-) isomers. The 1H NMR spectrum will be different for each.\n    *   **Protons on the methyl group (-CH3):** This methyl group is attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, the methyl protons will not be split by any neighbors. They will appear as a **singlet (s)** and will represent 3 hydrogens (**3H**). The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around **2.0-2.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Protons on the aromatic ring:** There are 4 protons on the disubstituted ring. Their appearance depends on the substitution pattern.\n        *   **Ortho and Meta isomers:** These arrangements are less symmetrical. They would typically produce complex spectra with three or four distinct signals in the aromatic region (roughly 7.0-8.0 ppm), often with complex splitting (e.g., triplets, doublets of doublets).\n        *   **Para isomer (1,4-disubstituted):** This arrangement is highly symmetrical. There are only two chemically different types of aromatic protons. The two protons ortho to the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the halogen are equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other. This results in a characteristic pattern of **two doublets (d)** in the aromatic region. Each doublet would integrate to **2H**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Data Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons in the expected region for an acetyl methyl group. This matches our prediction.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: These are two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2 protons. This perfectly matches the pattern expected for a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   This option is a perfect fit for 4-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. This contradicts the likely structure derived from the carbon count. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals at `4.8` and `4.6 ppm` are not in the typical range for aromatic protons (which are usually > 6.5 ppm). This spectrum does not represent the proposed aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum completely lacks signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). It cannot be the spectrum of an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only option that matches all the structural information (8 carbons, disubstituted aromatic ring, carbonyl, halogen) is A. The spectrum is characteristic of a para-substituted acetophenone derivative.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This implies a benzene ring with two groups attached, having the general formula R1-C6H4-R2.\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents (R1 and R2) must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...carbonyl group (C=O)\"**: One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly bonded to the aromatic ring. Let's call this -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   We have one halogen substituent (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain a carbonyl group and the remaining 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   Let's list the possibilities for a C2 substituent with a C=O group:\n        *   **Acetyl group**: -C(=O)CH3. This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl.\n        *   **Formylmethyl group**: -CH2CHO. This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl (from the aldehyde).\n        *   Other possibilities like carboxylic acid (-COOH) only have one carbon, and esters (-COOR) would likely have more than 2 carbons unless R is a proton (which is a carboxylic acid).\n\n3.  **Propose Candidate Molecular Structures:**\n    Based on the above, we have two main structural possibilities:\n    *   **Structure 1**: A benzene ring substituted with a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3). This is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n    *   **Structure 2**: A benzene ring substituted with a halogen (-X) and a formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO). This is a **(halophenyl)acetaldehyde**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Options and Predict Spectra for Candidate Structures:**\n    The options present chemical shifts (δ in ppm), integration (number of protons, e.g., 1H), and multiplicity (singlet (s), doublet (d), etc.).\n\n    *   **Option A) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at **δ 9.9 (1H, s)** is highly characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**. This strongly suggests Structure 2.\n        *   The two doublets at **δ 7.8 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.6 (2H, d)** are a classic signature of a **para (1,4) substituted benzene ring**.\n        *   The peak at **δ 3.7 (2H, s)** is consistent with a **methylene group (-CH2-)** that is benzylic (attached to the ring) and also alpha to a carbonyl group, which both cause a downfield shift.\n        *   **Let's see if this matches Structure 2:** The proposed structure would be **2-(4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n            *   Aldehyde proton (-CHO): Yes, at ~9.9 ppm.\n            *   Methylene protons (-CH2-): Yes, at ~3.7 ppm.\n            *   Para-substituted aromatic protons: Yes, at ~7.8 and ~7.6 ppm.\n            *   *Note on multiplicity*: Technically, the CH2 and CHO protons should couple, resulting in a doublet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CHO. However, this coupling (J-value) is often small (~2-3 Hz) and may not be resolved, causing the peaks to appear as singlets. This is a common simplification in spectroscopy problems. All the chemical shifts and integrations match this structure perfectly.\n\n    *   **Option C) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks the downfield aldehyde peak seen in A.\n        *   The two doublets at **δ 7.8 and 7.6** again suggest a **para-substituted benzene ring**.\n        *   The peak at **δ 2.3 (3H, s)** corresponds to a **methyl group (-CH3)**.\n        *   **Let's see if this matches Structure 1:** The proposed structure would be **4-haloacetophenone**.\n            *   This structure has aromatic protons (4H) and methyl protons (3H), totaling 7 protons, which matches the integration in option C (2H + 2H + 3H = 7H).\n            *   However, the chemical shift for an acetyl methyl group (-COCH3) is typically around **δ 2.5-2.6 ppm**. The value of **δ 2.3 ppm** is unusually low and is more characteristic of a methyl group directly attached to the benzene ring (a tolyl group), which does not contain a carbonyl. This significant discrepancy in chemical shift makes this option less likely.\n\n    *   **Options B) and D)**: These can be quickly eliminated. The chemical shifts (e.g., 4.8, 4.6, 1.3 ppm) are not in the typical range for aromatic protons (which are usually > 6.5 ppm). They do not describe a di-substituted benzene ring.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Option A provides a set of data that is an excellent match for 2-(4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde. The key diagnostic peaks—the aldehyde proton at 9.9 ppm and the benzylic methylene at 3.7 ppm—are at their expected chemical shifts. The aromatic pattern also fits. The only minor discrepancy is the simplified multiplicity, which is acceptable.\n    Option C corresponds to 4-haloacetophenone, but the chemical shift for the methyl group (2.3 ppm) is incorrect for an acetyl group (expected ~2.6 ppm).\n\nTherefore, the data in option A is the correct identification for the described compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6) with two groups attached.\n    *   **Total Carbon Atoms:** 8. The benzene ring itself contains 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows the presence of:\n        *   A carbonyl group (C=O).\n        *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X), meaning a halogen atom is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the molecular structure:**\n    *   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). A halogen atom has 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both the carbonyl group and the 2 required carbon atoms. The simplest and most common functional group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   So, the molecule is a haloacetophenone. Its general structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n\n3.  **Analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for this structure:**\n    *   The molecule has a methyl group (-CH₃) and aromatic protons (-C₆H₄-).\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The methyl group is attached to a carbonyl group. It has no adjacent protons, so it will appear as a **singlet (s)**. It corresponds to **3 hydrogens (3H)**. The chemical shift for a methyl ketone is typically in the range of 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (-C₆H₄-):** A di-substituted benzene ring has **4 aromatic protons (4H)**. Their splitting pattern depends on the positions of the substituents (ortho, meta, or para).\n        *   **Ortho (1,2-substitution):** Would show a complex multiplet for the 4 aromatic protons.\n        *   **Meta (1,3-substitution):** Would also show a complex pattern, likely with 4 distinct signals.\n        *   **Para (1,4-substitution):** Due to the high symmetry of the molecule, there are only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons. This results in a very characteristic pattern: **two doublets (d)**, with each doublet integrating to **2 hydrogens (2H)**. The chemical shift for aromatic protons is typically between 6.5 and 8.5 ppm. Protons closer to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group will be further downfield (higher ppm value).\n\n4.  **Evaluate the given options against the expected spectrum:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This option lacks any signals in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are too low.

The signal at 1.3 ppm is a singlet for 2H, not 3H. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** This is a perfect match for a para-substituted aromatic ring. Two doublets, each for 2 protons, totaling 4 aromatic protons. The chemical shifts are in the correct aromatic region.\n        *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is a singlet for 3 protons at a chemical shift characteristic of an acetyl methyl group.\n        *   This option perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**, not a methyl ketone. If the compound were an aldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CHO), it would only have 7 carbon atoms, which contradicts the problem statement. This is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C is the only one that fits the description of the compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Structure Core:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This most commonly means a benzene ring with two substituents, with the formula C6H4.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The compound contains 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbons.\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This means one of the substituents on the aromatic ring is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I).\n\n**2. Deduce the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   We have a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible structures for a C2 substituent containing a C=O group:\n    *   **-C(O)CH3 (acetyl group):** This is a very common and stable group. It consists of a carbonyl bonded to a methyl group.\n    *   **-CH2CHO (2-oxoethyl group):** This consists of a methylene group (-CH2-) attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   Combining these substituents with the C6H4 core, we get two primary candidate molecules:\n    1.  **Haloacetophenone:** The structure is X-C6H4-C(O)CH3. It has 8 carbons, a di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl, and an Ar-X bond.\n    2.  **(Halophenyl)acetaldehyde:** The structure is X-C6H4-CH2CHO. It also has 8 carbons, a di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl, and an Ar-X bond.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectra for the Candidate Structures**\n\nThe provided NMR options B and C show a pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, which is a classic fingerprint for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. This symmetry simplifies the spectrum, so let's assume this substitution pattern for our predictions.\n\n*   **Prediction for para-Haloacetophenone (Structure 1: p-X-C6H4-C(O)CH3)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons on the ring. Due to para-substitution, they are divided into two chemically equivalent sets. This results in two signals, each integrating to 2 protons. They are adjacent, so they will split each other into doublets (d). The carbonyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it will be downfield (higher ppm). Expected signals: ~7.8-8.0 ppm (2H, d) and ~7.4-7.7 ppm (2H, d).\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, they will not be split and will appear as a singlet (s). The typical chemical shift is around 2.5 ppm. Expected signal: ~2.5 ppm (3H, s).\n    *   **Summary prediction:** Two doublets in the aromatic region (2H each) and one singlet in the aliphatic region (3H).\n\n*   **Prediction for para-(Halophenyl)acetaldehyde (Structure 2: p-X-C6H4-CH2CHO)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** Similar to the above, we expect two doublets (d) for the 4 aromatic protons, each integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** The aldehyde proton is highly deshielded and appears far downfield. It is adjacent to the -CH2- group (2 protons), so it should be split into a triplet (t) by the rule n+1 (2+1=3). Expected signal: ~9.5-10.0 ppm (1H, t).\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-):** These two protons are adjacent to the single aldehyde proton. They will be split into a doublet (d) by the rule n+1 (1+1=2). Their chemical shift would be around 3.7 ppm. Expected signal: ~3.7 ppm (2H, d).\n    *   **Summary prediction:** Two doublets in the aromatic region (2H each), one doublet in the aliphatic region (2H), and one triplet at a very high chemical shift (1H).\n\n**4. Compare Predictions with the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), ... 1.3 (2H, s)**: This data is inconsistent. It only shows one aromatic proton, and the integration of the singlet at 1.3 ppm is unusual. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**:\n    *   Aromatic region: 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d). This matches our prediction for a para-disubstituted ring.\n    *   Aliphatic region: 2.3 ppm (3H, s). This is a methyl singlet.\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches the prediction for **para-haloacetophenone**. All features (integrations, chemical shifts, and splitting patterns) are correct.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**:\n    *   This spectrum has the characteristic aldehyde proton peak at 9.9 ppm and the methylene peak at 3.7 ppm, suggesting the (halophenyl)acetaldehyde structure.\n    *   **However, the splitting patterns are incorrect.** The aldehyde proton is listed as a singlet (s) instead of a triplet (t), and the methylene protons are listed as a singlet (s) instead of a doublet (d). This indicates an absence of the expected coupling between these adjacent protons, which is chemically implausible under normal conditions.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**: This option lists no signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). A di-substituted aromatic ring must have aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption B is the only choice that describes a chemically correct and self-consistent 1H NMR spectrum that corresponds to a molecule (para-haloacetophenone) fitting all the structural and spectroscopic information given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (which has 6 carbons) with two substituents attached. The core formula of this part is C6H4.\n*   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the benzene ring. A halogen atom contains zero carbon atoms.\n\nBased on this, we can deduce the two substituents:\n*   Substituent 1: A halogen (-X). This accounts for 0 of the 2 carbons.\n*   Substituent 2: A group that contains the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable chemical group fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n\nSo, the molecule is an **acetophenone** with a halogen substituent on the aromatic ring. The general structure is **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO. Let's check the proton count: 4 protons on the aromatic ring and 3 protons on the methyl group, for a total of 7 protons.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the Proposed Structure**\n\nThe structure has two main parts that will give signals in the 1H NMR spectrum:\n*   **The acetyl group (-COCH3)**: The three methyl protons (-CH3) are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **singlet (s)**. Since there are three of them, the integration will be **3H**. The chemical shift for protons of a methyl group next to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone) is typically in the range of **2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n*   **The aromatic protons**: There are 4 protons on the di-substituted benzene ring. Their chemical shift and splitting pattern depend on the relative positions of the two substituents (*ortho*, *meta*, or *para*).\n    *   Both the halogen (-X) and the acetyl (-COCH3) groups are electron-withdrawing, which means they will de-shield the aromatic protons, causing them to appear at a relatively high chemical shift (downfield), typically in the **7.0-8.5 ppm** range.\n    *   Let's consider the splitting pattern for the most common isomers:\n        *   ***para* (1,4) substitution**: The molecule has a plane of symmetry. This makes the two protons next to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons next to the halogen equivalent to each other. This results in two signals in the aromatic region. Each signal is split by its one neighbor, resulting in two **doublets (d)**. The integration for each doublet will be **2H**. This pattern (two doublets, each 2H) is a classic fingerprint for *para*-disubstitution.\n        *   ***ortho* (1,2) or *meta* (1,3) substitution**: These isomers lack the symmetry of the *para* isomer. All four aromatic protons would be chemically distinct, leading to a much more complex spectrum with four separate signals (e.g., doublets, triplets, multiplets), each with an integration of 1H.\n\n**3. Compare the Predicted Spectrum with the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's analyze the choices:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s)**: This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches the methyl group of our acetyl substituent (-COCH**3**).\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d)**: These are two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. This pattern is the hallmark of a *para*-substituted benzene ring. The chemical shifts are appropriately downfield due to the electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   This option is an excellent match for **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical range for aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring should have 4 aromatic protons. This data shows only one proton in the aromatic region (6.9 ppm). This is inconsistent.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO), not a ketone. The deduced structure is a ketone (-COCH3). This is a fundamental mismatch.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A is the only one that matches all the structural features deduced from the problem description. The compound is a *para*-haloacetophenone, and the provided 1H NMR data correctly describes it with a singlet for the methyl ketone and two doublets for the *para*-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information Provided:**\n\n*   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents attached.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** A total of 8 carbon atoms. A benzene ring contains 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must have 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond is present, meaning a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   Based on the information, we have a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining two carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   The most common and stable chemical group that fits the description \"2 carbons and a carbonyl group\" is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n*   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. Its general structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n*   Let's check the carbon count: 6 carbons in the ring + 2 carbons in the acetyl group = 8 carbons total. This is correct.\n*   Let's check the functional groups: We have an aromatic-halogen bond (X-C₆) and a carbonyl group (in -COCH₃). This is also correct.\n\n**3. Analyze the Isomers and Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\nThe two substituents (-X and -COCH₃) can be arranged in three possible positions on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4). The 1H NMR spectrum will be different for each isomer.\n\n*   **Ortho and Meta Isomers:** In these isomers, all four protons on the benzene ring are chemically non-equivalent. This would result in a complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region (typically 4 different signals, likely multiplets).\n*   **Para Isomer (1,4-disubstitution):** This isomer is symmetrical. The four protons on the benzene ring are chemically equivalent in two pairs.\n    *   This high symmetry leads to a much simpler and very characteristic 1H NMR pattern for the aromatic region: **two doublets**, with each doublet integrating to **2 protons**.\n    *   The acetyl group (-COCH₃) contains a methyl group with three equivalent protons. Since the adjacent atom (the carbonyl carbon) has no protons, this methyl group will appear as a **singlet** integrating to **3 protons**. The chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl is typically around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   The aromatic protons are deshielded and will appear further downfield, typically in the **7.0-8.0 ppm** range.\n\n**Summary of Predicted Spectrum for p-Haloacetophenone:**\n*   A singlet (3H) around 2.3 ppm.\n*   A doublet (2H) in the aromatic region.\n*   Another doublet (2H) in the aromatic region.\n\n**4. Compare the Prediction with the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts are incorrect. 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are too low for aromatic protons. 1.3 ppm is too low for an acetyl methyl group.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a ketone. The compound described has a ketone (in the acetyl group). This option is inconsistent with the deduced structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The integration and splitting patterns are incorrect. A di-substituted ring should have 4 aromatic protons, but this option only accounts for 1 aromatic proton (6.9 ppm, s).\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, is the classic signature of a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The chemical shifts are appropriate for aromatic protons.\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is a singlet for 3 protons at a chemical shift characteristic of an acetyl methyl group.\n    *   This option perfectly matches our predicted spectrum for a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is a para-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data provided in option D is the only one that correctly describes this structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information about the compound:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents.\n    *   **Molecular Formula Hint:** It contains 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbons (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **FTIR Data:**\n        *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n        *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Propose a plausible structure:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring with two substituents.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   A functional group that fits this description perfectly is the acetyl group (-COCH₃). It has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃). This structure has 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8 carbon atoms, a carbonyl group, an aromatic-halogen bond, and is di-substituted.\n\n3.  **Determine the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para):**\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum provides clues about the relative positions of the substituents. Let's analyze the aromatic region of the given options.\n    *   A para (1,4) substituted benzene ring with two different groups typically shows a symmetrical pattern in the aromatic region: two distinct signals, each appearing as a doublet, and each integrating to 2 protons. This is due to the plane of symmetry through the C1-C4 axis.\n    *   Ortho (1,2) and meta (1,3) substitutions usually result in more complex splitting patterns with four distinct signals (or overlapping multiplets) for the four aromatic protons.\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the proposed structure (4-haloacetophenone):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C₆H₄):** Assuming para-substitution (which gives the simplest and most recognizable pattern), we expect two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). Each doublet would correspond to 2 protons. The protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group (-COCH₃) would be more deshielded and appear at a higher chemical shift (further downfield) than the protons adjacent to the halogen. So, we'd expect something like: **~7.8 ppm (2H, d)** and **~7.6 ppm (2H, d)**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-COCH₃):** The three protons of the methyl group are attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, this signal will be a **singlet (s)**. Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 2.1-2.6 ppm. The integration will be for **3 hydrogens (3H)**. So we'd expect: **~2.3 ppm (3H, s)**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the given options against the prediction:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a methyl ketone (-COCH₃). This contradicts our most likely structure.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical aromatic proton region (6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the correct spectrum for an aromatic compound.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). This perfectly matches the expected pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** 2.3 (3H, s). This perfectly matches the expected signal for an acetyl methyl group.\n        *   This option is an excellent match for the predicted spectrum of 4-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum shows only one proton in the aromatic region (6.9 ppm, 1H), which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which should have 4 aromatic protons).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is a 4-haloacetophenone. Its 1H NMR spectrum consists of two doublets in the aromatic region for the four ring protons and a singlet in the aliphatic region for the three methyl protons. Option C is the only one that matches this description.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n**1. Decode the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents attached. The base formula for this part is C₆H₄.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This is a crucial piece of information. It means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring. So, one of the substituents is simply a halogen, -X.\n\n**2. Combine the Structural Pieces**\n\n*   We know one substituent is a halogen (-X). Halogens do not contain any carbon atoms.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent must account for both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms AND the carbonyl group.\n*   The most common and logical chemical group that fits the description of having 2 carbons and a carbonyl group is an **acetyl group**: -C(=O)CH₃.\n\n**3. Propose the Final Structure**\n\n*   Combining all the pieces, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The two substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n*   The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO. The number of protons is 4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group, for a total of **7 protons**.\n\n**4. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum and Compare with Options**\n\nNow, we need to consider the possible isomers (*ortho*, *meta*, *para*) and predict their general 1H NMR patterns.\n\n*   **Key signals to look for**:\n    *   A singlet for the 3 protons of the methyl group (-CH₃), deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl. This signal should appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm.\n    *   Signals for the 4 protons on the aromatic ring, in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). The splitting pattern will depend on the substitution pattern.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum is inconsistent. It lacks the characteristic 3H singlet for an acetyl group's methyl protons. Instead, it has a 2H singlet at 1.3 ppm. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The singlet at 9.9 ppm is a definitive sign of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not an acetyl group. Although this structure could have 8 carbons (e.g., p-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde, CH₂(X)-C₆H₄-CHO), the halogen would be on the methyl group, not the aromatic ring. This contradicts the \"aromatic-halogen bond\" information from the FTIR.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Proton count**: 2H + 2H + 3H = 7H. This matches our expected total number of protons.\n    *   **Methyl signal**: There is a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm. This is a perfect match for the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n    *   **Aromatic signals**: There are two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. This clean pattern of two doublets is highly characteristic of a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring.\n    *   **Conclusion for C**: This data perfectly describes *para*-haloacetophenone. All conditions are met: 8 carbons, a di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, an aromatic-halogen bond, and the correct NMR signals and splitting pattern.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum has no signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the correct data for an aromatic compound.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence strongly points to the compound being *para*-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data provided in option C is a classic textbook example of such a molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **Molecular Framework:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring with two substituents. A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms (C6).\n    *   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The molecule has a total of 8 carbon atoms. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n        *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl group.\n        *   **Aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** A halogen atom (like F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring. This means one of the two substituents is simply a halogen atom (-X).\n\n2.  **Deduce the Structure:**\n    *   We have established that the two substituents on the benzene ring are:\n        1.  A halogen atom (-X).\n        2.  A substituent containing 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n    *   Let's figure out the second substituent. A group with 2 carbons and a C=O can be an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Combining these pieces, the molecule must be a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7OX. This structure fits all the initial criteria.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Options based on the Deduced Structure:**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring can be *ortho* (1,2-), *meta* (1,3-), or *para* (1,4-). Each substitution pattern gives a characteristic set of signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n    *   The proposed structure is a haloacetophenone. Let's examine the expected NMR signals. The molecule has two types of protons: aromatic protons on the ring and aliphatic protons on the acetyl group's methyl part.\n    *   **Protons on the acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. It has 3 protons and no adjacent protons, so it will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its chemical shift is typically around 2.2-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Protons on the aromatic ring:** There are 4 protons on the di-substituted ring.\n        *   If the substitution is **para (1,4-)**, the molecule is symmetric. There are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This symmetry results in a very clean and characteristic pattern of **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. This is often referred to as an AA'BB' system.\n        *   If the substitution is *ortho* or *meta*, the spectrum would be more complex, typically showing four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic region:** `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This is the classic pattern for a **para-substituted** aromatic ring. It accounts for the 4 aromatic protons.\n        *   **Aliphatic region:** `2.3 (3H, s)`. This is a singlet for 3 protons, which perfectly matches an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This spectrum is fully consistent with the structure of **p-haloacetophenone**. All features match our deduced structure.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum shows only one aromatic proton (`6.9 (1H, s)`), which contradicts the presence of a di-substituted benzene ring (which must have 4 aromatic protons). This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum has **no signals** in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). Therefore, it cannot represent an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**.\n        *   The aromatic signals `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` indicate **para-substitution**.\n        *   The signal at `3.7 (2H, s)` corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n        *   This data would correspond to a structure like *p*-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde. The total carbons would be C6 (ring) + C1 (aldehyde) + C1 (methyl) = 8 carbons. This fits the carbon count and the carbonyl group requirement.\n        *   **Crucial Flaw:** In this proposed structure, the halogen is attached to the methyl group (-CH2X), which is an *aliphatic*-halogen bond, not an *aromatic*-halogen bond (Ar-X) as specified by the FTIR data. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nOption A is the only choice that is perfectly consistent with all the provided information: an 8-carbon, di-substituted aromatic ring containing a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond, showing the characteristic 1H NMR signals for a *para*-substituted acetophenone derivative.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the given information:**\n\n*   **Molecular Structure:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it is a benzene ring with two groups attached, having the general formula C6H4(Substituent 1)(Substituent 2).\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring itself contains 6 carbons, the two substituents must collectively contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) bonded directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Structure of the Compound:**\n\n*   Let's identify the two substituents.\n    *   Substituent 1 is a Halogen (let's call it -X). It contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   Substituent 2 must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable arrangement for a C2 unit with a carbonyl is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n\n*   Combining these pieces, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The structure consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen atom (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n*   The molecular formula would be C8H7XO (where X is a halogen). Let's count the protons: The benzene ring starts with 6 protons. Replacing two with substituents leaves 4 aromatic protons. The acetyl group's methyl (-CH3) has 3 protons. So, the total number of protons is 4 + 3 = 7.\n\n**3. Analyze the Substitution Pattern and Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\nThe two substituents can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n\n*   **Ortho- and Meta-substitution:** These patterns would result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, leading to a complex multiplet in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum (typically between δ 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n*   **Para-substitution (1,4):** This pattern creates a plane of symmetry in the molecule. The two protons ortho to the acetyl group are chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the halogen are also chemically equivalent. This simplification results in a characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: two signals, each integrating to 2 protons. Due to coupling with their neighbors, these signals typically appear as two distinct **doublets**.\n\nThe acetyl group's methyl protons (-CH3) are attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, these 3 protons will appear as a **singlet**.\n\n**Predicted Spectrum for a 4-haloacetophenone:**\n*   Aromatic region: Two doublets, each for 2H.\n*   Aliphatic region: One singlet, for 3H.\n*   Total Protons: 2 + 2 + 3 = 7.\n\n**4. Compare the Prediction with the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Pattern:** This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) and a singlet in the aliphatic region (2.3 ppm). This perfectly matches the pattern predicted for a para-substituted haloacetophenone.\n    *   **Integration:** 2H + 2H + 3H = 7 protons. This matches our calculated proton count.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The signals at δ 7.8 and δ 7.6 are in the expected region for an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups. The signal at δ 2.3 is a reasonable chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone). This option is a strong candidate.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at δ 9.9 is characteristic of an **aldehyde** (-CHO). An aldehyde group contains only one carbon. If the substituents were an aldehyde and a halogen, the total carbon count would be 6 (ring) + 1 (aldehyde) = 7, which contradicts the given total of 8 carbons. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only shows one proton at δ 6.9, and it's a singlet. This is inconsistent with the required structure. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum has **no signals in the aromatic region** (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm). Therefore, it cannot represent an aromatic compound. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly Option A provides a 1H NMR spectrum that is fully consistent with the structural features deduced from the problem statement: an 8-carbon, di-substituted aromatic compound containing a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond (specifically, a para-haloacetophenone).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\n*   **Step 1: Decode the information from the problem statement to deduce the molecular structure.**\n    1.  **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents.\n    2.  **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    3.  **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group. A carbonyl group has one carbon atom.\n    4.  **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring. A halogen is not a carbon atom.\n    5.  **Putting it all together**: We have a benzene ring substituted with a halogen (-X) and another substituent that contains the remaining two carbons and the carbonyl group. The only common and stable group that fits this is an acetyl group (-COCH₃). This substituent has two carbons and a carbonyl group.\n    6.  **The compound's structure**: The compound is a haloacetophenone. The general formula is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃. Since it is di-substituted, it can be the *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* isomer.\n\n*   **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for the deduced structure and compare it with the given options.**\n    *   The structure X-C₆H₄-COCH₃ has two types of protons: those on the aromatic ring and those on the methyl group.\n    *   **Methyl protons (-COCH₃)**: These three protons are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Therefore, they will appear as a single sharp signal, a **singlet (s)**, with an integration of **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone) is around 2.0 - 2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Aromatic protons (-C₆H₄-)**: There are four protons on the ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern (*ortho*, *meta*, or *para*).\n        *   An *ortho* or *meta* substitution pattern would result in four distinct aromatic protons, leading to a complex multiplet in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n        *   A *para* (1,4) substitution pattern results in a highly symmetric molecule. There are only two types of aromatic protons, each group having two equivalent protons. This gives a characteristic pattern of **two doublets (d)** in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm), with each doublet integrating to **2H**. The two doublets arise from the mutual splitting of the two adjacent, non-equivalent proton sets.\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the given ¹H NMR data options.**\n    *   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This matches the predicted signal for the methyl group (-COCH₃) perfectly in terms of chemical shift, integration, and multiplicity.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, in the aromatic region is the classic signature of a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield position (7.6-7.8 ppm) is consistent with protons on a ring attached to two electron-withdrawing groups (halogen and acetyl).\n        *   This option is a perfect match for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals at 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are not in the typical aromatic region. The integration for the upfield singlet (2H) is incorrect for a methyl group. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. While a molecule like *para*-halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO) would fit the carbon count and FTIR data, the multiplicity given is incorrect. The aldehyde proton (-CHO) and the adjacent methylene protons (-CH₂-) would split each other, resulting in a triplet and a doublet, respectively, not two singlets. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.0 ppm), which is impossible for the described compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion**: Option A is the only one that correctly represents the ¹H NMR spectrum for a compound fitting all the described characteristics. The compound is a *para*-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core structure is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents. The substitution can be *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4).\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl functional group.\n    *   **FTIR shows an aromatic-halogen bond:** One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). It has 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. Let's list the possibilities for a 2-carbon group containing a carbonyl:\n        *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This group has 2 carbons and a carbonyl. This is a very common substituent.\n        *   **Formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO):** This group has 2 carbons and a carbonyl (aldehyde). This is also a possibility.\n        *   **Carboxy group (-COOH) is not possible** as it only has 1 carbon. An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) would have 3 carbons.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Possible Molecular Structures:**\n    Based on the above, the molecule must be a halo-substituted benzene ring with either an acetyl or a formylmethyl group.\n    *   **Structure I:** A halo-acetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n    *   **Structure II:** A halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n\n4.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data in the Options:**\n    The key to distinguishing the correct structure and its isomerism (*ortho*, *meta*, *para*) is the 1H NMR spectrum. Let's focus on the aromatic region first.\n    *   Options **A** and **B** both show an aromatic region with two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons: `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This AA'BB' splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a **para (1,4) substituted** benzene ring.\n    *   Options C and D lack the typical signals for aromatic protons (which are usually found > 6.5 ppm) and have unusual patterns, so they can be confidently eliminated.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Two Remaining Possibilities (Para-substituted isomers):**\n    We are now choosing between the 1H NMR spectra for `p-halo-acetophenone` and `p-halo-phenylacetaldehyde`.\n\n    *   **Possibility 1: Corresponds to Option B (p-halo-acetophenone)**\n        *   **Structure:** A halogen and an acetyl group (-COCH3) are in a para-arrangement on the benzene ring.\n        *   **Expected Spectrum:**\n            *   **Aromatic protons:** A para-substituted ring with an electron-withdrawing group like -COCH3 gives two doublets, typically between 7.4-8.0 ppm. This matches `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`.\n            *   **Acetyl protons (-COCH3):** A methyl group attached to a carbonyl gives a singlet (no adjacent protons) for 3H. The typical chemical shift is ~2.1-2.6 ppm.\n        *   **Option B:** `1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`. This spectrum is a very good match for the p-halo-acetophenone structure.\n\n    *   **Possibility 2: Corresponds to Option A (p-halo-phenylacetaldehyde)**\n        *   **Structure:** A halogen and a formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO) are in a para-arrangement on the benzene ring.\n        *   **Expected Spectrum:**\n            *   **Aromatic protons:** The -CH2CHO group is not directly conjugated with the ring. Its electron-withdrawing effect is weaker (inductive only) than a directly attached carbonyl. Therefore, the aromatic protons would be expected at a lower chemical shift (more upfield) compared to acetophenone.\n            *   **Aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is highly deshielded and gives a signal at ~9-10 ppm.\n            *   **Methylene protons (-CH2-):** These protons are benzylic and adjacent to an aldehyde, typically appearing around ~3.5-4.0 ppm.\n        *   **Option A:** `1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`. While the aldehyde (9.9 ppm) and methylene (3.7 ppm) shifts are plausible, the aromatic shifts (7.8, 7.6 ppm) are too far downfield. A non-conjugated group like -CH2CHO would result in aromatic signals closer to 7.2-7.4 ppm. The strong deshielding to 7.6-7.8 ppm indicates a powerful, directly conjugated electron-withdrawing group like the ketone in acetophenone.\n\n6.  **Search for Reference Data (Confirmation):**\n    To confirm this reasoning, we can look up typical values.\n    *   The 1H NMR of `p-bromoacetophenone` shows signals at ~7.80 ppm (d, 2H), ~7.61 ppm (d, 2H), and ~2.59 ppm (s, 3H). This is an excellent match for the pattern and chemical shifts in Option B.\n    *   The 1H NMR of `p-chlorophenylacetaldehyde` shows signals at ~7.3 ppm (d, 2H), ~7.2 ppm (d, 2H), ~9.7 ppm (t, 1H), and ~3.6 ppm (d, 2H). The aromatic shifts here are significantly different from what is given in Option A.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The NMR data in Option B is highly consistent with the structure of a `p-halo-acetophenone`. The aromatic shifts, integration, and multiplicity strongly support a para-substituted ring with a conjugated carbonyl group. The signal at 2.3 ppm represents the methyl of the acetyl group.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Decipher the Compound's Structure from the Description**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two groups attached to it. A benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms and, when di-substituted, 4 hydrogen atoms attached to the ring (C6H4).\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) as well as an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)\"**: This tells us about the functional groups present. One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. The other substituent must contain the two carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n\n**2. Assemble the Substituents**\n\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must have the formula C2O. A very common and stable chemical group that fits this description is the acetyl group: -COCH3.\n*   Let's check other possibilities for a 2-carbon carbonyl-containing group. Another option is -CH2CHO.\n\n**3. Propose Candidate Structures**\n\n*   **Structure 1 (from -COCH3 substituent): Haloacetophenone.**\n    *   This compound consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen and an acetyl group.\n    *   Total carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. This matches.\n    *   It has the required functional groups (Ar-X, C=O).\n\n*   **Structure 2 (from -CH2CHO substituent): (Halophenyl)acetaldehyde.**\n    *   This compound consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen and a -CH2CHO group.\n    *   Total carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (-CH2CHO) = 8. This also matches.\n    *   It has the required functional groups (Ar-X, C=O).\n\n**4. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Structure and Compare with Options**\n\nLet's analyze the expected signals for each structure. The substitution can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4). The provided options show a simple pattern (two doublets) in the aromatic region, which is highly characteristic of para (1,4) substitution. We will assume a para-substituted ring.\n\n*   **Prediction for para-Haloacetophenone (Structure 1)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4)**: In a para-disubstituted ring, there are two sets of equivalent protons. This results in two signals, each appearing as a doublet due to splitting by the adjacent proton. Each doublet should integrate to 2H. The chemical shift will be in the aromatic region, typically 7.0-8.0 ppm.\n    *   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH3)**: The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This will result in a singlet signal integrating to 3H. The chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl is typically 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Summary Prediction:**\n        *   ~7-8 ppm (2H, d)\n        *   ~7-8 ppm (2H, d)\n        *   ~2.1-2.6 ppm (3H, s)\n\n*   **Prediction for para-(Halophenyl)acetaldehyde (Structure 2)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4)**: Same as above, two doublets, each integrating to 2H, in the 7.0-8.0 ppm region.\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO)**: The single proton of the aldehyde group is adjacent to the two CH2 protons. It should appear as a triplet. The chemical shift for an aldehyde proton is very distinct, typically 9.5-10.0 ppm.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-)**: The two protons of the methylene group are adjacent to the single aldehyde proton. They should appear as a doublet. The chemical shift for protons on a carbon between a benzene ring and a carbonyl is typically 3.5-4.0 ppm.\n    *   **Summary Prediction:**\n        *   ~9.5-10.0 ppm (1H, t)\n        *   ~7-8 ppm (2H, d)\n        *   ~7-8 ppm (2H, d)\n        *   ~3.5-4.0 ppm (2H, d)\n\n**5. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This matches the chemical shifts for the acetaldehyde structure (aldehyde H at 9.9, aromatic Hs at 7.8/7.6, methylene Hs at 3.7). However, the multiplicities are incorrect. The aldehyde proton should be a triplet (t), not a singlet (s), and the methylene protons should be a doublet (d), not a singlet (s). This option is incorrect due to the inconsistent splitting patterns.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the typical aromatic proton region (7-8 ppm). It is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, which is classic for a para-substituted ring.\n    *   It also shows a singlet integrating to 3H at 2.3 ppm, which is a perfect match for an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   This data perfectly matches our prediction for para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum also lacks signals in the aromatic proton region. It is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe 1H NMR data in option C is the only one that perfectly matches a molecule that satisfies all the conditions described in the problem. The molecule is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two groups attached to it (formula C₆H₄XY).\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring itself contains 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents (X and Y) must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O functional group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's designate this as -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the molecular structure:**\n    *   We have a halogen substituent (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must account for the remaining 2 carbon atoms and contain the carbonyl group.\n    *   The simplest and most common group that fits this description (2 carbons, one carbonyl) is the acetyl group, -COCH₃.\n    *   So, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The two substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃). The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. This fits all the given criteria.\n\n3.  **Analyze the possible isomers and predict the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n    *   The two substituents can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n    *   Let's consider the symmetry of each isomer, as this greatly influences the 1H NMR spectrum:\n        *   **Ortho and Meta isomers**: These are asymmetrical. They would have four distinct signals for the four protons on the aromatic ring, likely resulting in a complex multiplet pattern.\n        *   **Para isomer**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen equivalent to each other.\n    *   **Predicted spectrum for the para isomer (p-haloacetophenone):**\n        *   **Aromatic Region (6.5-8.5 ppm):** We expect two distinct signals for the aromatic protons.\n            *   One signal for the 2 protons next to the acetyl group.\n            *   One signal for the 2 protons next to the halogen.\n            *   Each signal will be a doublet because its protons are coupled to the other set of protons (ortho-coupling).\n            *   Therefore, the aromatic region should show two doublets, each integrating to 2H.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** We have the acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n            *   The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n            *   This will produce a singlet, integrating to 3H. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone (Ar-CO-CH₃) is around 2.2-2.6 ppm.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the given 1H NMR options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, in the aromatic region is the classic signature of a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons, which perfectly corresponds to the methyl group of an acetyl substituent.\n        *   This option perfectly matches our predicted spectrum for p-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not a ketone. The rest of the signals do not fit a simple, logical structure consistent with the prompt.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts `4.8` and `4.6` are not in the typical range for aromatic protons (6.5-8.5 ppm). This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   Again, the signals at `4.8` and `4.6` are not in the aromatic region. This option is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only 1H NMR data that is consistent with the deduced structure of p-haloacetophenone is Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents attached to it. The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring. This halogen atom is one of the two substituents.\n\nLet's assemble the structure:\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The simplest and most common chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃). This group contains a carbonyl (C=O) and two carbons.\n\nSo, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n**2. Analyze the Possible Isomers and their Expected 1H NMR Spectra:**\n\nThe two substituents (-X and -COCH₃) can be arranged in three possible positions on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n\n*   **Protons from the Acetyl Group:** The acetyl group (-COCH₃) has a methyl group. These 3 protons are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will always appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone) is typically around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n\n*   **Protons from the Aromatic Ring:** The benzene ring has 4 protons.\n    *   **Ortho (1,2) and Meta (1,3) Isomers:** In these arrangements, the molecule has low symmetry. The 4 aromatic protons would be chemically non-equivalent and would split each other, resulting in a complex pattern of multiplets (e.g., doublets, triplets, doublet of doublets) in the aromatic region of the spectrum (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm).\n    *   **Para (1,4) Isomer:** This isomer is highly symmetrical. There are only two types of aromatic protons due to a plane of symmetry passing through the two substituents.\n        *   The 2 protons ortho to the acetyl group are equivalent.\n        *   The 2 protons ortho to the halogen group are equivalent.\n        *   Each set of protons splits the other, so the aromatic region will show two distinct **doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n\nNow, let's compare the predicted spectra with the choices provided:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone.\n    *   The singlet at 3.7 ppm integrates to 2H, not 3H, which is inconsistent with an acetyl methyl group. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d):** This pattern perfectly matches the expected signal for the 4 aromatic protons of a para (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. The integration (2H+2H=4H) is correct.\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm, which is exactly what we expect for the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n    *   This option perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for **4-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the typical aromatic proton region (around 7-8 ppm). The chemical shifts and splitting patterns are inconsistent with a haloacetophenone. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   Similar to option C, this spectrum is missing the characteristic aromatic proton signals. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe structure that fits all the information provided is 4-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data in option B is the only one that corresponds to this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\n*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the information provided in the question.**\n    1.  **Molecular Formula information:** The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms. It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The aromatic ring itself (benzene) accounts for 6 carbon atoms (C6). Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 total C - 6 ring C = 2 C).\n    2.  **Functional Group information (from FTIR):**\n        *   A peak indicates a carbonyl group (C=O).\n        *   A peak indicates an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X, where X is a halogen like F, Cl, Br, or I).\n    3.  **Structural deductions:**\n        *   We have a benzene ring with two groups attached (di-substituted).\n        *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X) directly attached to the ring.\n        *   The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms: 2 carbons and 1 oxygen, including a C=O group. The most plausible and common group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n*   **Step 2: Propose the most likely structure.**\n    *   Combining the deductions from Step 1, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The molecular structure consists of a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom and one acetyl group.\n    *   The molecular formula is C8H7XO. This fits all the initial criteria.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR spectral features based on the proposed structure.**\n    *   The structure is a di-substituted benzene ring. This means there are 4 protons on the aromatic ring. The substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para) will determine the splitting pattern of these protons.\n    *   Let's examine the patterns in the options provided, specifically in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n        *   Options B and C show a pattern of `(2H, d)` and `(2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para isomer results in only two distinct types of aromatic protons, which split each other into doublets.\n    *   So, we can refine our proposed structure to be a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Predict the complete 1H NMR spectrum for para-haloacetophenone and compare it with the given options.**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are two sets of equivalent protons.\n        1.  The two protons ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group (-COCH3). These will be deshielded and appear further downfield.\n        2.  The two protons ortho to the halogen atom (-X).\n        *   These two sets split each other, giving two doublets. The integration will be 2H for each doublet. Their chemical shift will be in the range of ~7.5-8.0 ppm.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There is one methyl group (-CH3) from the acetyl substituent.\n        *   These three protons are equivalent.\n        *   They are attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons on it, so they will appear as a **singlet** (no splitting).\n        *   The integration will be 3H.\n        *   The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone (Ar-CO-CH3) is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** ~7.5-8.0 ppm (4H total, split into two doublets of 2H each) and ~2.1-2.6 ppm (3H, singlet).\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the predicted spectrum with the options.**\n    *   A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)\n        *   Incorrect. The chemical shifts are not in the aromatic region.\n    *   B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)\n        *   Incorrect. The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not a ketone. This would correspond to a different structure, and the multiplicities are inconsistent for that structure anyway.\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **This is a perfect match.** It shows the two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons of a para-substituted ring (`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`) and the singlet for the 3 methyl protons of the acetyl group at a characteristic chemical shift (`2.3 (3H, s)`).\n    *   D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)\n        *   Incorrect. The aromatic region is wrong (only 1H), and the other signals do not match.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\n*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the problem statement to deduce the compound's structural features.**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This means we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum... as well as an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the benzene ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\n*   **Step 2: Combine the structural features to propose candidate molecules.**\n    *   We have two substituents on a benzene ring: one is a halogen (-X), and the other must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   Let's figure out the C2 substituent with a carbonyl group. Two possibilities are most common:\n        1.  An **acetyl group** (-COCH3). This has two carbons and a carbonyl group. The resulting compound would be a **haloacetophenone**. The total formula is C8H7XO.\n        2.  A **(formylmethyl) group** (-CH2CHO). This also has two carbons and a carbonyl (aldehyde) group. The resulting compound would be a **halophenylacetaldehyde**. The total formula is C8H7XO.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR data options to determine the substitution pattern and identify the correct structure.**\n    *   The splitting patterns in the aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm) give clues about the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para). A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons (2H), is highly characteristic of a **para (1,4) substitution**. This symmetrical arrangement results in two distinct sets of equivalent protons on the ring. Both options A and D show this `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern, suggesting a para-substituted compound. Options B and C can be eliminated as they do not show appropriate signals for a di-substituted benzene ring.\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the remaining options (A and D) against the proposed structures.**\n\n    *   **Analyze Option D: 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: As identified, this fits a para-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   `δ 2.3 (3H, s)`: This signal is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) attached to a carbonyl, i.e., an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**. The chemical shift (around 2.1-2.5 ppm) is typical for this group. It is a singlet (s) because the adjacent carbonyl carbon has no protons, so there is no splitting.\n        *   **Conclusion for D**: This spectrum perfectly matches the structure of a **p-haloacetophenone** (e.g., 4-bromoacetophenone). This structure satisfies all the initial conditions: C8 total atoms, di-substituted aromatic, carbonyl group, and an Ar-X bond. The number of protons (2+2+3 = 7H) also matches the structure C6H4(COCH3)X. This is a very strong candidate.\n\n    *   **Analyze Option A: 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   `δ 9.9 (1H, s)`: A signal in the 9-10 ppm range is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**.\n        *   `δ 3.7 (2H, s)`: A signal around 3.7 ppm could correspond to a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aromatic ring and the carbonyl group.\n        *   **Conclusion for A**: This spectrum would correspond to a **p-halophenylacetaldehyde** structure (X-C6H4-CH2CHO). This structure also has C8, is di-substituted, has a carbonyl, and an Ar-X bond.\n        *   **Identifying the Flaw**: In a -CH2CHO group, the aldehyde proton is adjacent to the two methylene protons, and vice-versa. Due to spin-spin coupling, the aldehyde signal (-CHO) should be split by the -CH2- group into a **triplet (t)**, and the methylene signal (-CH2-) should be split by the -CHO proton into a **doublet (d)**. Option A incorrectly lists both of these signals as **singlets (s)**. This is chemically inconsistent.\n\n*   **Step 5: Final Decision**\n    *   Option D describes a chemically valid and consistent 1H NMR spectrum for p-haloacetophenone, a molecule that fits all the criteria given in the problem.\n    *   Option A describes a 1H NMR spectrum with incorrect splitting patterns for the proposed structure of p-halophenylacetaldehyde, making it an invalid representation.\n\nTherefore, the correct 1H NMR data is given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** A 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring), which accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. This means the two substituents on the benzene ring must contain a combined total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Substituents:** The ring is di-substituted.\n*   **FTIR Clues:**\n    *   A **carbonyl group (C=O)** is present.\n    *   An **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)** is present. This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I).\n\n**2. Deduce the Structure of the Substituents:**\n\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible structures for this C2-carbonyl substituent:\n    *   **Acetyl group:** -C(=O)CH₃. This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl.\n    *   **Formylmethyl group:** -CH₂CHO. This also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl.\n    *   Other possibilities like -CH₂COOH or -COOCH₃ exist, but they introduce a second oxygen atom which isn't specified (though not explicitly ruled out).\n\n**3. Determine Plausible Molecular Structures:**\n\nBased on the above, two main structural isomers are highly plausible:\n\n*   **Structure I (Ketone):** A halogen and an acetyl group on the benzene ring. The formula would be X-C₆H₄-C(=O)CH₃. This is a halo-acetophenone.\n*   **Structure II (Aldehyde):** A halogen and a formylmethyl group on the benzene ring. The formula would be X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO. This is a halo-phenylacetaldehyde.\n\nBoth structures have 8 carbons, a di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n**4. Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n\nLet's predict the NMR spectra for our plausible structures and compare them to the given options. We will pay close attention to the number of signals, their chemical shifts (δ), their integration (number of protons), and their splitting pattern (s, d, t, etc.).\n\nA key feature in options B and D is the pattern **δ 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d)**. This is a classic textbook pattern for a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring where the two substituents are electronically different. This simplifies our structural possibilities to 1-halo-4-acetylbenzene (Structure I, para) or 1-halo-4-(formylmethyl)benzene (Structure II, para).\n\n*   **Option A) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect. It only shows one aromatic proton, whereas a di-substituted benzene ring must have four.\n\n*   **Option C) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect. It shows no signals in the aromatic region (typically δ 6.5-8.5 ppm), which is impossible for a compound containing an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Option D) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d). This matches a para-disubstituted ring. The downfield shifts (7.6-7.8 ppm) indicate the ring is attached to electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** δ 2.3 (3H, s). This is a singlet for 3 protons, which is characteristic of a methyl (-CH₃) group that has no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Matching Structure:** This spectrum perfectly matches **Structure I (the ketone, 1-halo-4-acetylbenzene)**.\n        *   The two doublets are the four aromatic protons.\n        *   The singlet at ~2.3 ppm is the methyl of the acetyl group (-C(=O)**CH₃**). It's a singlet because the adjacent carbonyl carbon has no protons.\n        *   The chemical shift of ~2.3 ppm is typical for a methyl ketone. The downfield aromatic signals are also consistent with the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the acetyl group being directly attached to the ring.\n\n*   **Option B) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d). Also suggests a para-disubstituted ring.\n    *   **Low-field region:** δ 9.9 (1H, s). A signal at this chemical shift is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** δ 3.7 (2H, s). This is a singlet for 2 protons, likely a methylene (-CH₂-) group with no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Matching Structure:** This spectrum seems to describe **Structure II (the aldehyde, 1-halo-4-(formylmethyl)benzene)**.\n    *   **Inconsistency Check:** Let's look closer. In Structure II (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO), the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group is insulated from the ring by a CH₂ group. Its effect on the aromatic protons would be weaker than the direct attachment in the ketone. Therefore, the aromatic protons should be more shielded (at a lower ppm value) than in the ketone. Chemical shifts of 7.8 and 7.6 ppm are too far downfield (too deshielded) for this structure; values closer to 7.1-7.4 ppm would be expected. The spectrum in option D is far more consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe NMR data in Option D is highly consistent with the structure of a 4'-haloacetophenone (Structure I). The aromatic signals reflect a para-substituted ring with a strong electron-withdrawing group attached, and the 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm perfectly represents the methyl of the acetyl group. The data in Option B contains a significant inconsistency in the chemical shifts of the aromatic protons.\n\nTherefore, Option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\n*   **Step 1: Decode the information from the question.**\n    1.  **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached.\n    2.  **Molecular Formula:** A total of 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n    3.  **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n        *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n        *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the molecular structure.**\n    *   We have a benzene ring (C6).\n    *   One substituent is a halogen, -X (which has 0 carbons).\n    *   The other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The only common and stable arrangement for a C2 group with a carbonyl is an acetyl group: -C(=O)CH3.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The general formula is X-C6H4-COCH3.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 4 on the ring and 3 on the methyl group, for a total of 7 hydrogens. The 1H NMR spectrum should show a total integration of 7H.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum based on possible isomers (ortho, meta, para).**\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum will have signals for the aromatic protons (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) and the methyl protons of the acetyl group.\n    *   **Acetyl Group (-COCH3):** This group will always show up as a **singlet** (as there are no adjacent protons) with an integration of **3H**. The carbonyl group is deshielding, so the chemical shift will be around 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons on the ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern:\n        *   *ortho (1,2-substituted):* Would result in four distinct and complex signals (multiplets) in the aromatic region, each integrating to 1H.\n        *   *meta (1,3-substituted):* Would also result in four complex signals, though sometimes one might appear as a singlet if it's flanked by the two substituents. It's generally a complex pattern of four 1H signals.\n        *   *para (1,4-substituted):* Due to symmetry, there are only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons. This leads to a characteristic, simplified pattern: two **doublets**, each integrating to **2H**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the given NMR data options.**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The integrations (1H, 2H, 2H, 2H) sum to 7H, which is correct. However, it lacks a 3H singlet for the acetyl methyl group. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Integration:** 2H + 2H + 3H = 7H. Correct.\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). This pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, is the classic signature of a **para-substituted** benzene ring.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** 2.3 (3H, s). This is a singlet integrating to 3H, at a chemical shift perfect for the methyl group of an acetyl ketone (-COCH3).\n        *   This spectrum perfectly matches the expected data for **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. This would correspond to a structure like halo-phenylacetaldehyde. While this structure also has 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and an Ar-X bond, the protons of the -CH2-CHO group would couple with each other, resulting in a doublet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CHO, not two singlets. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum completely lacks signals in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), which is impossible for a compound containing a benzene ring. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B is the only one that correctly describes the 1H NMR spectrum of a di-substituted 8-carbon aromatic compound containing a carbonyl and an Ar-X bond, which is identified as a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information about the compound:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it is a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents.\n    *   **Molecular Formula Hint:** It contains 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must collectively contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n        *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n        *   An aromatic-halogen bond is present. This is most reliably interpreted as a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly bonded to one of the carbons of the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Propose a molecular structure:**\n    *   Let the benzene ring be represented as C6H4 (since it's di-substituted).\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   Possible C2 groups containing a carbonyl are:\n        *   `-COCH3` (acetyl group). This would form a halo-acetophenone.\n        *   `-CH2CHO` (formylmethyl group). This would form a halo-phenylacetaldehyde.\n        *   `-CH2COOH` (carboxymethyl group). This would form a halo-phenylacetic acid.\n        *   `-COOCH3` (methyl ester group). This would form a methyl halo-benzoate.\n\n3.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectra for the most likely structures and compare with the given options.** The options B and D both show a pattern of two doublets (2H each) in the 7-8 ppm region. This is a classic signature for a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring, where the symmetry results in two sets of equivalent protons. We will therefore focus on para-substituted isomers.\n\n    *   **Candidate 1: para-haloacetophenone** (Structure: X-C6H4-COCH3)\n        *   **Total Protons:** The formula is C8H7XO. There should be 4 aromatic protons + 3 methyl protons = 7 protons.\n        *   **Expected 1H NMR:**\n            *   Two doublets in the aromatic region (e.g., ~7.4-8.0 ppm) for the 4 aromatic protons.\n            *   A singlet for the methyl group (-CH3). Since this methyl group is attached to a carbonyl, it is deshielded and should appear around **2.5-2.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Comparison with Option D:** `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`.\n            *   This option matches the pattern (two doublets, one singlet) and the proton count (4+3=7).\n            *   However, the chemical shift of the singlet (2.3 ppm) is too low for an acetyl group's methyl protons (~2.6 ppm). This shift is more typical for a methyl group directly attached to the aromatic ring (a tolyl group). This makes Option D a poor match for this structure.\n\n    *   **Candidate 2: para-halophenylacetaldehyde** (Structure: X-C6H4-CH2CHO)\n        *   **Total Protons:** The formula is C8H7XO. There should be 4 aromatic protons + 2 methylene protons + 1 aldehyde proton = 7 protons.\n        *   **Expected 1H NMR:**\n            *   A signal for the aldehyde proton (-CHO). This is highly deshielded and should appear as a singlet or a triplet around **9-10 ppm**.\n            *   Two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons (~7.2-7.8 ppm).\n            *   A signal for the methylene protons (-CH2-). This group is adjacent to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl, so it should appear around **3.6-3.8 ppm**. It would typically be a doublet due to coupling with the aldehyde proton.\n        *   **Comparison with Option B:** `9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`.\n            *   **Proton Count:** 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7 protons. This is incorrect, the sum is 7 protons. Let's recheck the option in the prompt. B) `9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`. Ah, I see the integration error in my initial calculation, it should be 1+2+2+2 = 7H. Wait, let me recount the structure's protons: Ar(4H), CH2(2H), CHO(1H), total = 7H. The option integrations are 1H + 2H + 2H + 2H = 7H. OK, the proton count matches. Let's re-read the option. B) `1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`. Wait, it's a `2H` singlet, that's incorrect for a CH2. It must be `3.7 (2H, s)`. Let me assume it is a typo in my reasoning, not the option. I will re-examine the option itself: B) `1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`. Okay, a `2H singlet`. This makes sense for a `-CH2-` group with no adjacent protons.\n            *   The aldehyde proton signal at `9.9 ppm` is a perfect match.\n            *   The methylene proton signal at `3.7 ppm` is a perfect match.\n            *   The para-substituted aromatic pattern (two doublets) is present.\n            *   The structure `p-halophenylacetaldehyde` fits all the initial requirements (8C, di-substituted, C=O, Ar-X bond) and the chemical shifts in Option B are highly characteristic of it.\n            *   The only slight discrepancy is the multiplicity. We would expect coupling between the -CH2- and -CHO protons (a doublet and a triplet). However, it is common for this coupling to be absent or very small, resulting in two singlets, especially in idealized problems or under certain experimental conditions (e.g., exchange with trace acid/water).\n\n4.  **Evaluate other options:**\n    *   **A) & C):** These options lack signals in the typical aromatic region (7-8 ppm), which is inconsistent with having an aromatic ring. Therefore, they are incorrect.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Option D is a poor fit because the key methyl chemical shift is significantly different from the expected value for the only plausible structure.\n    *   Option B provides data where the chemical shifts of the characteristic aldehyde and methylene protons are an excellent match for the `para-halophenylacetaldehyde` structure. This structure, in turn, perfectly fits all the conditions described in the problem. The discrepancy in multiplicity is a plausible simplification.\n\nTherefore, Option B represents the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Compound Information:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituent groups attached (C₆H₄R₁R₂). A benzene ring itself contains 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: A carbonyl group is a C=O double bond. This must be part of one of the substituents.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, I) is directly attached to the benzene ring. So, one substituent is a halogen atom, let's denote it as -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   A group with 2 carbons and a C=O group is an acetyl group: -C(=O)CH₃.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Full Molecular Structure:**\n    *   The compound consists of a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom and one acetyl group. The general structure is haloacetophenone.\n    *   Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, there are three possible isomers:\n        *   **Ortho (1,2-substitution)**\n        *   **Meta (1,3-substitution)**\n        *   **Para (1,4-substitution)**\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Isomer:**\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum will show signals for the aromatic protons (on the ring) and the methyl protons (-CH₃) of the acetyl group.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The methyl group is attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, these 3 protons will appear as a **singlet (s)**, typically in the range of 2.0-2.6 ppm. This will be common to all three isomers.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C₆H₄):** This is the key to distinguishing the isomers.\n        *   **Para isomer (1,4-disubstituted):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. The 4 aromatic protons are in two sets of two equivalent protons. This results in a very characteristic pattern: **two doublets (d), each integrating to 2H**. One doublet will be for the protons next to the acetyl group, and the other for the protons next to the halogen. These signals typically appear between 7.0 and 8.0 ppm.\n        *   **Ortho (1,2) and Meta (1,3) isomers:** These molecules lack symmetry. All four aromatic protons are chemically non-equivalent. This results in a much more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, typically with four separate signals (e.g., multiplets, doublets of doublets, triplets of doublets), not two simple doublets of 2H intensity.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options against the Predictions:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic region:** `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)` - This is two doublets, each for two protons. This perfectly matches the pattern predicted for the **para isomer**. The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, so the protons adjacent to it are shifted furthest downfield (7.8 ppm).\n        *   **Aliphatic region:** `2.3 (3H, s)` - This is a singlet for three protons, matching the methyl of an acetyl group.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This spectrum is a perfect match for a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are not in the typical aromatic region (7-8 ppm). This spectrum does not correspond to the described compound.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   A signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a ketone (-COCH₃). This contradicts the structure we deduced.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   Similar to option B, this lacks the signals in the aromatic proton region (7-8 ppm). It is not the correct spectrum.\n\nBased on the analysis, only option A describes the 1H NMR spectrum that would be produced by the compound described in the question, which is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula core:** The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms. It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which accounts for 6 carbon atoms (C6). Therefore, the two substituents attached to the ring must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n        *   A **carbonyl group (C=O)** is present.\n        *   An **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)** is present. This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Propose a Structure:**\n    *   Based on the information above, one substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable chemical group fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The general formula is C8H7XO.\n    *   The problem states it's a di-substituted ring. The two substituents (-X and -COCH3) can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions. The 1H NMR spectrum will reveal this arrangement due to molecular symmetry.\n\n3.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the Proposed Structure (Haloacetophenone):**\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The acetyl group (-COCH3) has three protons on its methyl group. These protons are adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, they will not be split and will appear as a **singlet (s)**. Their chemical shift is typically in the range of δ 2.2-2.6 ppm due to the deshielding effect of the carbonyl group. This signal should integrate to **3H**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are 4 protons on the di-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   If the substitution is **ortho or meta**, the four aromatic protons are all chemically non-equivalent, which would lead to a complex spectrum with four distinct signals.\n        *   If the substitution is **para (1,4)**, the molecule has a high degree of symmetry. The two protons ortho to the acetyl group are equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen are also equivalent to each other. This results in a simple pattern: two signals, each integrating to **2H**. Each signal appears as a **doublet (d)** because each proton is split by its single adjacent proton neighbor. This characteristic `(2H, d)` and `(2H, d)` pattern in the δ 7-8 ppm range is a classic signature of para-substitution.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum does not show a 3H singlet for an acetyl group. It also only shows 1H in the aromatic region, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted ring. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum has no signals in the typical aromatic region (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm). An aromatic compound must show peaks in this region. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic region:** `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This is the classic, clean pattern for a **para-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n        *   **Alkyl region:** `2.3 (3H, s)`. This perfectly matches the signal for an **acetyl group's methyl protons** (a 3H singlet around 2.3 ppm).\n        *   This spectrum is an exact match for the predicted spectrum of **para-haloacetophenone**. It satisfies all conditions: C8, di-substituted aromatic, carbonyl group, aromatic-halogen bond (inferred from the structure that fits the NMR), and the correct NMR signals.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at **δ 9.9 ppm** is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**.\n        *   This means the carbonyl group is an aldehyde.\n        *   The aromatic pattern (`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`) suggests para-substitution.\n        *   A plausible structure with C8, a para-substituted ring, an aldehyde, and a halogen would be **4-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde (Ar-CH2-X)**. This structure has 8 carbons, and its NMR would indeed show two aromatic doublets, a singlet for the aldehyde proton, and a singlet for the CH2 protons.\n        *   **However, this structure contradicts the FTIR data.** In 4-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde, the halogen is on a benzylic carbon (C-X), not directly on the aromatic ring (Ar-X). The question explicitly states an \"aromatic-halogen bond\". Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Option C is the only one that is fully consistent with all the provided information. The compound is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Compound's Description:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This means we have a benzene ring (C6) with two groups attached to it. The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** Since the ring is 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR: carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl functional group.\n    *   **FTIR: aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** The other substituent is a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, or I) directly bonded to the benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure:**\n    *   We have two substituents to place on the benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This doesn't account for any of the remaining 2 carbons.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the 2 remaining carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable group that fits this description is the acetyl group: **-C(=O)CH₃**.\n    *   So, the compound is a **halogenoacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO. This structure has 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond, fulfilling all the conditions.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Isomers and their Expected 1H NMR Spectra:**\n    *   The two substituents (halogen and acetyl group) can be arranged in three ways on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n    *   **Common feature:** Regardless of the substitution pattern, the methyl group (-CH₃) of the acetyl substituent is isolated from other protons, so it will always appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its chemical shift should be around 2.0-2.6 ppm because it's adjacent to a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** The pattern of the 4 aromatic protons depends on the substitution.\n        *   **Ortho or Meta:** These isomers would give a complex set of signals (e.g., multiplets, doublets of doublets) for the 4 aromatic protons because they are all in different chemical environments.\n        *   **Para:** This isomer is symmetrical. The 4 aromatic protons are present as two pairs of equivalent protons. This symmetry results in a much simpler spectrum, typically seen as **two distinct doublets (d)**, with each doublet integrating to **2H**. This is a very characteristic pattern for 1,4-disubstitution.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** It shows two doublets, each for 2 protons. This `(2H, d)` and `(2H, d)` pattern is the hallmark of a **para-substituted** aromatic ring. The chemical shifts (7.6-7.8 ppm) are appropriate for an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** It shows a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches the methyl protons of an acetyl group `(-COCH₃)`.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This data perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for a para-halogenoacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum does not show the correct pattern for aromatic protons (expecting 4H total in the 6.5-8.5 ppm range). The signals are inconsistent with the described structure.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The `9.9 (1H, s)` peak is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a ketone. If the compound were an aldehyde (e.g., p-halomethylbenzaldehyde), the halogen would be on a methyl group (-CH₂X), not directly on the aromatic ring. This contradicts the \"aromatic-halogen bond\" information from the FTIR.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This option has no peaks in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). This is incorrect as the compound is described as aromatic.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Option A is the only choice that is fully consistent with all the information provided. The structure is a para-substituted halogenoacetophenone, which has 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, an aromatic-halogen bond, and produces a 1H NMR spectrum with two doublets in the aromatic region and a 3H singlet for the methyl ketone.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound and its 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula Core:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring, C6H4) and a total of 8 carbon atoms. This means the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n        *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n        *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present.\n    *   **Putting it together:** The compound is a halobenzene with a second substituent that contains two carbons and a carbonyl group. The halogen atom (-X, e.g., -Cl, -Br) is one substituent. The other substituent must have the formula C2HnO.\n\n2.  **Identify Possible Structures for the Second Substituent:**\n    The second substituent has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The most common and stable chemical groups that fit this description are:\n    *   **Acetyl group:** -C(=O)CH3. This fits the criteria perfectly.\n    *   **Formylmethyl group:** -CH2CHO. This also fits the criteria.\n    *   **Methoxycarbonyl (ester):** -COOCH3. This also fits.\n    *   **Carboxymethyl group:** -CH2COOH. This fits, but the acidic proton has a very characteristic broad signal, usually >10 ppm.\n\n3.  **Combine the Substituents and Ring to Form Possible Isomers:**\n    Let's focus on the most likely candidate from a chemical stability and commonality standpoint, the acetyl group.\n    *   **Structure based on Acetyl Group:** The compound would be a **haloacetophenone**. With one halogen and one acetyl group, the total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. This matches the description. The general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3.\n    *   The substitution can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n\n4.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Options in the Context of a Haloacetophenone Structure:**\n    A haloacetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3) has:\n    *   4 aromatic protons on the benzene ring.\n    *   3 protons from the methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   Total protons = 7.\n\n    Now, let's examine the patterns expected from the isomers and compare them with the given options.\n    *   **Para-substitution (1,4-isomer):** This typically gives a very distinct pattern in the aromatic region: two doublets, each integrating to 2H. The methyl group (-CH3) is attached to a carbonyl, so it has no adjacent protons and will appear as a singlet integrating to 3H.\n    *   **Ortho/Meta-substitution:** These would give more complex patterns for the 4 aromatic protons, not two clean doublets.\n\n    Let's look at the options provided:\n    *   A) `6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)`: The proton count and splitting patterns are inconsistent with any simple haloacetophenone isomer. Incorrect.\n    *   B) `4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)`: This spectrum has no signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). This is impossible for a compound with an aromatic ring. Incorrect.\n    *   C) `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`:\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)` is the classic pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring with two different substituents. It integrates to 4H.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** `2.3 (3H, s)` is a singlet integrating to 3 protons, which perfectly matches the methyl group of an acetyl (-COCH3) substituent.\n        *   **Overall:** This spectrum is an excellent match for a **p-haloacetophenone**. The acetyl group (-COCH3) and the halogen (-X) are both electron-withdrawing groups, which deshield the aromatic protons, pushing their chemical shifts downfield to the observed 7.6-7.8 ppm range. This option is a very strong candidate.\n\n    *   D) `9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`:\n        *   This spectrum suggests a different structure. The `9.9 (1H, s)` peak is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The `3.7 (2H, s)` peak suggests a methylene (-CH2-) group next to an electron-withdrawing group but with no adjacent protons. This matches the formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO). The aromatic pattern is again for para-substitution. So this would be **p-halo-(phenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n        *   **Consistency Check:** The problem with this option is the chemical shift of the aromatic protons. A -CH2CHO group is only weakly electron-withdrawing because the C=O group is not directly conjugated with the ring. Therefore, the aromatic protons would be expected at a much higher field (further upfield, lower ppm), typically around 7.2-7.4 ppm. The value of 7.6-7.8 ppm is too far downfield and inconsistent with this structure.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The NMR data in option C is the only one that is fully consistent with a structure that meets all the criteria given in the problem. The compound is a p-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **Structure:** p-haloacetophenone (e.g., 4'-Bromoacetophenone).\n    *   **Carbons:** 8 carbons (6 ring + 2 acetyl). Correct.\n    *   **FTIR:** Contains C=O and Ar-X. Correct.\n    *   **1H NMR:** A para-substituted aromatic pattern (two doublets, 4H total) and a methyl singlet (3H). The chemical shifts in the aromatic region (7.6-7.8 ppm) are consistent with the strong deshielding effect of a conjugated carbonyl group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: The core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR ... carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **\"FTIR ... aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring. A halogen atom contains zero carbon atoms.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   We have established one substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must account for the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   There are two primary possibilities for a two-carbon, carbonyl-containing group:\n        1.  An acetyl group: -COCH3\n        2.  A formylmethyl group: -CH2CHO\n\n3.  **Propose Possible Molecular Structures:**\n    *   Based on the above, the compound could be a haloacetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3) or a halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n    *   The problem does not specify the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n\n4.  **Analyze Predicted 1H NMR Spectra for Each Structure:**\n\n    *   **Case 1: Haloacetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3)**\n        *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4)**: There are 4 protons on the ring. Their pattern will depend on the substitution (ortho, meta, para). A para (1,4) substitution is common and gives a highly symmetric pattern: two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, typically in the 7-8 ppm range.\n        *   **Methyl Protons (-COCH3)**: There are 3 protons. Since they are attached to a carbonyl carbon (which has no protons), they will appear as a sharp **singlet**. The chemical shift for a methyl ketone is typically around **2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO)**\n        *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4)**: Similar to the first case, 4 protons on the ring.\n        *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO)**: There is 1 proton. Aldehyde protons are highly deshielded and appear far downfield, typically between **9-10 ppm**. This proton is adjacent to the -CH2- group, so it should be split into a **triplet**.\n        *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-)**: There are 2 protons. They are adjacent to the aldehyde proton, so they should be split into a **doublet**. Their chemical shift would be around **3.5-4.5 ppm**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given NMR Options against the Predictions:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   This option has an aldehyde-like proton at 9.9 ppm and methylene-like protons at 3.7 ppm. This matches the chemical shifts for the halophenylacetaldehyde structure.\n        *   However, the splitting is incorrect. The aldehyde proton is listed as a singlet (`s`), not a triplet (`t`), and the methylene protons are listed as a singlet (`s`), not a doublet (`d`). This indicates a lack of coupling, which is very unlikely. The pattern in the aromatic region (two doublets) suggests para-substitution.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This data does not show signals in the typical aromatic (7-8 ppm), aldehyde (9-10 ppm), or ketone (2.1-2.6 ppm) regions. It is inconsistent with the proposed structures.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This data lacks any signals in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), which is a requirement for the described compound.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d)**: This pattern is the classic signature of a **para-substituted** benzene ring.\n        *   **2.3 (3H, s)**: This is a perfect match for the methyl protons of an acetyl group (-COCH3). The chemical shift (2.3 ppm), integration (3H), and splitting (singlet) are all correct.\n        *   This spectrum perfectly matches the structure of a **para-haloacetophenone (p-X-C6H4-COCH3)**. This structure fulfills all initial conditions: a di-substituted aromatic ring, 8 total carbons, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The data in option D is the only one that perfectly and unambiguously matches a structure that fits all the information given in the problem. The structure is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Compound's Molecular Formula and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Total Carbons:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Core Structure:** It has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C6).\n    *   **Substituents:** Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the substituents must contain the remaining 2 carbons (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **FTIR Information:**\n        *   A **carbonyl group (C=O)** is present.\n        *   An **aromatic-halogen bond** is present. This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring with two substituents.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The most common and stable functional group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**.\n\n3.  **Consider Isomerism and its effect on 1H NMR:**\n    *   The two substituents (halogen and acetyl group) can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: *ortho* (1,2-), *meta* (1,3-), or *para* (1,4-).\n    *   The symmetry of the isomer determines the appearance of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n        *   ***ortho* and *meta* isomers:** These are unsymmetrical. They would have 4 distinct protons on the aromatic ring, leading to a complex spectrum with four different signals (though some might overlap).\n        *   ***para* isomer:** This isomer has a plane of symmetry passing through the two substituents. This symmetry makes the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 equivalent. This results in a much simpler spectrum.\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the *para* Isomer (e.g., 4-chloroacetophenone):**\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):**\n        *   There are 3 equivalent protons in the methyl group.\n        *   They are adjacent to a carbonyl group, which deshields them. Their chemical shift should be in the range of **2.0-2.5 ppm**.\n        *   They are not adjacent to any other protons, so their signal will be a **singlet (s)**.\n        *   The integration will be **3H**.\n        *   Predicted signal: **~2.3 ppm (3H, s)**.\n\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:**\n        *   The aromatic region (usually 6.5-8.5 ppm) will contain signals for the 4 protons on the ring.\n        *   Due to the *para* symmetry, there are two sets of equivalent protons.\n        *   **Protons ortho to the acetyl group:** These are the two protons closer to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group. They will be the most deshielded (highest chemical shift). They are a set of 2 equivalent protons, and each is split by its single neighbor, resulting in a **doublet (d)**. Integration: **2H**. Predicted signal: **~7.8-8.0 ppm (2H, d)**.\n        *   **Protons ortho to the halogen group:** These are the other two protons. They are also deshielded but generally less so than the ones next to the acetyl group. They are also a set of 2 equivalent protons, each split by its single neighbor, resulting in a **doublet (d)**. Integration: **2H**. Predicted signal: **~7.5-7.7 ppm (2H, d)**.\n\n5.  **Compare the Prediction with the Given Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: Perfectly matches the prediction for the acetyl methyl group.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: Perfectly matches the prediction for the two sets of protons on a *para*-substituted benzene ring.

This data does not fit the structure for multiple reasons, including wrong chemical shifts for aromatic protons and incorrect integration values.\n\nConclusion: The data in option A perfectly describes a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Molecular Formula and Features from the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C₆) with two substituents attached. A di-substituted benzene ring has the formula C₆H₄.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum...indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum...indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\n**2. Assembling the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   We have a benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group (C=O). Let's deduce the structure of this C₂-carbonyl substituent.\n    *   **Possibility 1: Acetyl group, -C(=O)CH₃.** This group has two carbons and a carbonyl. The resulting molecule is a haloacetophenone: X-C₆H₄-C(=O)CH₃. The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 1 (carbonyl C) + 1 (methyl C) = 8. This fits all the criteria.\n    *   **Possibility 2: A -CH₂CHO group.** This group also has two carbons and a carbonyl. The resulting molecule is a (halophenyl)acetaldehyde: X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO. The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 1 (CH₂ C) + 1 (CHO C) = 8. This also fits all the criteria.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Provided 1H NMR Options**\n\nNow, we need to determine which of the possible structures matches one of the given NMR spectra. A key feature to look for in the spectra is the pattern in the aromatic region. For a para-disubstituted ring (which is highly symmetrical), we expect to see a distinct pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H. For ortho or meta substitution, the pattern would be more complex.\n\n*   **Option B and D:** These can be immediately eliminated because they do not show signals in the typical aromatic region (usually 6.5-8.5 ppm) that would account for the 4 protons on a di-substituted benzene ring.\n*   **Option A: 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum corresponds to the (halophenyl)acetaldehyde structure (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n    *   `δ 9.9 (1H, s)`: A sharp singlet very far downfield is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n    *   `δ 3.7 (2H, s)`: A signal in this region for 2 protons fits a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group (a benzylic, α-carbonyl position). The singlet multiplicity means it is not observably coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n    *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern indicates a para (1,4) substitution on the benzene ring.\n*   **Option C: 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum corresponds to the haloacetophenone structure (X-C₆H₄-C(=O)CH₃).\n    *   `δ 2.3 (3H, s)`: A singlet for 3 protons around 2.1-2.6 ppm is the classic signature of a methyl ketone (-COCH₃).\n    *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern again indicates para (1,4) substitution.\n\n**4. Differentiating Between Option A and C using Chemical Shift Theory**\n\nBoth options A and C seem plausible as they describe molecules that fit the initial criteria and exhibit para-substitution patterns. The decision must be made by looking closer at the chemical shifts. The aromatic chemical shifts in both options are identical (7.8 and 7.6 ppm). We need to determine for which structure these shifts are more realistic.\n\n*   The electronic effect of the substituent determines the chemical shift of the aromatic protons. Both -COCH₃ and -CH₂CHO are electron-withdrawing groups, which deshield the ring protons and shift them downfield.\n*   However, the acetyl group (-COCH₃) is a much stronger electron-withdrawing group than the -CH₂CHO group because its carbonyl is directly conjugated with the aromatic ring (a powerful -R resonance effect).\n*   The -CH₂CHO group's carbonyl is insulated from the ring by a CH₂ group, so it can only exert a weaker, inductive (-I) effect.\n*   Therefore, the aromatic protons of **p-haloacetophenone** (structure for C) should be significantly more downfield (higher ppm) than those of **p-(halophenyl)acetaldehyde** (structure for A).\n\nLet's verify this by checking typical literature values.\n*   **For p-haloacetophenone** (e.g., p-bromoacetophenone), the aromatic signals are indeed found around **7.6-7.9 ppm**. This matches the data in option C.\n*   **For p-(halophenyl)acetaldehyde** (e.g., p-bromophenylacetaldehyde), the aromatic signals are found at much higher fields (lower ppm), typically around **7.1-7.5 ppm**.\n\nThe aromatic shifts given in Option A (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) are inconsistent with the (halophenyl)acetaldehyde structure it represents. These shifts are far too downfield. In contrast, the data in Option C is entirely consistent with a p-haloacetophenone structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is a p-haloacetophenone. Its 1H NMR spectrum would show two doublets in the aromatic region for the 4 aromatic protons and a singlet for the 3 methyl protons. Option C accurately describes this.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**Step 1: Deduce the molecular structure from the given information.**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents attached.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum...indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O)\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **\"as well as an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)\"**: One substituent is a halogen (e.g., F, Cl, Br, I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n\nCombining these facts, we can determine the two substituents:\n1.  A halogen atom (-X).\n2.  A second substituent that contains both the carbonyl group and all 2 remaining carbon atoms. The most common and simple structure for a two-carbon substituent with a carbonyl group is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\nTherefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the possible substitution patterns and their expected 1H NMR spectra.**\n\nA haloacetophenone has 4 protons on the aromatic ring and 3 protons on the methyl group of the acetyl substituent. The total number of protons is 7.\n\nThe substitution pattern can be ortho, meta, or para. Let's consider how the aromatic protons would appear in the 1H NMR spectrum for each isomer:\n*   **Ortho-isomer (1,2-disubstituted)**: The four aromatic protons are all in different chemical environments. This would lead to a complex pattern with four distinct signals (multiplets), not simple doublets.\n*   **Meta-isomer (1,3-disubstituted)**: This would also result in a complex pattern for the four aromatic protons. We would not expect to see two simple doublets.\n*   **Para-isomer (1,4-disubstituted)**: This isomer has a plane of symmetry passing through the two substituents.\n    *   The two protons next to (ortho to) the acetyl group are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The two protons next to (ortho to) the halogen are also chemically equivalent.\n    *   These two sets of protons couple with each other, resulting in a characteristic pattern of **two doublets**, each integrating to **2H**.\n    *   The acetyl group's methyl protons (-CH₃) have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **singlet**, integrating to **3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl ketone is typically around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the predicted spectrum with the given options.**\n\n*   **Predicted spectrum for p-haloacetophenone**:\n    *   ~7.5-8.0 ppm: Aromatic region showing two doublets, each for 2H.\n    *   ~2.1-2.6 ppm: A singlet for 3H.\n    *   Total protons: 2H + 2H + 3H = 7H.\n\n*   **Analyzing the options:**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This option shows two doublets (d) in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. This is the classic signature of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   It also shows a singlet (s) integrating to 3H at 2.3 ppm, which is perfect for an acetyl methyl group.\n        *   This data is an excellent match for p-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. The structure would have to be p-halophenylacetaldehyde. However, for that structure, the methylene protons (-CH₂-) at ~3.7 ppm would be a doublet (split by the aldehyde proton), and the aldehyde proton would be a triplet (split by the methylene protons). The option incorrectly lists both as singlets.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts ~4.6-4.8 ppm are too low for protons on an aromatic ring. This does not fit the described compound.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The integration and splitting patterns for the aromatic protons (should be 4H total, not 1H) are incorrect. The chemical shifts are also not characteristic of the proposed structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the only option that correctly represents the 1H NMR spectrum of a di-substituted aromatic compound with 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and a halogen (specifically, p-haloacetophenone) is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\n**1. Deconstruction of the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups**\n\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms (C8).\n*   **Core Structure:** It has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we have a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents.\n*   **FTIR Information:**\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Putting it together:**\n    *   The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X).\n    *   This leaves 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms for the second substituent.\n    *   This second substituent must also contain the carbonyl group.\n\n**2. Identifying Candidate Structures**\n\nWe need to find a 2-carbon group that contains a carbonyl. The two most common and stable possibilities are:\n*   **An acetyl group:** -COCH3. If this group is attached to the halo-benzene ring, the structure is **haloacetophenone** (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n*   **An acetic acid group attached via its methylene carbon:** -CH2COOH. If this group is attached to the halo-benzene ring, the structure is **(halophenyl)acetic acid** (X-C6H4-CH2COOH).\n\nBoth of these structures fit all the initial criteria:\n*   Di-substituted aromatic ring: Yes.\n*   8 Carbon atoms: Yes (6 in ring + 2 in substituent).\n*   Carbonyl group: Yes (ketone or carboxylic acid).\n*   Aromatic-halogen bond: Yes.\n\n**3. Analyzing the ¹H NMR Data Options**\n\nThe splitting pattern of the aromatic protons in an NMR spectrum is highly indicative of the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para). The options showing two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a **para (1,4) substitution pattern**. This symmetrical pattern gives a clean A₂B₂ (or AA'BB') spectrum, which appears as two distinct doublets. Options A and D show this pattern. Options B and C can be eliminated as they don't show the correct signals for a di-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Option B:** No signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). Incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** Shows only one aromatic proton. A di-substituted ring must have four aromatic protons. Incorrect.\n\nNow we must choose between Option A and Option D, which both suggest a para-substituted ring. We will match them to our candidate structures.\n\n**4. Evaluating Option A vs. Candidate Structures**\n\n*   **Option A:** ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)\n*   The signals at **7.8 ppm (2H, d)** and **7.6 ppm (2H, d)** confirm the para-substituted aromatic ring.\n*   The signal at **3.7 ppm (2H, s)** corresponds to a -CH₂- group with no adjacent protons. This matches the -CH₂- group in (4-halophenyl)acetic acid, `X-C₆H₄-CH₂COOH`.\n*   The signal at **9.9 ppm (1H, s)** would then have to be the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). While carboxylic acid protons are singlets, their chemical shift is typically in the 10-13 ppm range. A value of 9.9 ppm is unusually low. Also, chemical shifts of 7.6-7.8 ppm are quite downfield for the aromatic protons of a phenylacetic acid derivative (which are typically around 7.2-7.4 ppm). Therefore, this data is not a good match for (4-halophenyl)acetic acid.\n*   Alternatively, 9.9 ppm is a classic chemical shift for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This would suggest the structure (4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde (`X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO`). However, in this structure, the aldehyde proton (-CHO) is adjacent to the methylene protons (-CH₂-), and they would couple with each other. The spectrum should show a triplet for the -CHO proton and a doublet for the -CH₂- protons, not two singlets.\n*   Conclusion: Option A does not accurately represent a plausible structure that fits all the criteria.\n\n**5. Evaluating Option D vs. Candidate Structures**\n\n*   **Option D:** ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)\n*   The signals at **7.8 ppm (2H, d)** and **7.6 ppm (2H, d)** again confirm a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n*   The signal at **2.3 ppm (3H, s)** is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a carbonyl group (a methyl ketone).\n*   Let's check if this data matches our candidate structure, **4-haloacetophenone** (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃).\n    *   **Structure:** Has a para-substituted ring, which would give two doublets. Matches.\n    *   **Protons:** It has 4 aromatic protons and 3 methyl protons. The integrations (2H, 2H, 3H) match this.\n    *   **Splitting:** The methyl group is not adjacent to any protons, so it should be a singlet. Matches.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** For ketones, the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group deshields the ortho protons (closer to the group), shifting them downfield. The aromatic signals at 7.6 and 7.8 ppm are very reasonable. A methyl ketone singlet typically appears around 2.1-2.6 ppm, so 2.3 ppm is a perfect fit.\n*   Conclusion: The NMR data in Option D is an excellent match for a 4-haloacetophenone (e.g., 4-bromoacetophenone or 4-iodoacetophenone), which fulfills all the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\nFinal comparison confirms that Option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\":** This indicates a benzene ring with two groups attached. The general formula is C₆H₄XY.\n*   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\":** The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents (X and Y) must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... carbonyl group\":** This confirms the presence of a C=O double bond in one of the substituents.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... aromatic-halogen bond\":** This confirms that one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring. Let's call this substituent -X.\n\n**2. Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n\n*   We have one halogen substituent, -X.\n*   The second substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable substituent fitting this description is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   Let's check the carbon count: C₆ (ring) + C₂ (acetyl group) = C₈. This matches the total carbon count.\n*   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**.\n\n*Alternative Structure Check:* Another possibility for the C₂ + carbonyl substituent could be -CH₂CHO. This would make the molecule a halophenylacetaldehyde. We will keep this in mind as we analyze the NMR data.\n\n**3. Analyze the Substitution Pattern based on NMR Data:**\n\nLet's examine the aromatic region of the NMR spectra provided in the options.\n\n*   Options A and D both show a pattern of `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern, consisting of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para isomer makes the two protons on one side of the ring chemically equivalent to each other, and the same for the two protons on the other side. This results in the simple \"doublet of doublets\" pattern.\n*   Ortho (1,2) or meta (1,3) substitution would lead to more complex spectra with four distinct signals in the aromatic region, which is not observed in options A or D.\n*   Options B and C can be eliminated. Option B shows no aromatic protons. Option C's aromatic region (`6.9 (1H, s)`) is inconsistent with a disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nSo, the compound must be a **p-haloacetophenone** or a **p-halophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**4. Differentiate Between the Two Possible Structures using Full NMR Data:**\n\n*   **Structure 1: p-haloacetophenone** (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃)\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** Two doublets, 4H total. (Matches A & D)\n    *   **Acetyl group protons (-COCH₃):** A methyl group next to a carbonyl with no adjacent protons. This should appear as a **singlet integrating to 3H**, typically in the range of 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n*   **Structure 2: p-halophenylacetaldehyde** (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** Two doublets, 4H total. (Matches A & D)\n    *   **Aldehyde proton (-CHO):** Very deshielded, typically 9-10 ppm. It is adjacent to the -CH₂- group, so it should be a **triplet**.\n    *   **Methylene protons (-CH₂-):** Benzylic and adjacent to a carbonyl, typically 3.5-4.0 ppm. It is adjacent to the -CHO proton, so it should be a **doublet**.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Final Options (A and D):**\n\n*   **Option D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches the expectation for **p-haloacetophenone**.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: The para-substituted aromatic ring.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: The singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group. The chemical shift, integration, and splitting are all correct.\n\n*   **Option A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum attempts to describe p-halophenylacetaldehyde due to the aldehyde peak at 9.9 ppm.\n    *   However, there is a critical error in the splitting pattern. The aldehyde proton at 9.9 ppm and the methylene protons at 3.7 ppm should be a triplet and a doublet, respectively, due to mutual coupling. They are incorrectly listed as **singlets (s)**.\n    *   Furthermore, the aromatic signals at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm are more deshielded than what would be expected for a ring attached to a -CH₂CHO group; they are more consistent with the strong electron-withdrawing effect of a directly attached acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe data in Option D is a perfect match for p-haloacetophenone, which fulfills all the criteria described in the question. The data in Option A contains significant inconsistencies.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Decipher the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituent groups attached to it.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms. This means the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR ... presence of a carbonyl group (C=O)\"**: One of the substituents contains a carbonyl group.\n*   **\"FTIR ... presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, I) attached directly to the aromatic ring. Let's denote this as -X.\n\nNow let's combine these facts to build the structure:\n*   We have a halogen (-X) on the ring.\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. Possible structures for this second substituent are:\n    *   An acetyl group: -C(=O)CH₃. This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl. This fits.\n    *   A formylmethyl group: -CH₂CHO. This also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl. This also fits.\n    *   An ester like methoxycarbonyl: -COOCH₃. This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl. This also fits.\n\nSo, the potential molecules are a halo-acetophenone (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃), a halophenyl-acetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO), or a methyl halo-benzoate (X-C₆H₄-COOCH₃).\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data Options**\n\nLet's focus on the signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5 - 8.5 ppm) first.\n\n*   **Option A**: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)\n*   **Option B**: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)\n*   **Option C**: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d) - The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the aromatic region. This option is incorrect.\n*   **Option D**: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d) - There are no signals in the aromatic region. This option is incorrect.\n\nBoth options A and B show a pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons. This is the classic signature of a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring. In this arrangement, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, resulting in only two types of aromatic protons, which split each other into doublets.\n\nSo, we know our compound has the structure `para-X-C₆H₄-R`.\n\n**3. Evaluate Options A and B against the Possible Structures**\n\n*   **Structure 1: para-haloacetophenone (p-X-C₆H₄-COCH₃)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: We expect two doublets, each for 2H. This matches both A and B. Both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing, which would shift the aromatic protons downfield (to higher ppm values), consistent with the ~7.6-7.8 ppm shifts.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons**: We have a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a carbonyl. This group is isolated from other protons, so it should appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift is around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n\n*   **Structure 2: para-halophenylacetaldehyde (p-X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: We expect two doublets, each for 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons**: We have two sets of protons:\n        *   An aldehyde proton (-CHO): This is highly deshielded, appears far downfield (~9.5-10 ppm), and should be a **triplet (t)** due to splitting by the adjacent -CH₂ group. It integrates to **1H**.\n        *   A methylene group (-CH₂-): This appears around ~3.5-4.0 ppm and should be a **doublet (d)** due to splitting by the -CHO proton. It integrates to **2H**.\n\n**4. Match the NMR Data to the Best Structure**\n\nLet's re-examine options A and B:\n\n*   **Option A) `1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`**\n    *   This data seems to describe the aldehyde structure (`p-X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO`). The 9.9 ppm signal matches the aldehyde proton, and the 3.7 ppm signal matches the methylene group.\n    *   **However, there are two major problems:**\n        1.  **Multiplicity**: Both the aldehyde proton and the methylene protons are listed as singlets (`s`). They are adjacent and must split each other, so they should be a triplet and a doublet, respectively.\n        2.  **Aromatic Shift**: The aromatic shifts (7.6-7.8 ppm) are too high (too downfield) for a molecule with a -CH₂CHO group. This group is not strongly electron-withdrawing enough to cause such a large shift.\n\n*   **Option B) `1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`**\n    *   This data perfectly matches the ketone structure (`p-X-C₆H₄-COCH₃`).\n    *   The `2.3 (3H, s)` signal is exactly what we expect for the methyl protons of an acetyl group (-COCH₃): a singlet for 3 protons at ~2.3 ppm.\n    *   The `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` signals are consistent with a para-substituted ring containing a strongly electron-withdrawing acetyl group, which deshields the protons and shifts them downfield.\n    *   The integration (2H + 2H + 3H = 7 total protons) and multiplicities are all chemically correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is a para-haloacetophenone. Option B provides the 1H NMR data that is fully consistent with this structure in terms of chemical shifts, integration, and multiplicity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Structure from the Clues:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two groups attached to it (C6H4). A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The entire molecule has 8 carbons. Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of ... an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (like -F, -Cl, -Br, -I) directly attached to the benzene ring. Let's call it -X.\n\n**2. Identify the Substituents:**\n\n*   One substituent is a halogen, -X. This substituent does not contain any carbon atoms.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   A two-carbon group containing a carbonyl can be:\n    *   An **acetyl group** (-COCH3). This is a ketone.\n    *   A **formylmethyl group** (-CH2CHO). This is an aldehyde.\n\n**3. Propose Possible Molecular Structures:**\n\nBased on the above, two main structures fit all the initial criteria:\n*   **Structure I: Haloacetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3)**. Example: 4-chloroacetophenone.\n*   **Structure II: Halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO)**. Example: 4-chlorophenylacetaldehyde.\n\nBoth structures have 8 carbons, a di-substituted benzene ring, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n**4. Predict the 1H NMR Spectra for the Proposed Structures:**\n\nTo simplify the analysis, we'll assume the most symmetric isomer, the **para (1,4)-substituted** form, which typically gives a clean spectrum with two doublets in the aromatic region.\n\n*   **Prediction for Structure I (para-Haloacetophenone):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H)**: The aromatic ring is directly attached to an electron-withdrawing carbonyl group (-COCH3) and a halogen (-X). This will significantly de-shield (shift downfield) the aromatic protons. We expect signals in the range of **7.5-8.0 ppm**. For a para-isomer, this will appear as two doublets, each integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H)**: The protons of the -CH3 group next to a carbonyl typically appear as a singlet in the range of **2.0-2.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Summary:** 4H (2 doublets, ~7.5-8.0 ppm) and 3H (singlet, ~2.0-2.5 ppm).\n\n*   **Prediction for Structure II (para-Halophenylacetaldehyde):**\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (1H)**: The -CHO proton is highly characteristic and appears as a singlet (or narrow triplet) far downfield, typically in the range of **9.5-10.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (2H)**: The -CH2- protons are situated between the aromatic ring and the aldehyde group. They would appear around **3.5-4.0 ppm**. It would likely be a singlet or a small doublet (due to coupling with the aldehyde proton).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H)**: The ring is attached to a -CH2CHO group. The insulating -CH2- group means the electron-withdrawing effect of the distant carbonyl on the ring is much weaker than in Structure I. The aromatic signals would be less de-shielded, appearing closer to the range for alkylbenzenes, perhaps **7.1-7.4 ppm**. Again, we expect two doublets for a para-isomer.\n    *   **Summary:** 1H (singlet, ~9.5-10 ppm), 2H (singlet, ~3.5-4.0 ppm), 4H (2 doublets, ~7.1-7.4 ppm).\n\n**5. Evaluate the Given Options against Predictions:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**: Does not match either prediction. The integrations and splitting patterns are inconsistent with either proposed structure.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**: Incorrect. There are no signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm).\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**: This spectrum has the signals for an aldehyde (9.9 ppm) and methylene group (3.7 ppm), matching the functional groups of Structure II (Halophenylacetaldehyde). However, the aromatic signals (7.6 and 7.8 ppm) are far too downfield (de-shielded) for this structure. They are in the range expected for a system with a *directly conjugated* withdrawing group, like Structure I. Thus, this spectrum is internally inconsistent.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**: This spectrum is a perfect match for our prediction for **Structure I (para-Haloacetophenone)**.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Two doublets in the downfield aromatic region, characteristic of a para-substituted ring attached to an electron-withdrawing group.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: A singlet for 3 protons in the characteristic region for an acetyl methyl group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound that satisfies all the initial conditions and provides a chemically consistent 1H NMR spectrum is a para-haloacetophenone. The data in option D perfectly represents the spectrum for this compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Compound Information:**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means it's a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two groups attached. A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The molecule contains 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A **carbonyl group (C=O)** is present.\n    *   An **aromatic-halogen bond** is present. This is a crucial piece of information meaning a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring. This halogen is one of the two substituents.\n\n**2. Deduce the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   Based on the information, one substituent is a halogen (-X). A halogen atom has 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   A chemical group with 2 carbons and a carbonyl group is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   Combining these pieces, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The general structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n*   Let's check this proposed structure:\n    *   It has 8 carbon atoms (6 in the ring + 2 in the acetyl group). Correct.\n    *   It is a di-substituted aromatic ring. Correct.\n    *   It has a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Correct.\n*   The number of protons in this molecule (C₈H₇XO) would be 4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group, for a total of 7 protons.\n\n**3. Analyze Isomerism and Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\nThe substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para) significantly affects the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Para-isomer (1,4-disubstitution):** This is the most symmetrical arrangement. The plane of symmetry through the two substituents makes the aromatic protons chemically equivalent in two pairs. This results in a very clean and characteristic NMR pattern for the aromatic region: **two doublets**, each integrating to **2H**.\n*   **Ortho (1,2) and Meta (1,3) isomers:** These are less symmetrical and would result in more complex patterns in the aromatic region, typically with four distinct signals.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** The three methyl protons are adjacent to a carbonyl carbon (which has no protons), so they do not get split. They will appear as a **singlet** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift is deshielded by the carbonyl group to about 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options against the Prediction:**\n\nWe will look for a spectrum that matches the prediction for a haloacetophenone. Given the simplicity of the options, we should focus on the para-isomer prediction.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect. The signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are not in the typical aromatic proton region (> 6.5 ppm), and a di-substituted ring must have 4 aromatic protons, not 1.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The two signals `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` are a classic signature for a **para-substituted** aromatic ring. The chemical shifts are downfield, which is consistent with two electron-withdrawing groups attached to the ring.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** The signal `2.3 (3H, s)` is a singlet for 3 protons, which perfectly matches the signal for an acetyl group's methyl protons.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This spectrum is an excellent match for a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect. The signal at `9.9 ppm` is characteristic of an **aldehyde** (-CHO), not a ketone (-COCH₃). While a related structure, p-halophenylacetaldehyde, exists, this NMR data is internally inconsistent: the aldehyde and methylene protons would be expected to show coupling (triplet and doublet, respectively), not be singlets. Furthermore, the aromatic proton shifts are too far downfield for such a structure.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect.

Deconstruct the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring with two groups attached (C6H4XY).\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents (X and Y) must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Data:**\n    *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present.\n\n**2. Deduce the Possible Chemical Structure**\n\n*   From the FTIR data, we know one substituent (let's say X) is a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, or -I). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent (Y) must contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible C2 substituents containing a carbonyl group:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This has 2 carbons and a C=O. If this group is attached to the halo-benzene ring, the structure would be **halo-acetophenone** (C6H4(X)(COCH3)). This structure fits all the criteria: 8 carbons (6+2), di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n    *   **Formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO):** This also has 2 carbons and a C=O. The structure would be **halo-phenylacetaldehyde** (C6H4(X)(CH2CHO)). This structure also fits all the criteria.\n    *   Other groups like carboxymethyl (-CH2COOH) or methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH3) would also fit the carbon count and functional group requirement, but we will see that their expected NMR spectra do not match any of the options.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Options**\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to match the predicted 1H NMR spectrum of our candidate structures with the given options. A di-substituted benzene ring will have 4 aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Option A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows no signals in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). It cannot be the correct answer.\n\n*   **Option C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows only one aromatic proton (1H, s), which would suggest a tetra-substituted ring, contradicting the \"di-substituted\" information. It cannot be the correct answer.\n\n*   **Option B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, is highly characteristic of a **para (1,4)-substituted** benzene ring. The chemical shifts, being far downfield (>7.5 ppm), indicate that both substituents are electron-withdrawing.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** `2.3 (3H, s)`. A singlet integrating to 3 protons in this region (~2.1-2.6 ppm) is the classic signal for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (**-COCH3**).\n    *   **Matching Structure:** This spectrum perfectly matches the description of **p-halo-acetophenone**. The acetyl group (-COCH3) and the halogen (-X) are both electron-withdrawing and are in a para arrangement. The total proton count is 4 (aromatic) + 3 (methyl) = 7H, which matches the integration (2H + 2H + 3H = 7H).\n\n*   **Option D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Characteristic Peaks:** The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is unmistakably an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO). The signal at `3.7 (2H, s)` is consistent with a methylene group adjacent to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl (-Ar-**CH2**-CHO).\n    *   **Matching Structure:** This data points towards the **p-halo-phenylacetaldehyde** structure.\n    *   **Inconsistency:** However, there is a major problem. The aromatic signals are at `7.8` and `7.6` ppm. For a phenylacetaldehyde, the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group is insulated from the ring by a CH2 group. Its effect on the ring is minimal. The aromatic protons should therefore appear much closer to the region for a simple halobenzene, around 7.2-7.4 ppm. The downfield shifts of 7.6-7.8 ppm are inconsistent with this structure. Such strong deshielding requires direct conjugation of the ring with an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl, as seen in acetophenone.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\n*   Option B describes the NMR spectrum of p-halo-acetophenone. All features of the spectrum (aromatic pattern, aromatic shifts, aliphatic signal) are consistent with this structure.\n*   Option D contains an internal contradiction: the aliphatic signals point to a phenylacetaldehyde structure, but the aromatic signals are in a region that is chemically incorrect for that structure.\n*   Therefore, the compound is a halo-acetophenone, and the correct 1H NMR data is given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis question asks to identify the correct ¹H NMR data for a specific chemical compound. Let's break down the information given to deduce the structure of the compound and predict its NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula and Basic Structure:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means we start with a benzene ring (C₆H₆) and replace two hydrogen atoms with two substituent groups. The core is C₆H₄.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms is 8. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The FTIR data confirms the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X, where X is a halogen like Cl, Br, or I).\n\n2.  **Determine the Substituents and Isomers:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X), which contains no carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both the carbonyl group and the two carbon atoms. The most common and stable chemical group fitting this description is an **acetyl group** (-COCH₃).\n    *   So, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n    *   Since it is di-substituted, the halogen and the acetyl group can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: *ortho* (1,2-), *meta* (1,3-), or *para* (1,4-).\n\n3.  **Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Isomer:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (on the C₆H₄ ring):** There are 4 protons on the ring.\n        *   For *ortho* and *meta* isomers, the molecule is unsymmetrical. This would result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, likely appearing as complex multiplets.\n        *   For the ***para* (1,4-) isomer**, the molecule is symmetrical. There are only two distinct types of aromatic protons. The two protons next to the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons next to the halogen are equivalent. This symmetry results in a very characteristic pattern: **two doublets**, each integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Substituent Protons (on the -COCH₃ group):**\n        *   The acetyl group has a methyl group (-CH₃). These three protons are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they will appear as a **singlet** integrating to **3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone) is typically around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given NMR Data Options:**\n\n    *   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** It shows two doublets at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, each for 2 hydrogens. This is the classic signature of a **para-substituted** aromatic ring. The downfield chemical shifts (>7.5 ppm) are consistent with protons on a ring attached to two electron-withdrawing groups (both halogens and the acetyl group are deactivating/electron-withdrawing).\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** It shows a singlet at 2.3 ppm for 3 hydrogens. This perfectly matches the signal for an acetyl methyl group.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This data is a perfect match for a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    *   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not a ketone. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The integration in the aromatic region is incorrect. A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons, not 5 (1H + 2H + 2H). This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   There are no signals in the typical aromatic proton region (usually 6.5-8.5 ppm). This contradicts the fact that the compound has an aromatic ring. This option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that correctly describes the ¹H NMR spectrum for the compound deduced from the problem statement (a para-haloacetophenone).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Information from the Question:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituent groups attached.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One of the substituents is a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, or -I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote this as -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen, -X. This substituent contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   Let's consider possible C2 groups that contain a carbonyl (C=O):\n        *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3)**: This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. This is a very common substituent.\n        *   **Formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO)**: This also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group (in an aldehyde).\n        *   Other possibilities like a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or a carboxylic acid group (-CH2COOH) also fit the carbon count and carbonyl requirement.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data in the Options:**\n    *   Let's look for patterns. Options B and D both show a similar pattern in the aromatic region: `~7.8 (2H, d)` and `~7.6 (2H, d)`. This means there are two signals, each representing two equivalent protons, and each is a doublet. This is a classic, textbook pattern for a **para- (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two on the other.\n    *   Options A and C do not show signals in the typical aromatic proton chemical shift range (6.5-8.5 ppm), or the patterns do not match a disubstituted benzene ring. They can be eliminated.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Remaining Options (B and D) with Plausible Structures:**\n\n    *   **Candidate Structure 1: p-Haloacetophenone.**\n        *   This structure consists of a benzene ring with a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3) in a para arrangement.\n        *   It fits all initial criteria: di-substituted aromatic ring, 8 total carbons (6+2), carbonyl group, and aromatic-halogen bond.\n        *   **Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n            *   **Aromatic Protons:** Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, due to the para substitution. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group will be further downfield. This matches the `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` pattern.\n            *   **Aliphatic Protons:** A methyl group (-CH3) is attached to a carbonyl. It has no adjacent protons, so it will appear as a **singlet (s)**. It will integrate to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n        *   **Compare with Option D:** `1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`. This is a **perfect match** for the predicted spectrum of p-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **Candidate Structure 2: (p-Halophenyl)acetaldehyde.**\n        *   This structure has a halogen (-X) and a formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO) in a para arrangement.\n        *   It also fits all initial criteria.\n        *   **Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n            *   **Aromatic Protons:** Two doublets, each for 2H. This matches the `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` pattern.\n            *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** A very downfield signal, typically 9-10 ppm. It is adjacent to the -CH2- group, so it should be split into a **triplet (t)**. It would integrate to **1H**.\n            *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-):** A signal deshielded by the ring and the carbonyl, typically ~3.5-4.0 ppm. It is adjacent to the -CHO proton, so it should be split into a **doublet (d)**. It would integrate to **2H**.\n        *   **Compare with Option B:** `1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`. The chemical shifts are plausible for this structure. However, the splitting pattern is incorrect. Both the aldehyde and methylene protons are listed as **singlets (s)**, not the expected triplet and doublet. While small coupling constants can sometimes appear as singlets, this is less likely and makes the data a poorer fit than option D.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The 1H NMR data in option D is a textbook, unambiguous match for p-haloacetophenone, a structure that perfectly satisfies all the conditions given in the problem statement. The data in option B, while corresponding to another plausible structure, has a questionable splitting pattern. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Compound's Description:**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n*   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR - Carbonyl group:** The compound contains a C=O group.\n*   **FTIR - Aromatic-halogen bond:** A halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Propose Candidate Structures:**\n\nBased on the information above, one substituent is a halogen (-X). The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. Let's consider the possibilities for this second substituent:\n\n*   **An acetyl group:** -C(=O)CH3. This has two carbons and a carbonyl group. The resulting compound would be a **haloacetophenone**. The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (substituent) = 8. This is a strong candidate.\n*   **A formyl-methyl group:** -CH2CHO. This also has two carbons and a carbonyl group. The resulting compound would be a **(halophenyl)acetaldehyde**. The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (substituent) = 8. This is another strong candidate.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n\nLet's examine the provided NMR data to see which structure it supports. The options that show signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) are A and C. Options B and D can be quickly eliminated.\n\n*   **Option B:** Has no signals in the aromatic region. This contradicts the presence of an aromatic ring.\n*   **Option D:** Shows only one aromatic proton (1H, s). A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons. This is incorrect.\n\nNow, let's analyze the plausible options, A and C. Both show a pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H (`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`). This is a classic signature for **para (1,4) substitution** on a benzene ring, where the two substituents are different enough electronically to create an AA'BB' system that appears as two distinct doublets.\n\nSo, we are comparing **4-haloacetophenone** and **4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**4. Evaluate Option A vs. Option C:**\n\n*   **Option A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Structure Match:** This spectrum corresponds to **4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde**.\n        *   `9.9 (1H, s)`: This is the characteristic chemical shift for an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO).\n        *   `3.7 (2H, s)`: This is a typical shift for a **methylene group** (-CH2-) adjacent to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Aromatic protons.\n    *   **Consistency Check:** The group attached to the ring is -CH2CHO. The electron-withdrawing carbonyl group is insulated from the ring by a CH2 group. Therefore, the -CH2CHO group is only weakly deactivating. It would not shift the aromatic protons so far downfield to 7.6-7.8 ppm. The expected shifts would be much closer to those of toluene or ethylbenzene (around 7.1-7.3 ppm). For example, the protons of 4-chlorophenylacetaldehyde appear around 7.3 and 7.2 ppm. The aromatic shifts in this option are inconsistent with the proposed structure.\n\n*   **Option C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Structure Match:** This spectrum corresponds to **4-haloacetophenone**.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is in the region for a **methyl group** (-CH3). The singlet multiplicity indicates it's next to a quaternary carbon, like the carbonyl carbon in an acetyl group.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Aromatic protons.\n    *   **Consistency Check:** The group attached to the ring is an acetyl group, -C(=O)CH3. The carbonyl is directly attached to the ring and is a strong electron-withdrawing group. This deshields the aromatic protons, especially those ortho to the acetyl group, pushing their chemical shifts significantly downfield. Shifts of 7.6-7.8 ppm are very characteristic for this type of structure. For example, 4-bromoacetophenone shows peaks at 7.82 and 7.61 ppm. The aromatic data is a very good fit. The methyl group shift at 2.3 ppm is slightly more upfield than the typical ~2.6 ppm for acetophenones, but this is a much smaller and more plausible discrepancy than the large error in the aromatic shifts in Option A.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemical shifts of aromatic protons are a strong indicator of the electronic nature of the substituents. The downfield shifts of 7.8 and 7.6 ppm strongly support the presence of a powerful, directly attached electron-withdrawing group like the acetyl group in 4-haloacetophenone. The data in Option A is inconsistent with the electronic effects of a -CH2CHO group. Therefore, Option C is the best match for the described compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n*   **Core Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** 8. Since the benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbons (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X), meaning a halogen (like F, Cl, Br, I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Molecular Structure:**\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible structures for a two-carbon substituent containing a C=O group:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This fits perfectly. It has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The resulting molecule would be a halo-acetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n    *   **Phenylacetaldehyde derivative (-CH2CHO):** This also fits. The substituent -CH2CHO has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The resulting molecule would be a halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n*   Both `X-C6H4-COCH3` and `X-C6H4-CH2CHO` are valid structures based on the initial description. Both have 8 carbons, a di-substituted ring, a carbonyl, and an aromatic-halogen bond. The molecular formula for both would be C8H7XO, meaning they have 7 protons.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectra for the Possible Structures:**\nThe options present spectra with two doublets in the aromatic region, which is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) substitution pattern**. So we will assume para-substitution for our analysis.\n\n*   **Case 1: para-halo-acetophenone (p-X-C6H4-COCH3)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** The benzene ring has two types of protons. The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be strongly deshielded. The two protons ortho to the halogen will also be deshielded, but typically less so. We expect two doublets in the region of **~7.4-8.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH3) is attached to a carbonyl. This deshields the protons. We expect a singlet (no adjacent protons) around **~2.3-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Total Protons:** 4H (aromatic) + 3H (methyl) = 7H.\n\n*   **Case 2: para-halo-phenylacetaldehyde (p-X-C6H4-CH2CHO)**\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (1H):** The aldehyde proton (-CHO) is highly deshielded. We expect a singlet around **~9.5-10.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** The -CH2CHO group is less electron-withdrawing than a directly attached carbonyl. The aromatic protons would be less deshielded than in Case 1. We expect two doublets in the region of **~7.1-7.4 ppm**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (2H):** The benzylic methylene protons (-CH2-) are deshielded by both the ring and the adjacent carbonyl. We expect a singlet around **~3.6-3.8 ppm**.\n    *   **Total Protons:** 1H (aldehyde) + 4H (aromatic) + 2H (methylene) = 7H.\n\n**4. Analyze the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect. It lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (7-8 ppm).\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum appears to describe the phenylacetaldehyde structure (Case 2), with the aldehyde (9.9 ppm) and methylene (3.7 ppm) protons matching well. However, the aromatic shifts (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) are too high (too deshielded). They are characteristic of a ketone directly attached to the ring (Case 1), not a phenylacetaldehyde. This option contains an internal inconsistency.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum is a perfect match for our prediction for para-halo-acetophenone (Case 1).\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, consistent with a para-substituted ring bearing a strong electron-withdrawing group. Total integration is 4H.\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** A singlet in the correct region for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. Integration is 3H.\n    *   Total integration is 7H. This is a chemically consistent and accurate spectrum for the structure.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect. A di-substituted benzene ring should have 4 aromatic protons, not 1. The integrations are also inconsistent with any likely structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe NMR data in option C perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for a para-halo-acetophenone, which is a valid structure derived from the problem description. The data in option B, while appearing plausible at first glance, contains chemically inconsistent chemical shifts for the aromatic protons. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Compound Information:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This means we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached to it.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum... presence of a carbonyl group (C=O)\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O functional group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum... presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have a halogen (-X) as one substituent.\n    *   The second substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   Two plausible structures for this second substituent are:\n        *   An acetyl group: -C(=O)CH3. This is a ketone.\n        *   A formylmethyl group: -CH2CHO. This is an aldehyde.\n    *   This gives us two possible candidate molecules:\n        *   **Candidate 1**: A haloacetophenone (Structure: X-C6H4-COCH3). This has 8 carbons, a carbonyl, a halogen on the ring, and is di-substituted.\n        *   **Candidate 2**: A (halophenyl)acetaldehyde (Structure: X-C6H4-CH2CHO). This also has 8 carbons, a carbonyl, a halogen on the ring, and is di-substituted.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum is highly unlikely. A di-substituted benzene ring typically has 4 aromatic protons, and the splitting patterns and integrations here do not match. Ruled out.\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum has no signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). Since the compound is aromatic, this option is incorrect. Ruled out.\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** The two doublets at 7.8 ppm (2H) and 7.6 ppm (2H) are characteristic of a para (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring, indicating a high degree of symmetry.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** The singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H is a classic signal for a methyl group (-CH3) next to a carbonyl (an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n        *   **Overall Fit:** This spectrum perfectly matches the structure of a **para-haloacetophenone**. The electron-withdrawing carbonyl group deshields the aromatic protons, pushing their chemical shifts downfield (to higher ppm values like 7.6-7.8 ppm). The chemical shifts are all consistent with this structure.\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** Like option B, this shows a para-disubstituted pattern.\n        *   **Functional Group/Aliphatic Region:** The singlet at 9.9 ppm (1H) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The singlet at 3.7 ppm (2H) is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the ring (a benzylic position).\n        *   **Overall Fit:** This spectrum suggests the structure of **para-(halophenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n        *   **Inconsistency Check:** Let's check the chemical plausibility. An aldehyde group attached via a methylene (-CH2CHO) is an electron-withdrawing group, but its effect on the ring is insulated by the CH2 spacer. It is significantly less deactivating than a directly attached carbonyl group (-COCH3). Therefore, it would not shift the aromatic protons as far downfield as 7.6-7.8 ppm. The expected chemical shifts for the aromatic protons in this compound would be closer to 7.1-7.4 ppm. The shifts provided (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) are inconsistent with the proposed -CH2CHO substituent.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Option B presents a 1H NMR spectrum that is fully consistent with a plausible structure (para-haloacetophenone) that fits all the criteria given in the problem. Option D describes a spectrum with an internal inconsistency between the aromatic chemical shifts and the proposed substituent. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the problem statement to determine the compound's structure.**\n    1.  **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring with two substituents attached. The base formula for the ring part is C6H4.\n    2.  **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    3.  **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n    4.  **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly bonded to one of the carbons of the benzene ring. Let's denote this substituent as -X.\n\n*   **Step 2: Combine the structural clues to identify the molecule.**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The most common and stable functional group that fits the description \"-C2 and C=O\" is an acetyl group, -C(=O)CH3.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The two substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the possible isomers and their expected 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   The two substituents can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n    *   **Ortho and Meta Isomers**: These isomers are asymmetrical. They would have four unique protons on the aromatic ring, each giving a separate signal (integrating to 1H each) with complex splitting patterns (e.g., doublet of doublets, triplets).\n    *   **Para Isomer (1,4-disubstitution)**: This isomer is symmetrical. Due to the plane of symmetry, there are only two types of protons on the aromatic ring.\n        *   The two protons ortho to the acetyl group are chemically equivalent.\n        *   The two protons ortho to the halogen group are chemically equivalent.\n        *   This results in a characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons (2H).\n        *   The acetyl group (-COCH3) contains three equivalent methyl protons. Since there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon, this signal will be a singlet, integrating to 3 protons (3H).\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the given 1H NMR data options against the expected spectrum for the para-isomer.**\n    *   The expected spectrum for a para-haloacetophenone is:\n        *   Aromatic region (~7.0-8.5 ppm): A doublet for 2H and another doublet for 2H.\n        *   Aliphatic region (~2.0-3.0 ppm): A singlet for 3H.\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a ketone. This would imply a different molecule, one which violates the \"aromatic-halogen bond\" condition (e.g., 4-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde). So, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts at 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are not in the typical range for aromatic protons. So, B is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d)**: This perfectly matches the expected pattern for a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The chemical shifts are appropriate, with the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group appearing further downfield (7.8 ppm).\n        *   **2.3 (3H, s)**: This is a singlet for 3 protons, with a chemical shift typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (an acetyl group).\n        *   This data set is a perfect match for a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   Similar to B, the chemical shifts are not correct for this type of aromatic compound. So, D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion**: The only NMR data that correctly describes a di-substituted 8-carbon aromatic compound with a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond is C, which corresponds to a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n*   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O)\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\nNow, let's assemble the pieces:\n*   We have a halogen substituent (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The only stable and common functional group that fits this description is an **acetyl group** (-COCH3).\n\nSo, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3. This structure has 6 carbons in the ring, 1 carbon in the carbonyl group, and 1 carbon in the methyl group, for a total of 8 carbons. This is consistent with all the information provided.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the Deduced Structure**\n\nA haloacetophenone molecule (X-C6H4-COCH3) has two types of protons that will give signals in the 1H NMR spectrum:\n*   **Methyl Protons (-CH3)**: The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The chemical shift of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone) is typically in the range of 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (-C6H4-)**: There are 4 protons on the benzene ring. Their chemical shift and splitting pattern depend on the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Data in the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on our prediction:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches our prediction for the acetyl methyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: These are two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons. This pattern is characteristic of a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring, where the symmetry results in two sets of equivalent protons. The total number of aromatic protons is 2H + 2H = 4H, which is correct.\n    *   This option is a strong candidate for para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   `9.9 (1H, s)`: A signal around 9-10 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO), not a ketone. Our deduced structure is a ketone. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The shifts at 4.6-4.8 ppm are too low for standard aromatic protons. Also, the `1.3 (2H, s)` signal does not match the 3H singlet of a methyl group. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   Similar to option C, this spectrum lacks the characteristic aromatic proton signals. The chemical shift of the 3H singlet at 1.3 ppm is too low for a methyl ketone. This option is incorrect.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nOnly option A provides a 1H NMR spectrum that is consistent with the deduced structure of a haloacetophenone. The pattern specifically points to a **para-substituted** isomer (e.g., 4'-chloroacetophenone or 4'-bromoacetophenone).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula Information:** The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Structural Information:** It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6) with two groups attached to it.\n    *   **FTIR Spectroscopy Information:**\n        *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n        *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This tells us one of the substituents on the benzene ring is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I).\n\n2.  **Determine the structure of the substituents:**\n    *   The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   The total number of carbons is 8. Therefore, the substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n    *   This means the other substituent must contain both of the 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The most common and stable C2-substituent containing a carbonyl group is the acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Let's check if this fits: An acetyl group has 2 carbons and one C=O. This is a perfect fit.\n\n3.  **Assemble the molecular structure:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   The compound is a haloacetophenone: X-C6H4-COCH3.\n    *   There are three possible positional isomers: ortho, meta, and para.\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the most likely isomer:**\n    *   The 1H NMR options provided show simple splitting patterns (doublets), which are characteristic of a highly symmetric substitution pattern on the benzene ring. The para- (1,4-) substitution pattern is the most symmetric.\n    *   Let's predict the spectrum for **para-haloacetophenone (p-X-C6H4-COCH3)**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** In a para-disubstituted ring, due to symmetry, there are only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons. This typically results in a pattern known as an AA'BB' system, which often appears as two distinct doublets. Each doublet would integrate to 2 protons. The chemical shift for these protons is usually in the range of 7.0-8.0 ppm. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be further downfield (higher ppm) than the protons ortho to the halogen. So, we expect to see something like `~7.8 ppm (2H, d)` and `~7.6 ppm (2H, d)`.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The acetyl group (-COCH3) has three equivalent methyl protons. Since there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon, this signal will be a **singlet (s)**. It will integrate to **3H**. The chemical shift for protons on a carbon next to a carbonyl group (an alpha-keto methyl group) is typically around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n\n5.  **Compare the prediction with the given options:**\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** `~7.8 (2H, d)`, `~7.6 (2H, d)`, `~2.3 (3H, s)`.\n    *   **Option A) 1H NMR: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**: Incorrect. Lacks the signals for aromatic protons in the 7-8 ppm range.\n    *   **Option B) 1H NMR: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**: Incorrect. The aromatic region is wrong (only 1H), and integrations are suspect.\n    *   **Option C) 1H NMR: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**: Incorrect. The peak at 9.9 ppm indicates an aldehyde, not a ketone. An aldehyde-containing structure consistent with the C8 count (like (halophenyl)acetaldehyde, X-C6H4-CH2CHO) would show coupling between the -CH2- and -CHO protons (a doublet and a triplet), not two singlets.\n    *   **Option D) 1H NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**: This is a perfect match with our prediction for para-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Represents the four protons on the para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: Represents the three protons of the methyl group in the acetyl substituent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is a para-haloacetophenone, and the NMR data in option D correctly describes it.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the molecular formula and functional groups.**\n    *   The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms is 8. Therefore, the substituents on the ring must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X). This means one substituent is a halogen atom (-X) attached directly to the aromatic ring, and the other substituent contains the two carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   A substituent with 2 carbons and a carbonyl group is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n*   **Step 2: Deduce the structure of the compound.**\n    *   Based on Step 1, the compound consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen atom (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3). The molecular formula is C8H7XO. The common name for this type of molecule is a haloacetophenone.\n    *   The problem states it is a di-substituted ring. The substitution can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the provided 1H NMR data options to determine the substitution pattern.**\n    *   Aromatic protons typically appear in the chemical shift range of 6.5-8.5 ppm.\n    *   Let's examine the aromatic region signals in the options:\n        *   A) 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)\n        *   B) No aromatic signals. This option is incorrect.\n        *   C) 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)\n        *   D) 6.9 (1H, s). A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n    *   Both options A and C show a pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons. This is a classic, highly symmetrical pattern characteristic of a **para (1,4) di-substituted** benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, the four aromatic protons exist as two sets of chemically equivalent protons, leading to two signals that appear as doublets due to coupling with their adjacent proton.\n\n*   **Step 4: Predict the full 1H NMR spectrum for the deduced structure (para-haloacetophenone) and compare it with the remaining options (A and C).**\n    *   **Structure:** para-haloacetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4):** As determined in Step 3, we expect two doublets, each integrating to 2H, in the region of ~7.5-8.0 ppm. The protons ortho to the strongly electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be further downfield (higher ppm) than the protons ortho to the halogen.\n    *   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are attached to a carbonyl. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **singlet**. This singlet will integrate to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around **2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Evaluate options A and C against the prediction.**\n    *   **Option A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum has a signal at 9.9 ppm, which is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone.\n        *   It also lacks the 3H singlet around 2.3 ppm for the acetyl methyl group.\n        *   Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This perfectly matches the expected pattern for the 4 aromatic protons in a para-substituted ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet integrating to 3H at a chemical shift of 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches the expected signal for the acetyl methyl group (-COCH3).\n        *   This spectrum is a perfect match for para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a para-haloacetophenone, and the correct 1H NMR data is provided in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Compound's Description**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents. The ring itself has 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate ... an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\n**2. Determine the Possible Structures**\n\nBased on the analysis above:\n*   Substituent 1 is a Halogen (-X).\n*   Substituent 2 must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n\nLet's figure out the structure of the second substituent:\n*   It has 2 carbons and a C=O group.\n*   Possibility A: An acetyl group, **-COCH3**. This fits the criteria. The total structure would be a **haloacetophenone** (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n*   Possibility B: A formylmethyl group, **-CH2CHO**. This also fits the criteria. The total structure would be a **(halophenyl)acetaldehyde** (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n\nBoth structures have 8 carbons, a di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond. Both have the general formula C8H7XO, meaning they should have 7 protons in their 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Options**\n\nThe problem asks us to identify the correct 1H NMR spectrum among the given options. A key feature of a di-substituted benzene ring is that it has 4 aromatic protons, typically appearing in the chemical shift range of 6.5-8.5 ppm.\n\n*   **Option B) `4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)`**: This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the correct answer.\n*   **Option C) `6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)`**: This spectrum shows only one proton in the aromatic region (1H at 6.9 ppm). A di-substituted ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This cannot be the correct answer.\n\nThis leaves us with Option A and Option D. Both show signals in the aromatic region.\n\n**4. Compare Option A and Option D**\n\nLet's analyze the remaining options in the context of our two possible structures. Both options show two doublets for 2 protons each (`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`). This \"two-doublet\" pattern is characteristic of a **para (1,4) substitution** on the benzene ring, where symmetry results in two sets of equivalent protons.\n\n*   **Option D) `1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`**\n    *   This spectrum has a total of 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 protons. This matches our expected proton count for C8H7XO.\n    *   The signal at **2.3 ppm (3H, s)** is a singlet integrating to 3 protons. This is the classic signature of a methyl group next to a carbonyl (**-COCH3**), i.e., an acetyl group.\n    *   The aromatic signals at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm are downfield, which is consistent with the presence of two electron-withdrawing groups (the halogen and the acetyl group) on the ring.\n    *   This spectrum is a perfect match for **4-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **Option A) `1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`**\n    *   This spectrum has a total of 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7 protons. This also matches our expected proton count.\n    *   The signal at **9.9 ppm (1H, s)** is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**.\n    *   The signal at **3.7 ppm (2H, s)** is characteristic of a methylene group (**-CH2-**) attached to an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.\n    *   This spectrum corresponds to the **4-(halophenyl)acetaldehyde** structure.\n    *   **However, there is a significant inconsistency**: In a -CH2-CHO group, the methylene protons and the aldehyde proton are on adjacent atoms and should couple with each other. We would expect the aldehyde proton to be a triplet and the methylene protons to be a doublet. The spectrum incorrectly lists them both as singlets. Furthermore, the aromatic shifts (7.8, 7.6 ppm) are significantly higher than what is typically observed for phenylacetaldehyde derivatives (~7.2-7.4 ppm), as the -CH2- group partially insulates the ring from the carbonyl's strong electron-withdrawing effect.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nComparing the two plausible options, the data in Option D is chemically sound and provides a very accurate description of 4-haloacetophenone. The data in Option A contains inconsistencies in both multiplicity and chemical shift for the proposed 4-(halophenyl)acetaldehyde structure. Therefore, the compound is 4-haloacetophenone, and its correct NMR spectrum is given by option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular structure from the given information.**\n\n1.  **Core Structure:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means it's a benzene ring with two substituents. A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n2.  **Total Carbons:** The compound has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" This means the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n3.  **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A \"carbonyl group\" (C=O) is present.\n    *   An \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (Ar-X) is present. This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, I) directly attached to the benzene ring.\n4.  **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   A substituent with 2 carbons and a carbonyl group is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Thus, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The structure consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen atom and an acetyl group.\n5.  **Isomerism:** Since the ring is di-substituted, there are three possible isomers: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), and para (1,4). The 1H NMR data, particularly the pattern in the aromatic region, will help distinguish between them. A highly symmetric pattern, like two doublets, strongly suggests the para isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the most likely structure (para-haloacetophenone).**\n\n*   **Structure:** A para-substituted benzene ring with -X at position 4 and -COCH3 at position 1.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry along the axis passing through the two substituents. This simplifies the NMR spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons on the ring. Due to symmetry, they are of two types:\n    *   Two protons are ortho to the acetyl group (and meta to the halogen). They are chemically equivalent. They will be split by their single neighbor, resulting in a doublet. These protons are adjacent to the strongly electron-withdrawing carbonyl group, so they will be shifted significantly downfield (typically > 7.7 ppm).\n    *   Two protons are ortho to the halogen (and meta to the acetyl group). They are also chemically equivalent and will appear as a doublet. They will be less downfield than the other pair.\n    *   So, we expect to see **two doublets, each integrating to 2H**, in the aromatic region (7.0-8.0 ppm).\n*   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The acetyl group has three protons. These protons are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **singlet, integrating to 3H**. Because they are attached to a carbonyl carbon, their chemical shift will be around 2.5-2.7 ppm.\n\n**Summary of Predicted Spectrum:**\n*   A doublet (2H) in the aromatic region.\n*   A doublet (2H) in the aromatic region.\n*   A singlet (3H) in the alkyl region (~2.6 ppm).\n\n**Step 3: Compare the prediction with the given options.**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The 9.9 ppm signal is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. The structure would have to be a halo-phenylacetaldehyde. For that structure, the signal at 3.7 ppm (CH2) should be a doublet and the signal at 9.9 ppm (CHO) should be a triplet (or a broad singlet due to small coupling), not singlets as listed. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d):** This pattern perfectly matches the expected two doublets for a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is a singlet integrating to 3H, which perfectly matches the acetyl methyl group. The chemical shift of 2.3 ppm is slightly lower than the typical ~2.6 ppm but is entirely plausible and the most reasonable fit.\n    *   This option is an excellent match for para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be correct for a compound containing a benzene ring.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows only one aromatic proton (1H at 6.9 ppm). A di-substituted benzene ring must have four aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the compound is a para-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data in option B is the only one that correctly represents the number of signals, their multiplicities, integration, and approximate chemical shifts for this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Core Structure:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring) and contains a total of 8 carbon atoms. A benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbons.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The FTIR spectrum shows the presence of:\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X), meaning a halogen atom is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Goal:** Identify the correct 1H NMR spectrum from the four options provided.\n\n**2. Propose a Plausible Chemical Structure**\n\n*   Based on the information, we have a benzene ring with two substituents: a halogen (-X) and another group containing two carbons and a carbonyl group.\n*   The most straightforward and common chemical group that fits the \"2 carbons and a carbonyl\" description is an **acetyl group** (-COCH₃).\n*   Therefore, the most likely structure is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n*   The total number of protons is 4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group, for a total of 7 protons.\n\n**3. Analyze the Effect of Substitution Pattern on the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe two substituents can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4).\n\n*   ***Ortho* and *Meta* Isomers:** In these arrangements, all four protons on the aromatic ring are in different chemical environments. This would lead to a complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region (typically four separate multiplets).\n*   ***Para* Isomer (1,4-disubstituted):** This isomer has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen equivalent to each other. This results in a much simpler spectrum in the aromatic region, typically consisting of two distinct doublets, each integrating to 2H.\n\n**4. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the *para*-Haloacetophenone**\n\nLet's assume the structure is the *para* isomer (4-haloacetophenone) and predict its spectrum:\n\n*   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** These three protons are on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group. They have no neighboring protons to couple with.\n    *   **Signal:** A singlet (s).\n    *   **Integration:** 3H.\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** Typically around 2.1-2.6 ppm for a methyl ketone.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are two sets of equivalent protons.\n    *   **Signal:** Two doublets (d).\n    *   **Integration:** Each doublet will integrate to 2H.\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** Both the acetyl group (-COCH₃) and the halogen (-X) are electron-withdrawing groups, which de-shield the aromatic protons, shifting them downfield (to a higher ppm value) compared to benzene (7.26 ppm). The carbonyl group has a stronger de-shielding effect on its adjacent (ortho) protons. Therefore, we expect one doublet to be further downfield than the other. A reasonable range would be ~7.5-8.0 ppm.\n\n**5. Compare the Predicted Spectrum with the Given Options**\n\n*   **Predicted Spectrum:** A singlet (3H) around 2.3 ppm, and two doublets (2H each) between 7.5 and 8.0 ppm.\n\nNow let's examine the options:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: A 3-proton singlet at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches the methyl group of the acetyl substituent.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: Two 2-proton doublets in the downfield aromatic region. This perfectly matches the pattern for a *para*-substituted benzene ring with two different electron-withdrawing groups. The signal at 7.8 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the more strongly de-shielding carbonyl group, and the signal at 7.6 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the halogen.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match for 4-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts of 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are too low for aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This would imply a different structure, like 4-halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO), which also has 8 carbons. However, in this structure, the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl is insulated from the ring by a -CH₂- group. The aromatic protons would appear at a much lower chemical shift (typically ~7.2-7.4 ppm), not at 7.6 and 7.8 ppm. Therefore, this data is internally inconsistent.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This pattern does not match any plausible structure and contains unusual signals (e.g., a 2H singlet at 1.3 ppm). This is incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only option that correctly describes the 1H NMR spectrum for a compound fitting the given criteria is A. The compound is a 4-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n*   **Step 1: Deduce the molecular structure from the given information.**\n    *   **\"6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring as the core structure, which accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents on the ring must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"di-substituted\"**: There are two groups attached to the benzene ring.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: A carbonyl group is C=O. This group must be part of one of the substituents.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... as well as an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, I), let's denote it as 'X', is directly attached to the aromatic ring. This is one of the two substituents.\n    *   **Combining the substituent information**: One substituent is a halogen (-X). The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   **Proposed Structure**: The compound is a haloacetophenone. Its general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3. This structure has 6 carbons in the ring and 2 carbons in the acetyl group, for a total of 8 carbons, matching all the given information.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for the proposed structure.**\n    *   The structure is a haloacetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n    *   It will have signals from the acetyl group's protons and the aromatic ring's protons.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3)**: The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Since the methyl group is attached to a carbonyl group, it will be deshielded and appear at a chemical shift of approximately 2.0-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Aromatic protons (-C6H4-)**: There are four protons on the di-substituted benzene ring. Their signals will appear in the aromatic region, typically between 6.5 and 8.5 ppm. The pattern of these signals depends on the relative positions of the two substituents (*ortho*, *meta*, or *para*).\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the given 1H NMR data options against the expected spectrum.**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches the expected signal for the acetyl methyl group (-COCH3).\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: These are two signals in the aromatic region. Each is a **doublet (d)** and integrates to **2H**. The total number of aromatic protons is 2H + 2H = 4H, which is correct. A pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring due to its symmetry. The protons *ortho* to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group are more deshielded (7.8 ppm) than the protons *ortho* to the halogen (7.6 ppm). This data is fully consistent with a *para*-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical range for aromatic protons. This option describes a non-aromatic compound.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. An 8-carbon aldehyde could be X-C6H4-CH2CHO. However, for this structure, the aldehyde proton should be a triplet and the -CH2- protons should be a doublet. The provided splitting (two singlets) is incorrect. Also, this structure contains only 7 total protons (4 aromatic + 2 CH2 + 1 CHO), which matches the integration, but the splitting is inconsistent.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   Similar to option B, the signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the aromatic region. Also, a singlet for 2H at 1.3 ppm is highly unusual. This data does not match the described compound.\n\n*   **Conclusion**: Option A is the only choice that accurately represents the 1H NMR spectrum of a haloacetophenone, specifically the *para* isomer. The signals for the acetyl methyl group and the characteristic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring are all present and correct.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n*   **Step 1: Determine the molecular structure from the given information.**\n    1.  **\"6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring, which accounts for 6 carbon atoms and has the formula C6H6 as a base.\n    2.  **\"di-substituted\"**: Two hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring are replaced by two substituent groups. This leaves 4 hydrogen atoms on the ring itself.\n    3.  **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    4.  **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n    5.  **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates ... an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, I) attached directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Step 2: Combine the structural features.**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). A halogen atom has zero carbon atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   A group with two carbons and a carbonyl group is an acetyl group (-C(=O)CH3).\n    *   So, the compound is a haloacetophenone. Its general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3. The molecular formula is C8H7XO, meaning there should be a total of 7 protons in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Step 3: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the possible isomers (ortho, meta, para).**\n    *   **Acetyl group protons (-COCH3)**: This methyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl group and not adjacent to any carbon with protons. It will appear as a singlet (s) integrating to 3 hydrogens (3H). Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 2.0-2.6 ppm because the carbonyl group is deshielding.\n    *   **Aromatic protons**: There are 4 protons on the ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern:\n        *   **ortho (1,2-substitution)**: All 4 protons are chemically different, leading to a complex multiplet pattern in the aromatic region (approx. 7.0-8.0 ppm).\n        *   **meta (1,3-substitution)**: All 4 protons are chemically different, also leading to a complex pattern, although potentially distinguishable from the ortho isomer.\n        *   **para (1,4-substitution)**: Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are only two types of aromatic protons. The two protons ortho to the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the halogen are equivalent. This results in a characteristic pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 hydrogens (2H).\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the given options against the predicted spectrum.**\n    *   The structure we deduced is a haloacetophenone. We expect to see a 3H singlet around 2.3 ppm and 4H of aromatic signals. The total integration should be 3H + 4H = 7H.\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   Total protons: 1+2+2+2 = 7H.\n        *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone (-COCH3). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   Total protons: 1+2+2+2 = 7H.\n        *   The signals are not in the expected chemical shift ranges for an aromatic ketone. The aromatic region is nearly absent. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   Total protons: 2+2+3 = 7H.\n        *   There are no signals in the typical aromatic region (> 6.5 ppm). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   Total protons: 2+2+3 = 7H.\n        *   **2.3 (3H, s)**: This is a perfect match for the methyl protons of an acetyl group (-COCH3). The chemical shift, integration, and splitting are all correct.\n        *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d)**: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, is the classic signature of a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The chemical shifts are appropriate for protons on a ring with electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   This option perfectly describes the 1H NMR spectrum of a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the given information to deduce the structure of the compound.**\n    1.  **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached to it.\n    2.  **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n    3.  **\"FTIR spectrum... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n    4.  **\"FTIR spectrum... indicate... an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the benzene ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n    5.  **Putting it together**: One substituent is -X. The other substituent must account for the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3). Other possibilities like -CH2CHO or -COOCH3 are less likely or lead to spectra that don't match the options.\n    6.  **Proposed Structure**: The compound is a halo-acetophenone. Its structure is X-C6H4-COCH3.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the provided 1H NMR data options to determine the substitution pattern and confirm the structure.**\n    1.  The 1H NMR spectrum of a di-substituted benzene ring shows 4 protons in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    2.  Let's examine the aromatic regions in the options:\n        *   A: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d) -> 4 aromatic protons.\n        *   B: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d) -> Signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are not in the typical aromatic region. The 6.9 ppm signal is only 1H. This is incorrect.\n        *   C: No signals in the aromatic region. This is incorrect.\n        *   D: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d) -> 4 aromatic protons.\n    3.  Both options A and D show two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons. This pattern is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) substituted** benzene ring, where the two substituents are on opposite sides of the ring. This high symmetry results in only two distinct types of aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the full NMR spectra of the remaining options (A and D) to the proposed structure (p-halo-acetophenone).**\n    *   Our proposed structure is p-halo-acetophenone. Let's predict its 1H NMR spectrum:\n        *   **Aromatic Protons**: The acetyl group (-COCH3) is electron-withdrawing and is conjugated with the ring. This will strongly deshield the adjacent protons. The halogen is also electron-withdrawing. We expect two doublets in the range of 7.4-8.0 ppm. This matches the aromatic region in both A and D.\n        *   **Substituent Protons**: The acetyl group has a methyl group (-CH3). These 3 protons are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **singlet (s)**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around **2.1-2.7 ppm**.\n\n    *   Now, let's evaluate options A and D based on this prediction:\n        *   **Option A**: 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): **9.9 (1H, s)**, 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), **3.7 (2H, s)**.\n            *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**, not a ketone.\n            *   The peak at 3.7 ppm (2H) would correspond to a -CH2- group.\n            *   This spectrum corresponds to a different structure, p-halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO). While this structure also has 8 carbons, the chemical shifts listed for the aromatic protons (7.6-7.8 ppm) are too high. For this structure, the carbonyl group is not directly conjugated to the ring, so the aromatic protons would be further upfield (closer to 7.2-7.4 ppm). Thus, the data in option A is internally inconsistent.\n\n        *   **Option D**: 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), **2.3 (3H, s)**.\n            *   The aromatic region (7.8, 7.6 ppm) is consistent with the p-halo-acetophenone structure.\n            *   The peak at **2.3 ppm (3H, s)** is a singlet integrating to 3 protons, and its chemical shift falls squarely in the expected range for an acetyl methyl group.\n            *   This spectrum is a perfect match for the predicted spectrum of **p-halo-acetophenone**. For example, the actual spectrum of p-bromoacetophenone is δ 7.84 (d, 2H), 7.61 (d, 2H), 2.59 (s, 3H), which is very similar to the data in option D.\n\n*   **Conclusion**: The compound is a p-halo-acetophenone, and the correct 1H NMR data is provided in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information Provided:**\n\n*   **Compound Type:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** 8. Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbons.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X, where X is a halogen like F, Cl, Br, or I).\n\n**2. Deduce the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   We have a benzene ring with two substituents: a halogen (-X) and a group containing 2 carbons and a carbonyl.\n*   Let's identify the 2-carbon, carbonyl-containing group. The most common and simple structures are:\n    *   An **acetyl group** (-COCH3). This has 2 carbons and a C=O.\n    *   A **(phenyl)acetaldehyde** group (-CH2CHO). This also has 2 carbons and a C=O.\n    *   A **(phenyl)acetic acid** group (-CH2COOH). This also fits.\n\n*   This leads to two primary candidate structures:\n    1.  **Halo-acetophenone:** A halogen and an acetyl group on a benzene ring (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n    2.  **Halo-phenylacetaldehyde:** A halogen and a -CH2CHO group on a benzene ring (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n    3.  **Halo-phenylacetic acid:** A halogen and a -CH2COOH group on a benzene ring (X-C6H4-CH2COOH).\n\n*   All these candidates have 8 carbons, are di-substituted aromatic rings, and contain the required functional groups. All would have a molecular formula of C8H7XO, which means they have 7 hydrogen atoms.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n\nLet's evaluate each option against the deduced structures. The total integration for a C8H7XO compound should be 7H.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 2 + 2 + 3 = 7H. This is correct.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum shows no signals in the typical aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm). This is inconsistent with an aromatic compound. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7H. This is correct.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum suggests the structure is halo-phenylacetaldehyde.\n        *   `9.9 (1H, s)`: This is the characteristic chemical shift for an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO).\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets for the aromatic protons is characteristic of **para (1,4) substitution**.\n        *   `3.7 (2H, s)`: This is a plausible shift for a **methylene group** (-CH2-) situated between a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Plausibility Check:** While the signals match the expected types of protons, the chemical shifts for the aromatic protons (`7.8` and `7.6` ppm) are unusually high (deshielded) for a ring substituted with a weakly electron-withdrawing group like -CH2CHO. This makes the option suspect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7H. This is correct.\n    *   **Analysis:** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only shows one proton at 6.9 ppm. This is inconsistent. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 2 + 2 + 3 = 7H. This is correct.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum suggests the structure is halo-acetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Again, this pattern indicates **para (1,4) substitution**. The chemical shifts are appropriate for a ring substituted with a strongly electron-withdrawing group.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a characteristic chemical shift for the protons of a **methyl ketone** (-COCH3). The signal is a singlet because there are no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Plausibility Check:** The structure p-halo-acetophenone is perfectly consistent with this NMR data. The strongly electron-withdrawing acetyl group (-COCH3) deshields the aromatic protons, pushing their chemical shifts downfield to the observed 7.6-7.8 ppm range. The methyl ketone protons are correctly represented by the singlet at 2.3 ppm.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion:**\n\nComparing options B and D, both represent plausible structures that fit the initial description. However, the chemical shifts in option D are much more consistent with its corresponding structure (p-halo-acetophenone) than the shifts in option B are with its corresponding structure (p-halo-phenylacetaldehyde). The high chemical shift of the aromatic protons (7.8 ppm) strongly points to a powerful, directly-attached electron-withdrawing group like an acetyl group, not a group insulated by a CH2 unit.\n\nTherefore, the correct 1H NMR data belongs to a halo-acetophenone.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **Compound Type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached.\n    *   **Total Carbon Atoms:** 8. The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **FTIR Data (Functional Groups):**\n        *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n        *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present.\n\n2.  **Deduce the structure of the compound:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring with a halogen atom (-X) directly attached to it.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms: 2 carbons and 1 oxygen (from the carbonyl group).\n    *   Let's list the possibilities for a 2-carbon, carbonyl-containing substituent:\n        *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. This is a very common and stable functional group. The resulting molecule would be a **halo-acetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3)**.\n        *   **Formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO):** This also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl (aldehyde) group. The resulting molecule would be a **halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO)**.\n\n3.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectra for the possible structures and compare with the given options.**\n    The substitution pattern on the benzene ring can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4). The simplest and most symmetrical pattern is para-substitution, which often results in two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons and appearing as a doublet. Let's analyze the options to see if they fit this pattern.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Option A:** `1H NMR: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)`\n        *   The aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) only shows a singlet for 1H. This is not consistent with a di-substituted ring, which should have 4 aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Option D:** `1H NMR: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)`\n        *   This spectrum has no signals in the aromatic region. The problem explicitly states the compound has an aromatic ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Options B and C:** Both options show two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 & 7.6 ppm), each integrating to 2H. This \"two-doublet, 2H each\" pattern is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) disubstituted benzene ring**. This suggests our compound is para-substituted.\n\n4.  **Detailed analysis of the two remaining plausible structures and their corresponding NMR options.**\n\n    *   **Structure 1: para-halo-acetophenone (matches Option B)**\n        *   **Structure:** A halogen and an acetyl group (-COCH3) are at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4) of the benzene ring.\n        *   **Predicted 1H NMR:**\n            *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent protons on the ring. We expect two signals, each for 2H, appearing as doublets (an AA'BB' system). The electron-withdrawing acetyl group and halogen will shift these protons downfield (to a higher ppm value), typically in the 7.4-8.0 ppm range.\n            *   **Methyl Protons (-COCH3):** The three protons on the methyl group are adjacent to a carbonyl group, not another carbon with protons. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift is around 2.2-2.6 ppm.\n        *   **Comparing with Option B:** `1H NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`\n            *   This matches our prediction perfectly. We have two 2H doublets in the aromatic region and a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm.\n\n    *   **Structure 2: para-halo-phenylacetaldehyde (related to Option C)**\n        *   **Structure:** A halogen and a -CH2CHO group are at opposite ends of the ring.\n        *   **Predicted 1H NMR:**\n            *   **Aromatic Protons:** Similar to above, we expect two 2H doublets.\n            *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This proton is adjacent to the -CH2- group. It should couple with the two CH2 protons and appear as a **triplet (t)** (n+1 rule: 2+1=3). Its chemical shift is very far downfield, typically 9.5-10.0 ppm.\n            *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-):** These two protons are adjacent to the aldehyde proton. They should couple with it and appear as a **doublet (d)** (n+1 rule: 1+1=2). The chemical shift is typically around 3.5-4.0 ppm.\n        *   **Comparing with Option C:** `1H NMR: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`\n            *   This option has the correct types of protons (aldehyde, aromatic, methylene). However, the **splitting is incorrect**. It lists the aldehyde proton as a singlet (`s`) instead of a triplet (`t`), and the methylene protons as a singlet (`s`) instead of a doublet (`d`). This contradicts the rules of spin-spin coupling. Therefore, option C describes an impossible spectrum for this structure.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, the only option that correctly describes the 1H NMR spectrum for a compound fitting the given criteria is B. The compound is a para-halo-acetophenone.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This is a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents, so its formula is C6H4.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A **carbonyl group** (C=O) is present.\n    *   An **aromatic-halogen bond** is present. This means a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Assembling the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms, which are 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The only common and stable arrangement for this is an **acetyl group** (-COCH3).\n*   **Putting it all together:** The compound is a haloacetophenone. The molecular formula is C8H7XO (where X is a halogen).\n\n**2. Consider the Isomers**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as three positional isomers: *ortho* (1,2-), *meta* (1,3-), and *para* (1,4-). The 1H NMR spectrum is highly dependent on the substitution pattern.\n\n*   ***ortho*-haloacetophenone:** The two substituents are adjacent. There is no plane of symmetry bisecting the C-C bonds of the ring. This results in four chemically distinct aromatic protons, which would produce a complex splitting pattern (e.g., multiplets, doublets of doublets, etc.).\n*   ***meta*-haloacetophenone:** The substituents are at positions 1 and 3. Again, there is no plane of symmetry, leading to four distinct aromatic protons and a complex spectrum.\n*   ***para*-haloacetophenone:** The substituents are at positions 1 and 4, opposite each other. The molecule has a plane of symmetry. This makes the two protons next to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons next to the halogen equivalent to each other. This symmetry drastically simplifies the spectrum.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for *para*-haloacetophenone**\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons:**\n    *   There are two sets of equivalent protons.\n    *   The protons ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group (-COCH3) will be deshielded and shifted downfield. They are split by their neighbors (the other set of protons), so they will appear as a **doublet (d)**. The integration will be for **2H**. Chemical shift (δ) is expected around 7.8-8.0 ppm.\n    *   The protons ortho to the halogen (-X) will be less downfield. They are also split by their neighbors, appearing as a **doublet (d)**. The integration will be for **2H**. Chemical shift is expected around 7.4-7.6 ppm.\n*   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n    *   The acetyl group has a methyl group (-CH3). These three protons have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they will appear as a **singlet (s)**. The integration will be for **3H**. Its proximity to the carbonyl group shifts it downfield to about 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n\n**Predicted Spectrum Summary:**\n*   A doublet for 2H around 7.8 ppm.\n*   A doublet for 2H around 7.6 ppm.\n*   A singlet for 3H around 2.3 ppm.\n\n**4. Analyze the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts are in the 4-5 ppm range, not the 7-8 ppm range expected for aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H. It also shows a singlet for 3H at a chemical shift typical for an acetyl methyl group. This perfectly matches the prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The splitting pattern and integrations are inconsistent with any of the haloacetophenone isomers. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The singlet at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO), not a ketone. The proposed structure is a ketone. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only option that correctly describes the 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 8-carbon aromatic compound with a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond (*para*-haloacetophenone) is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Compound's Description:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituent groups attached.\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) as well as an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)\"**: This identifies the nature of the two substituents. One is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the ring. The other substituent must contain the two carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must have the formula C2O. The most common and stable functional group with this composition is an acetyl group: -C(=O)CH3.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a halo-acetophenone.\n\n3.  **Determine the Overall Structure and Isomers:**\n    *   The molecule has the structure X-C6H4-COCH3. The total number of protons is 4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group, for a total of 7 protons.\n    *   The two substituents can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions on the benzene ring. We need to analyze the expected 1H NMR for these possibilities.\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Acetyl Group (-COCH3):** This methyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl and has no neighboring protons. It will always appear as a **singlet** integrating to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is in the range of 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons on the ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern:\n        *   **Para (1,4-substitution):** This isomer is symmetrical. It has two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This typically results in two signals, each appearing as a **doublet**, and each integrating to **2H**. This is a very characteristic pattern for para-substitution.\n        *   **Ortho (1,2-substitution):** All 4 aromatic protons are unique. This would give a complex pattern, likely with four separate signals (or overlapping multiplets), each integrating to 1H.\n        *   **Meta (1,3-substitution):** All 4 aromatic protons are also unique. This would also lead to a complex pattern of four 1H signals.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given NMR Data Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (~7-8 ppm). It is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a methyl ketone (-COCH3). This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals and integrations (e.g., 1.3 ppm for a 2H singlet) do not match our predicted structure. It is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, is the classic signature of a **para-substituted** aromatic ring. The chemical shifts are appropriate for a ring substituted with an electron-withdrawing acetyl group and a halogen.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** `2.3 (3H, s)`. This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm, which is a perfect match for the methyl protons of an **acetyl group**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This spectrum perfectly matches the structure of a para-haloacetophenone.\n\nTherefore, the correct 1H NMR data is described in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents, let's call them X and Y.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring itself contains 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents (X and Y) must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's say this is substituent X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   Substituent X is a halogen (-X). It contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   Substituent Y must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   A functional group with 2 carbons and a carbonyl group is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Therefore, the two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Final Structure:**\n    *   The compound is a haloacetophenone, with the general structure X-C6H4-COCH3. The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. This matches all the given information.\n\n4.  **Analyze Potential Isomers and their Expected 1H NMR:**\n    *   The two substituents can be in the ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions.\n    *   **Ortho and Meta Isomers**: These isomers lack symmetry. They would show four distinct signals in the aromatic region (between ~7.0-8.0 ppm), each integrating to 1H, with complex splitting patterns (doublets, triplets, doublet of doublets, etc.).\n    *   **Para Isomer (1,4-disubstitution)**: This isomer has a plane of symmetry passing through the two substituents. This symmetry makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen group equivalent to each other.\n        *   This results in a simpler aromatic spectrum: two signals, each a doublet, and each integrating to 2H.\n        *   The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it will be more deshielded (further downfield, higher ppm value).\n        *   The methyl group (-CH3) of the acetyl substituent is not adjacent to any protons, so it will appear as a singlet, integrating to 3H. Its chemical shift is typically around 2.5-2.6 ppm.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. This contradicts our deduced structure of an acetophenone. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic region**: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). This is the classic A2B2 pattern for a para (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. It matches our predicted pattern for the para-isomer.\n        *   **Aliphatic region**: 2.3 (3H, s). This is a singlet integrating to 3 protons, which is exactly what we expect for the methyl group of the acetyl substituent.\n        *   While the chemical shift of 2.3 ppm is slightly lower than the typical ~2.6 ppm for an acetyl methyl, the overall pattern (two 2H doublets and one 3H singlet) is a perfect match for 4-haloacetophenone. The minor shift variation is acceptable. This option is a very strong candidate.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the correct spectrum for an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This shows only a single proton in the aromatic region, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which must have 4 aromatic protons). This option is incorrect.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, the structure must be a haloacetophenone. Only Option B provides a spectrum that matches the signal pattern (multiplicity and integration) expected for such a compound, specifically the para-isomer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups from the Clues:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituent groups attached.\n*   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR ... carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O functional group.\n*   **\"FTIR ... aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) bonded directly to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as '-X'.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen, -X. This substituent contains 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms AND the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible structures for a 2-carbon substituent containing a carbonyl group:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This has 2 carbons and a C=O. This is a very common substituent.\n    *   **Carboxylic acid group (-CH2COOH):** This has 2 carbons and a C=O, but would also have a very characteristic broad singlet for the acidic -OH proton, typically above 10 ppm. None of the options show this.\n    *   **Acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO):** This has 2 carbons and a C=O (aldehyde). This is also a possibility.\n\n*   Let's evaluate the two most likely structures:\n    *   **Structure 1: Halo-acetophenone.** A halogen and an acetyl group on a benzene ring. The formula would be X-C6H5-COCH3. This has 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8 carbons. It fits all the criteria.\n    *   **Structure 2: (Halo-phenyl)acetaldehyde.** A halogen and a -CH2CHO group on a benzene ring. The formula is X-C6H5-CH2CHO. This has 6 (ring) + 2 (substituent) = 8 carbons. It also fits all the criteria.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Potential Structure and Compare with Options:**\n\nTo have a simple, clean NMR spectrum with doublets in the aromatic region, the most likely substitution pattern is **para (1,4)**. This symmetry results in only two types of aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Prediction for para-halo-acetophenone (Structure 1):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4):** In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of equivalent protons. We expect two signals, each integrating to 2H. Due to coupling with their ortho neighbors, each signal should be a **doublet (d)**. The protons next to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group will be shifted further downfield (higher ppm) than those next to the halogen. So we expect: `~7.5-8.0 ppm (2H, d)` and `~7.4-7.8 ppm (2H, d)`.\n    *   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH3):** The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. We expect one signal, integrating to 3H, as a **singlet (s)**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around **2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Summary for Structure 1:** Two doublets in the aromatic region (each 2H) and one singlet in the alkyl region (3H).\n\n*   **Prediction for para-(halo-phenyl)acetaldehyde (Structure 2):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4):** Similar to above, we expect two **doublets (d)**, each integrating to 2H in the aromatic region (`~7.0-7.5 ppm`).\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** The single proton of the aldehyde group is unique. It has a very characteristic chemical shift, typically **9.5-10.1 ppm**. It is adjacent to the -CH2- group, so it should be split into a **triplet (t)** by the two CH2 protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). We expect: `~9.7 ppm (1H, t)`.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-):** The two protons of the methylene group are adjacent to the aldehyde proton. They will be split into a **doublet (d)** by the single aldehyde proton (n+1 rule, 1+1=2). The chemical shift would be around **3.5-4.0 ppm**. We expect: `~3.7 ppm (2H, d)`.\n    *   **Summary for Structure 2:** Two doublets (aromatic), one triplet (aldehyde), and one doublet (methylene).\n\n**4. Analyze the Given NMR Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**: The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**: This option corresponds to Structure 2, the acetaldehyde derivative. It has the correct chemical shifts for the aldehyde proton (`9.9 ppm`), methylene protons (`3.7 ppm`), and aromatic protons (`7.8`, `7.6 ppm`). **However, the splitting is wrong.** The aldehyde proton should be a triplet, not a singlet, and the methylene protons should be a doublet, not a singlet, due to mutual coupling. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**: Similar to A, the chemical shifts are not characteristic of an aromatic compound of this type. The integration and splitting are also unusual. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**: This data perfectly matches our prediction for **para-halo-acetophenone (Structure 1)**.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H. This signifies a para-substituted ring.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: A singlet for 3H at a chemical shift characteristic of an acetyl methyl group.\n    \nAll aspects (chemical shifts, integration, and splitting) of this option are consistent with the proposed structure of para-halo-acetophenone, which fulfills all the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Decode the Molecular Information from the Question:**\n\n*   **Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The molecule has 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a combined total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A peak for a **carbonyl group (C=O)** is present.\n    *   A peak for an **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)** is present. This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Propose Possible Structures:**\n\nBased on the information above, let's assemble the molecule:\n*   We have a halogen substituent (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both the carbonyl group and the two required carbon atoms.\n*   A very common chemical group that fits this description is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**. It has two carbons and a carbonyl group.\n\nCombining these pieces, the most likely structure is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula would be C₈H₇XO.\n*   Total Carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. (Correct)\n*   Substituents: A halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃). It is di-substituted. (Correct)\n*   Functional Groups: It has an aromatic-halogen bond and a carbonyl group. (Correct)\n*   Total Protons: The benzene ring has 4 protons (C₆H₄), and the methyl group has 3 protons (-CH₃). The total is 4 + 3 = 7 protons.\n\nAnother possibility could be a (halophenyl)acetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO). This also has 8 carbons, a carbonyl, and an Ar-X bond. We will evaluate the NMR data for both possibilities.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n\nThe correct 1H NMR spectrum must account for 7 protons and match the expected chemical shifts and splitting patterns for our proposed structure(s). Aromatic protons typically appear in the δ 6.5-8.5 ppm range.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 1+2+2+2 = 7 protons. This matches.\n    *   **Analysis:** The chemical shifts at δ 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are too low (upfield) for aromatic protons. Only one aromatic proton (1H) is listed. This is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring which must have 4 aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 2+2+3 = 7 protons. This matches.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum has no signals in the typical aromatic region (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm). The signals at δ 4.6-4.8 are not characteristic of aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 1+2+2+2 = 7 protons. This matches.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum corresponds to the (halophenyl)acetaldehyde structure (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n        *   `δ 9.9 (1H, s)`: Correct region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n        *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d)` & `δ 7.6 (2H, d)`: A pattern of two doublets (each 2H) is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) substituted** benzene ring.\n        *   `δ 3.7 (2H, s)`: Plausible region for the methylene protons (-CH₂-).\n        *   **Splitting Error:** However, in the structure X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO, the methylene (-CH₂) protons are adjacent to the aldehyde (-CHO) proton. Due to spin-spin coupling, they must split each other's signals. The -CH₂- signal should be a **doublet**, and the -CHO signal should be a **triplet**. The data incorrectly lists them both as **singlets (s)**. Therefore, this option is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 2+2+3 = 7 protons. This matches.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum is a perfect match for a **para-haloacetophenone (p-X-C₆H₄-COCH₃)**.\n        *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d)` & `δ 7.6 (2H, d)`: This is the classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted** benzene ring. The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, shifting these protons downfield into the correct range.\n        *   `δ 2.3 (3H, s)`: This is the characteristic signal for an acetyl methyl group (-COCH**₃**). It is a **singlet (s)** because it is not adjacent to any other protons. The chemical shift around δ 2.3-2.6 ppm is expected.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n\nThe data in option D perfectly matches the predicted 1H NMR spectrum for para-haloacetophenone, a molecule that satisfies all the conditions given in the problem statement. The data in option C contains an error in the splitting pattern that makes it inconsistent with its corresponding structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information to determine the compound's structure.**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core structure is a benzene ring with two substituent groups attached. A benzene ring itself has the formula C6H6. When di-substituted, it's C6H4R1R2.\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: This means there is a C=O group in one of the substituents.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the benzene ring. Let's call this substituent -X.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular structure.**\n    *   We have one halogen substituent (-X), which contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both the carbonyl group (C=O) and the 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The most common and stable functional group that fits this description is the **acetyl group** (-COCH3). It has exactly 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n    *   So, the compound is an **acetophenone** molecule with a halogen substituent on the ring. The general structure is **haloacetophenone**.\n    *   The molecular formula would be C8H7XO. This gives a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group), which we should see in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n3.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the proposed structure.**\n    *   The structure is a di-substituted benzene ring. The substitution can be *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4).\n    *   **The Acetyl Group (-COCH3)**: The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and are adjacent to a carbonyl group but have no adjacent protons. They will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around **2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **The Aromatic Protons (on the C6H4 ring)**: There are 4 protons on the ring.\n        *   If the substitution is *ortho* or *meta*, the molecule would be asymmetric. We would expect four distinct signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 1H, with complex splitting patterns (e.g., doublets, triplets, doublets of doublets).\n        *   If the substitution is ***para***, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen equivalent to each other. This creates a classic AA'BB' system, which in many cases simplifies and appears as **two distinct doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the given 1H NMR options against the prediction.**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This perfectly matches the signal for the acetyl methyl group (-COCH3).\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, is the characteristic signature of a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   The total integration is 3H + 2H + 2H = 7H, which is correct.\n        *   **This spectrum is a perfect match for a 4-haloacetophenone.**\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. The compound identified is a ketone. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals at `4.8` and `4.6 ppm` are not in the typical range for aromatic protons (which are usually > 6.5 ppm). This data does not represent an aromatic compound of the type we identified.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   Similar to option C, the chemical shifts `4.8` and `4.6 ppm` are incorrect for aromatic protons. The signal at `1.3 (3H, s)` is too upfield for a methyl ketone.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the compound must be a 4-haloacetophenone. Option A provides the exact 1H NMR data pattern expected for this structure: a singlet for the methyl group and a pair of doublets for the para-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information from the Question:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituent groups attached. The substitution can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **\"FTIR ... carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR ... aromatic-halogen bond\"**: A halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I, let's denote it as -X) is directly attached to the aromatic ring. This is one of the two substituents.\n\n**2. Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   We have two substituents: a halogen (-X) and a group containing 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n*   Let's figure out the structure of the second substituent. It must have the formula C₂HᵧO.\n*   Possible structures for this C₂ substituent with a carbonyl group are:\n    *   **Acetyl group:** -C(=O)CH₃. This has 2 carbons and fits the description.\n    *   **Formylmethyl group:** -CH₂CHO. This also has 2 carbons and fits the description.\n*   Now, let's attach these possibilities to the halo-benzene ring.\n    *   **Structure I:** Halo-acetophenone (X-C₆H₄-C(=O)CH₃)\n    *   **Structure II:** Halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)\n*   Both structures have a total of 8 carbons (6 from the ring, 2 from the side chain), a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond. They both fit the initial description.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectra for the Possible Structures:**\n\nTo distinguish between the two possibilities and the different substitution patterns (ortho, meta, para), let's predict what their 1H NMR spectra would look like. We need a total of 7 protons (4 on the ring, 3 on the side chain for acetophenone; 4 on the ring, 3 on the side chain for phenylacetaldehyde).\n\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for Halo-acetophenone (Structure I):**\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The three protons on the methyl group are adjacent to a carbonyl group, which has no protons. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift is around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons on the ring.\n        *   If the substitution is **para (1,4)**, the molecule is symmetric. We will see two signals, each a **doublet (d)** and each integrating to **2H**. This is a very characteristic pattern. The chemical shift will be in the aromatic region, ~7.4-8.0 ppm, because the acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing.\n        *   If the substitution is ortho or meta, the pattern will be more complex, with four distinct signals for the 4 protons.\n\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for Halo-phenylacetaldehyde (Structure II):**\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is adjacent to the -CH₂- group. It will appear as a **triplet (t)**, integrating to **1H**. It is highly deshielded and will appear far downfield, typically **~9.5-10.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH₂-):** These two protons are adjacent to the aldehyde proton (-CHO). They will appear as a **doublet (d)**, integrating to **2H**. The typical chemical shift is around **3.5-4.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons. A **para** substitution would again give a pattern of two **doublets (d)**, each for **2H**. Because the electron-withdrawing carbonyl is not directly attached to the ring, the chemical shifts would be less downfield than for acetophenone, perhaps around ~7.1-7.5 ppm.\n\n**4. Compare Predicted Spectra with the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm). The signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are too upfield. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows a signal at 9.9 ppm (aldehyde), two doublets in the aromatic region (para-substitution), and a signal at 3.7 ppm (methylene). This matches the functional groups of Structure II (halo-phenylacetaldehyde).\n    *   However, there are discrepancies: the aldehyde and methylene protons are shown as singlets (s), not a triplet and a doublet. Also, the aromatic protons are very far downfield (7.6-7.8 ppm), which is more typical for a group directly attached to the ring like in acetophenone.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This option does not show a clear pattern for either proposed structure. It has signals outside the aromatic region and an unusual integration and multiplicity. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`**: This is the classic, textbook pattern for a **para-substituted benzene ring**. It indicates 4 aromatic protons, split into two sets of 2.\n    *   **`2.3 (3H, s)`**: This is a perfect match for a **methyl group next to a carbonyl** (-C(=O)CH₃). A 3H singlet around 2.3 ppm is highly characteristic.\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches our prediction for **para-halo-acetophenone (Structure I)**. Every detail (chemical shifts, integrations, multiplicities) is consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe data in option D provides a perfect match for p-halo-acetophenone. This molecule fits all the criteria given in the question: it is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, it has 8 carbon atoms, it contains a carbonyl group, and it has an aromatic-halogen bond. The NMR data is a textbook example for this structure. While the data in option B has some features of halo-phenylacetaldehyde, it has significant inconsistencies in multiplicity and chemical shift, making D the far better answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the given information:**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n*   **Total Carbons:** 8 C atoms. Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   Presence of a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   Presence of an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X), meaning a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Goal:** Match this information to one of the provided 1H NMR spectra.\n\n**2. Deduce the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   We have a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible structures for the C2-carbonyl substituent:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This group has exactly 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. This is a very plausible option.\n    *   **Phenylacetaldehyde side chain (-CH2CHO):** This also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n*   Now let's combine these possibilities with the halogen substituent to form the final molecule.\n\n    *   **Possibility 1: Halo-acetophenone.** The structure is X-C6H4-COCH3. This has 6 (ring) + 1 (carbonyl C) + 1 (methyl C) = 8 carbons. It has a di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond. This structure fits all the initial criteria.\n\n    *   **Possibility 2: Halo-phenylacetaldehyde.** The structure is X-C6H4-CH2CHO. This also fits the carbon count and substituent requirements.\n\n**3. Analyze the Expected 1H NMR Spectra for the Possible Structures:**\n\n*   **For Halo-acetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3):**\n    *   There are 4 protons on the aromatic ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution (ortho, meta, or para).\n    *   There are 3 protons on the methyl group (`-CH3`). Since this methyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl and has no adjacent protons, it will appear as a **singlet (s)** with an integration of **3H**. Its chemical shift should be around **2.2-2.7 ppm**.\n\n*   **For Halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO):**\n    *   There are 4 protons on the aromatic ring.\n    *   There is 1 proton on the aldehyde group (`-CHO`). This will appear as a signal far downfield, typically **9-10 ppm**. It would likely be a triplet (t) due to coupling with the adjacent CH2 group.\n    *   There are 2 protons on the methylene group (`-CH2-`). This will appear as a signal around **3.5-4.0 ppm**. It would likely be a doublet (d) due to coupling with the aldehyde proton.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given NMR Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum is inconsistent. It has signals at unusual chemical shifts (4.6-4.8 ppm are too low for aromatic protons). The integration of the upfield singlet is 2H, not 3H, which rules out a methyl group.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), which contradicts the presence of a benzene ring.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is characteristic of a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The downfield shifts indicate the presence of electron-withdrawing groups, which both the halogen and acetyl group are.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** `2.3 (3H, s)`. This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches the expected signal for the methyl group of an acetyl substituent (-COCH**3**).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This spectrum is a perfect match for **para-halo-acetophenone**. This molecule satisfies all the conditions given in the problem.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` indicates an **aldehyde** group.\n    *   The `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` pattern again suggests a para-disubstituted ring.\n    *   The `3.7 (2H, s)` suggests a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   This data would correspond to a structure like 4-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde (CHO-C6H4-CH2X).\n    *   However, in this structure, the halogen is attached to the methyl carbon, not the aromatic ring. This contradicts the FTIR data which specifies an **aromatic-halogen bond**. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option that is fully consistent with all the provided information (8 carbons, di-substituted aromatic ring, carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond) is option C. The compound is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\n*   **Step 1: Determine the molecular structure from the given information.**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means it is a benzene ring with two substituents. A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms (C6).\n    *   The compound has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" Since the ring is C6, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n    *   The FTIR spectrum also shows an \"aromatic-halogen bond,\" meaning one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the benzene ring. Let's denote this as -X.\n    *   The halogen substituent (-X) contains 0 carbon atoms. Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The only common and stable functional group that fits this description is the acetyl group: -C(=O)CH3.\n    *   So, the molecule is a haloacetophenone. It consists of a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom and one acetyl group.\n\n*   **Step 2: Consider the possible substitution patterns and predict the 1H NMR spectrum.**\n    *   The two substituents can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4).\n    *   The question describes a spectrum with a very simple and symmetrical aromatic region (two doublets), which is highly characteristic of a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern.\n    *   Let's predict the spectrum for a *para*-haloacetophenone (1-acetyl-4-halobenzene):\n        *   **Symmetry:** In a *para*-disubstituted ring, there is a plane of symmetry. This makes the two protons adjacent to the acetyl group chemically equivalent to each other. It also makes the two protons adjacent to the halogen atom chemically equivalent to each other.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons (on the ring):** There are 4 protons on the ring. Because of the symmetry, they will appear as two distinct signals.\n            *   The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group (positions 2 and 6) are equivalent. They are split by their neighbors (at positions 3 and 5), so they will appear as a **doublet** integrating to **2H**.\n            *   The protons ortho to the halogen group (positions 3 and 5) are also equivalent. They are split by their neighbors (at positions 2 and 6), so they will also appear as a **doublet** integrating to **2H**.\n            *   The typical chemical shift for aromatic protons is in the range of 6.5-8.5 ppm. Both the acetyl group and the halogen are electron-withdrawing, so the signals will be in the downfield part of this range (e.g., 7.5-8.0 ppm).\n        *   **Acetyl Group Protons:** The acetyl group (-COCH3) has three protons on its methyl group. These three protons are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (a methyl ketone) is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the predicted spectrum with the given options.**\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** Two doublets (each 2H) in the 7.5-8.0 ppm region, and one singlet (3H) in the 2.1-2.6 ppm region.\n    *   **Option A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This is exactly the pattern we expect for the aromatic protons in a *para*-disubstituted ring (two doublets, each for 2H). The chemical shifts are appropriate.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons at a chemical shift perfect for the methyl of an acetyl group.\n        *   This option perfectly matches our prediction.\n    *   **Option B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts (4.8 and 4.6 ppm) are too low for aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **Option C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum shows signals outside the aromatic region and has incorrect integration and multiplicity for our structure. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **Option D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. The problem implies a ketone (the acetyl group, -COCH3) based on the carbon count. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a *para*-haloacetophenone, and its 1H NMR spectrum is best described by option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Information Provided:**\n    *   **Molecular Composition:** The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Core Structure:** It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring with two groups attached to it. A benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen atom directly bonded to the aromatic ring, Ar-X) is confirmed.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We start with the benzene ring (C6). This leaves 2 carbon atoms (8 total - 6 ring = 2) for the two substituents.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contains no carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and simple chemical group that fits this description is the acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Combining these parts, the molecule must be a haloacetophenone. The chemical formula would be C8H7XO.\n\n3.  **Analyze Isomers and Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two substituents (halogen and acetyl group) can be arranged in ortho, meta, or para positions on the benzene ring.\n    *   Let's consider the *para* isomer (p-haloacetophenone). Due to symmetry, the four protons on the aromatic ring are chemically equivalent in pairs. This results in a characteristic A₂B₂ (or AA'BB') splitting pattern in the 1H NMR spectrum, which typically appears as two distinct doublets. Each doublet would integrate to 2 protons (2H).\n    *   The acetyl group (-COCH3) is strongly electron-withdrawing, which will deshield the adjacent aromatic protons (shift them downfield). Halogens are also electron-withdrawing but are pi-donors, so their effect is often less pronounced than a carbonyl group. The aromatic protons will appear in the typical range of δ 7.0-8.0 ppm.\n    *   The methyl group (-CH3) of the acetyl substituent is attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, the methyl protons will appear as a sharp singlet (no adjacent protons to couple with). It will integrate to 3 protons (3H). Its typical chemical shift is around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n    *   In summary, for *p*-haloacetophenone, we expect to see:\n        *   Two doublets in the aromatic region (e.g., ~δ 7.5-8.0 ppm), each for 2H.\n        *   One singlet in the aliphatic region (e.g., ~δ 2.3 ppm) for 3H.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum completely lacks signals in the aromatic proton region (δ 7-8 ppm). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The integrations and multiplicities are inconsistent with the proposed structure. A 2H singlet is not plausible. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d)` and `δ 7.6 (2H, d)`: This is the classic A₂B₂ pattern for a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The integration (2H + 2H = 4H aromatic protons) is correct. The chemical shifts are in the expected downfield region.\n        *   `δ 2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet integrating to 3H, which is a perfect match for the methyl protons of an acetyl group. The chemical shift is also characteristic.\n        *   This data perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for *p*-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This suggests the carbonyl group is an aldehyde. A possible structure could be 4-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde, which has 8 carbons. However, this structure has a *benzylic*-halogen bond (Ar-CH₂-X), not the required *aromatic*-halogen bond (Ar-X). Another possibility, 4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde, has an Ar-X bond but would show different splitting patterns (the aldehyde and CH₂ protons would couple to each other, not be singlets). Thus, this option does not match the compound described.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only NMR data that is fully consistent with a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring containing 8 carbon atoms, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond is option C. The compound is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core structure is a benzene ring with two groups attached (substituents). A benzene ring (C6H6) provides 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 total C - 6 ring C = 2 substituent C).\n    *   **FTIR: Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl group.\n    *   **FTIR: Aromatic-halogen bond:** One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have one halogen substituent (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The most common and stable chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3). It has exactly two carbons and a carbonyl group.\n    *   So, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The general structure is a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom and one acetyl group. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Possibilities based on Isomers:**\n    *   The compound is di-substituted, so it can exist as ortho (1,2-), meta (1,3-), or para (1,4-) isomers. The 1H NMR spectrum will be different for each.\n    *   **Protons on the methyl group (-CH3):** This methyl group is attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, the methyl protons will not be split by any neighbors. They will appear as a **singlet (s)** and will represent 3 hydrogens (**3H**). The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around **2.0-2.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Protons on the aromatic ring:** There are 4 protons on the disubstituted ring. Their appearance depends on the substitution pattern.\n        *   **Ortho and Meta isomers:** These arrangements are less symmetrical. They would typically produce complex spectra with three or four distinct signals in the aromatic region (roughly 7.0-8.0 ppm), often with complex splitting (e.g., triplets, doublets of doublets).\n        *   **Para isomer (1,4-disubstituted):** This arrangement is highly symmetrical. There are only two chemically different types of aromatic protons. The two protons ortho to the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the halogen are equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other. This results in a characteristic pattern of **two doublets (d)** in the aromatic region. Each doublet would integrate to **2H**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Data Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons in the expected region for an acetyl methyl group. This matches our prediction.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: These are two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2 protons. This perfectly matches the pattern expected for a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   This option is a perfect fit for 4-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. This contradicts the likely structure derived from the carbon count. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals at `4.8` and `4.6 ppm` are not in the typical range for aromatic protons (which are usually > 6.5 ppm). This spectrum does not represent the proposed aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum completely lacks signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). It cannot be the spectrum of an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only option that matches all the structural information (8 carbons, disubstituted aromatic ring, carbonyl, halogen) is A. The spectrum is characteristic of a para-substituted acetophenone derivative.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This implies a benzene ring with two groups attached, having the general formula R1-C6H4-R2.\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents (R1 and R2) must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...carbonyl group (C=O)\"**: One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly bonded to the aromatic ring. Let's call this -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   We have one halogen substituent (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain a carbonyl group and the remaining 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   Let's list the possibilities for a C2 substituent with a C=O group:\n        *   **Acetyl group**: -C(=O)CH3. This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl.\n        *   **Formylmethyl group**: -CH2CHO. This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl (from the aldehyde).\n        *   Other possibilities like carboxylic acid (-COOH) only have one carbon, and esters (-COOR) would likely have more than 2 carbons unless R is a proton (which is a carboxylic acid).\n\n3.  **Propose Candidate Molecular Structures:**\n    Based on the above, we have two main structural possibilities:\n    *   **Structure 1**: A benzene ring substituted with a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3). This is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n    *   **Structure 2**: A benzene ring substituted with a halogen (-X) and a formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO). This is a **(halophenyl)acetaldehyde**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Options and Predict Spectra for Candidate Structures:**\n    The options present chemical shifts (δ in ppm), integration (number of protons, e.g., 1H), and multiplicity (singlet (s), doublet (d), etc.).\n\n    *   **Option A) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at **δ 9.9 (1H, s)** is highly characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**. This strongly suggests Structure 2.\n        *   The two doublets at **δ 7.8 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.6 (2H, d)** are a classic signature of a **para (1,4) substituted benzene ring**.\n        *   The peak at **δ 3.7 (2H, s)** is consistent with a **methylene group (-CH2-)** that is benzylic (attached to the ring) and also alpha to a carbonyl group, which both cause a downfield shift.\n        *   **Let's see if this matches Structure 2:** The proposed structure would be **2-(4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n            *   Aldehyde proton (-CHO): Yes, at ~9.9 ppm.\n            *   Methylene protons (-CH2-): Yes, at ~3.7 ppm.\n            *   Para-substituted aromatic protons: Yes, at ~7.8 and ~7.6 ppm.\n            *   *Note on multiplicity*: Technically, the CH2 and CHO protons should couple, resulting in a doublet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CHO. However, this coupling (J-value) is often small (~2-3 Hz) and may not be resolved, causing the peaks to appear as singlets. This is a common simplification in spectroscopy problems. All the chemical shifts and integrations match this structure perfectly.\n\n    *   **Option C) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks the downfield aldehyde peak seen in A.\n        *   The two doublets at **δ 7.8 and 7.6** again suggest a **para-substituted benzene ring**.\n        *   The peak at **δ 2.3 (3H, s)** corresponds to a **methyl group (-CH3)**.\n        *   **Let's see if this matches Structure 1:** The proposed structure would be **4-haloacetophenone**.\n            *   This structure has aromatic protons (4H) and methyl protons (3H), totaling 7 protons, which matches the integration in option C (2H + 2H + 3H = 7H).\n            *   However, the chemical shift for an acetyl methyl group (-COCH3) is typically around **δ 2.5-2.6 ppm**. The value of **δ 2.3 ppm** is unusually low and is more characteristic of a methyl group directly attached to the benzene ring (a tolyl group), which does not contain a carbonyl. This significant discrepancy in chemical shift makes this option less likely.\n\n    *   **Options B) and D)**: These can be quickly eliminated. The chemical shifts (e.g., 4.8, 4.6, 1.3 ppm) are not in the typical range for aromatic protons (which are usually > 6.5 ppm). They do not describe a di-substituted benzene ring.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Option A provides a set of data that is an excellent match for 2-(4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde. The key diagnostic peaks—the aldehyde proton at 9.9 ppm and the benzylic methylene at 3.7 ppm—are at their expected chemical shifts. The aromatic pattern also fits. The only minor discrepancy is the simplified multiplicity, which is acceptable.\n    Option C corresponds to 4-haloacetophenone, but the chemical shift for the methyl group (2.3 ppm) is incorrect for an acetyl group (expected ~2.6 ppm).\n\nTherefore, the data in option A is the correct identification for the described compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6) with two groups attached.\n    *   **Total Carbon Atoms:** 8. The benzene ring itself contains 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows the presence of:\n        *   A carbonyl group (C=O).\n        *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X), meaning a halogen atom is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the molecular structure:**\n    *   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). A halogen atom has 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both the carbonyl group and the 2 required carbon atoms. The simplest and most common functional group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   So, the molecule is a haloacetophenone. Its general structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n\n3.  **Analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for this structure:**\n    *   The molecule has a methyl group (-CH₃) and aromatic protons (-C₆H₄-).\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The methyl group is attached to a carbonyl group. It has no adjacent protons, so it will appear as a **singlet (s)**. It corresponds to **3 hydrogens (3H)**. The chemical shift for a methyl ketone is typically in the range of 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (-C₆H₄-):** A di-substituted benzene ring has **4 aromatic protons (4H)**. Their splitting pattern depends on the positions of the substituents (ortho, meta, or para).\n        *   **Ortho (1,2-substitution):** Would show a complex multiplet for the 4 aromatic protons.\n        *   **Meta (1,3-substitution):** Would also show a complex pattern, likely with 4 distinct signals.\n        *   **Para (1,4-substitution):** Due to the high symmetry of the molecule, there are only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons. This results in a very characteristic pattern: **two doublets (d)**, with each doublet integrating to **2 hydrogens (2H)**. The chemical shift for aromatic protons is typically between 6.5 and 8.5 ppm. Protons closer to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group will be further downfield (higher ppm value).\n\n4.  **Evaluate the given options against the expected spectrum:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This option lacks any signals in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are too low. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The integration values (1H, 2H, 2H, 2H) do not match our expected pattern of 4H (aromatic) and 3H (methyl). The signal at 1.3 ppm is a singlet for 2H, not 3H. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** This is a perfect match for a para-substituted aromatic ring. Two doublets, each for 2 protons, totaling 4 aromatic protons. The chemical shifts are in the correct aromatic region.\n        *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is a singlet for 3 protons at a chemical shift characteristic of an acetyl methyl group.\n        *   This option perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**, not a methyl ketone. If the compound were an aldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CHO), it would only have 7 carbon atoms, which contradicts the problem statement. This is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C is the only one that fits the description of the compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Structure Core:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This most commonly means a benzene ring with two substituents, with the formula C6H4.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The compound contains 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbons.\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This means one of the substituents on the aromatic ring is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I).\n\n**2. Deduce the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   We have a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible structures for a C2 substituent containing a C=O group:\n    *   **-C(O)CH3 (acetyl group):** This is a very common and stable group. It consists of a carbonyl bonded to a methyl group.\n    *   **-CH2CHO (2-oxoethyl group):** This consists of a methylene group (-CH2-) attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   Combining these substituents with the C6H4 core, we get two primary candidate molecules:\n    1.  **Haloacetophenone:** The structure is X-C6H4-C(O)CH3. It has 8 carbons, a di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl, and an Ar-X bond.\n    2.  **(Halophenyl)acetaldehyde:** The structure is X-C6H4-CH2CHO. It also has 8 carbons, a di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl, and an Ar-X bond.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectra for the Candidate Structures**\n\nThe provided NMR options B and C show a pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, which is a classic fingerprint for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. This symmetry simplifies the spectrum, so let's assume this substitution pattern for our predictions.\n\n*   **Prediction for para-Haloacetophenone (Structure 1: p-X-C6H4-C(O)CH3)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons on the ring. Due to para-substitution, they are divided into two chemically equivalent sets. This results in two signals, each integrating to 2 protons. They are adjacent, so they will split each other into doublets (d). The carbonyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it will be downfield (higher ppm). Expected signals: ~7.8-8.0 ppm (2H, d) and ~7.4-7.7 ppm (2H, d).\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, they will not be split and will appear as a singlet (s). The typical chemical shift is around 2.5 ppm. Expected signal: ~2.5 ppm (3H, s).\n    *   **Summary prediction:** Two doublets in the aromatic region (2H each) and one singlet in the aliphatic region (3H).\n\n*   **Prediction for para-(Halophenyl)acetaldehyde (Structure 2: p-X-C6H4-CH2CHO)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** Similar to the above, we expect two doublets (d) for the 4 aromatic protons, each integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** The aldehyde proton is highly deshielded and appears far downfield. It is adjacent to the -CH2- group (2 protons), so it should be split into a triplet (t) by the rule n+1 (2+1=3). Expected signal: ~9.5-10.0 ppm (1H, t).\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-):** These two protons are adjacent to the single aldehyde proton. They will be split into a doublet (d) by the rule n+1 (1+1=2). Their chemical shift would be around 3.7 ppm. Expected signal: ~3.7 ppm (2H, d).\n    *   **Summary prediction:** Two doublets in the aromatic region (2H each), one doublet in the aliphatic region (2H), and one triplet at a very high chemical shift (1H).\n\n**4. Compare Predictions with the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), ... 1.3 (2H, s)**: This data is inconsistent. It only shows one aromatic proton, and the integration of the singlet at 1.3 ppm is unusual. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**:\n    *   Aromatic region: 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d). This matches our prediction for a para-disubstituted ring.\n    *   Aliphatic region: 2.3 ppm (3H, s). This is a methyl singlet.\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches the prediction for **para-haloacetophenone**. All features (integrations, chemical shifts, and splitting patterns) are correct.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**:\n    *   This spectrum has the characteristic aldehyde proton peak at 9.9 ppm and the methylene peak at 3.7 ppm, suggesting the (halophenyl)acetaldehyde structure.\n    *   **However, the splitting patterns are incorrect.** The aldehyde proton is listed as a singlet (s) instead of a triplet (t), and the methylene protons are listed as a singlet (s) instead of a doublet (d). This indicates an absence of the expected coupling between these adjacent protons, which is chemically implausible under normal conditions.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**: This option lists no signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). A di-substituted aromatic ring must have aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption B is the only choice that describes a chemically correct and self-consistent 1H NMR spectrum that corresponds to a molecule (para-haloacetophenone) fitting all the structural and spectroscopic information given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (which has 6 carbons) with two substituents attached. The core formula of this part is C6H4.\n*   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the benzene ring. A halogen atom contains zero carbon atoms.\n\nBased on this, we can deduce the two substituents:\n*   Substituent 1: A halogen (-X). This accounts for 0 of the 2 carbons.\n*   Substituent 2: A group that contains the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable chemical group fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n\nSo, the molecule is an **acetophenone** with a halogen substituent on the aromatic ring. The general structure is **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO. Let's check the proton count: 4 protons on the aromatic ring and 3 protons on the methyl group, for a total of 7 protons.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the Proposed Structure**\n\nThe structure has two main parts that will give signals in the 1H NMR spectrum:\n*   **The acetyl group (-COCH3)**: The three methyl protons (-CH3) are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **singlet (s)**. Since there are three of them, the integration will be **3H**. The chemical shift for protons of a methyl group next to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone) is typically in the range of **2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n*   **The aromatic protons**: There are 4 protons on the di-substituted benzene ring. Their chemical shift and splitting pattern depend on the relative positions of the two substituents (*ortho*, *meta*, or *para*).\n    *   Both the halogen (-X) and the acetyl (-COCH3) groups are electron-withdrawing, which means they will de-shield the aromatic protons, causing them to appear at a relatively high chemical shift (downfield), typically in the **7.0-8.5 ppm** range.\n    *   Let's consider the splitting pattern for the most common isomers:\n        *   ***para* (1,4) substitution**: The molecule has a plane of symmetry. This makes the two protons next to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons next to the halogen equivalent to each other. This results in two signals in the aromatic region. Each signal is split by its one neighbor, resulting in two **doublets (d)**. The integration for each doublet will be **2H**. This pattern (two doublets, each 2H) is a classic fingerprint for *para*-disubstitution.\n        *   ***ortho* (1,2) or *meta* (1,3) substitution**: These isomers lack the symmetry of the *para* isomer. All four aromatic protons would be chemically distinct, leading to a much more complex spectrum with four separate signals (e.g., doublets, triplets, multiplets), each with an integration of 1H.\n\n**3. Compare the Predicted Spectrum with the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's analyze the choices:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s)**: This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches the methyl group of our acetyl substituent (-COCH**3**).\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d)**: These are two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. This pattern is the hallmark of a *para*-substituted benzene ring. The chemical shifts are appropriately downfield due to the electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   This option is an excellent match for **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical range for aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring should have 4 aromatic protons. This data shows only one proton in the aromatic region (6.9 ppm). This is inconsistent.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO), not a ketone. The deduced structure is a ketone (-COCH3). This is a fundamental mismatch.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A is the only one that matches all the structural features deduced from the problem description. The compound is a *para*-haloacetophenone, and the provided 1H NMR data correctly describes it with a singlet for the methyl ketone and two doublets for the *para*-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information Provided:**\n\n*   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents attached.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** A total of 8 carbon atoms. A benzene ring contains 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must have 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond is present, meaning a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   Based on the information, we have a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining two carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   The most common and stable chemical group that fits the description \"2 carbons and a carbonyl group\" is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n*   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. Its general structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n*   Let's check the carbon count: 6 carbons in the ring + 2 carbons in the acetyl group = 8 carbons total. This is correct.\n*   Let's check the functional groups: We have an aromatic-halogen bond (X-C₆) and a carbonyl group (in -COCH₃). This is also correct.\n\n**3. Analyze the Isomers and Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\nThe two substituents (-X and -COCH₃) can be arranged in three possible positions on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4). The 1H NMR spectrum will be different for each isomer.\n\n*   **Ortho and Meta Isomers:** In these isomers, all four protons on the benzene ring are chemically non-equivalent. This would result in a complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region (typically 4 different signals, likely multiplets).\n*   **Para Isomer (1,4-disubstitution):** This isomer is symmetrical. The four protons on the benzene ring are chemically equivalent in two pairs.\n    *   This high symmetry leads to a much simpler and very characteristic 1H NMR pattern for the aromatic region: **two doublets**, with each doublet integrating to **2 protons**.\n    *   The acetyl group (-COCH₃) contains a methyl group with three equivalent protons. Since the adjacent atom (the carbonyl carbon) has no protons, this methyl group will appear as a **singlet** integrating to **3 protons**. The chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl is typically around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   The aromatic protons are deshielded and will appear further downfield, typically in the **7.0-8.0 ppm** range.\n\n**Summary of Predicted Spectrum for p-Haloacetophenone:**\n*   A singlet (3H) around 2.3 ppm.\n*   A doublet (2H) in the aromatic region.\n*   Another doublet (2H) in the aromatic region.\n\n**4. Compare the Prediction with the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts are incorrect. 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are too low for aromatic protons. 1.3 ppm is too low for an acetyl methyl group.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a ketone. The compound described has a ketone (in the acetyl group). This option is inconsistent with the deduced structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The integration and splitting patterns are incorrect. A di-substituted ring should have 4 aromatic protons, but this option only accounts for 1 aromatic proton (6.9 ppm, s).\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, is the classic signature of a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The chemical shifts are appropriate for aromatic protons.\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is a singlet for 3 protons at a chemical shift characteristic of an acetyl methyl group.\n    *   This option perfectly matches our predicted spectrum for a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is a para-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data provided in option D is the only one that correctly describes this structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information about the compound:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents.\n    *   **Molecular Formula Hint:** It contains 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbons (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **FTIR Data:**\n        *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n        *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Propose a plausible structure:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring with two substituents.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   A functional group that fits this description perfectly is the acetyl group (-COCH₃). It has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃). This structure has 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8 carbon atoms, a carbonyl group, an aromatic-halogen bond, and is di-substituted.\n\n3.  **Determine the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para):**\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum provides clues about the relative positions of the substituents. Let's analyze the aromatic region of the given options.\n    *   A para (1,4) substituted benzene ring with two different groups typically shows a symmetrical pattern in the aromatic region: two distinct signals, each appearing as a doublet, and each integrating to 2 protons. This is due to the plane of symmetry through the C1-C4 axis.\n    *   Ortho (1,2) and meta (1,3) substitutions usually result in more complex splitting patterns with four distinct signals (or overlapping multiplets) for the four aromatic protons.\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the proposed structure (4-haloacetophenone):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C₆H₄):** Assuming para-substitution (which gives the simplest and most recognizable pattern), we expect two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). Each doublet would correspond to 2 protons. The protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group (-COCH₃) would be more deshielded and appear at a higher chemical shift (further downfield) than the protons adjacent to the halogen. So, we'd expect something like: **~7.8 ppm (2H, d)** and **~7.6 ppm (2H, d)**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-COCH₃):** The three protons of the methyl group are attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, this signal will be a **singlet (s)**. Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 2.1-2.6 ppm. The integration will be for **3 hydrogens (3H)**. So we'd expect: **~2.3 ppm (3H, s)**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the given options against the prediction:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a methyl ketone (-COCH₃). This contradicts our most likely structure.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical aromatic proton region (6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the correct spectrum for an aromatic compound.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). This perfectly matches the expected pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** 2.3 (3H, s). This perfectly matches the expected signal for an acetyl methyl group.\n        *   This option is an excellent match for the predicted spectrum of 4-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum shows only one proton in the aromatic region (6.9 ppm, 1H), which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which should have 4 aromatic protons).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is a 4-haloacetophenone. Its 1H NMR spectrum consists of two doublets in the aromatic region for the four ring protons and a singlet in the aliphatic region for the three methyl protons. Option C is the only one that matches this description.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n**1. Decode the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents attached. The base formula for this part is C₆H₄.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This is a crucial piece of information. It means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring. So, one of the substituents is simply a halogen, -X.\n\n**2. Combine the Structural Pieces**\n\n*   We know one substituent is a halogen (-X). Halogens do not contain any carbon atoms.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent must account for both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms AND the carbonyl group.\n*   The most common and logical chemical group that fits the description of having 2 carbons and a carbonyl group is an **acetyl group**: -C(=O)CH₃.\n\n**3. Propose the Final Structure**\n\n*   Combining all the pieces, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The two substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n*   The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO. The number of protons is 4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group, for a total of **7 protons**.\n\n**4. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum and Compare with Options**\n\nNow, we need to consider the possible isomers (*ortho*, *meta*, *para*) and predict their general 1H NMR patterns.\n\n*   **Key signals to look for**:\n    *   A singlet for the 3 protons of the methyl group (-CH₃), deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl. This signal should appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm.\n    *   Signals for the 4 protons on the aromatic ring, in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). The splitting pattern will depend on the substitution pattern.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum is inconsistent. It lacks the characteristic 3H singlet for an acetyl group's methyl protons. Instead, it has a 2H singlet at 1.3 ppm. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The singlet at 9.9 ppm is a definitive sign of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not an acetyl group. Although this structure could have 8 carbons (e.g., p-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde, CH₂(X)-C₆H₄-CHO), the halogen would be on the methyl group, not the aromatic ring. This contradicts the \"aromatic-halogen bond\" information from the FTIR.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Proton count**: 2H + 2H + 3H = 7H. This matches our expected total number of protons.\n    *   **Methyl signal**: There is a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm. This is a perfect match for the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n    *   **Aromatic signals**: There are two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. This clean pattern of two doublets is highly characteristic of a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring.\n    *   **Conclusion for C**: This data perfectly describes *para*-haloacetophenone. All conditions are met: 8 carbons, a di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, an aromatic-halogen bond, and the correct NMR signals and splitting pattern.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum has no signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the correct data for an aromatic compound.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence strongly points to the compound being *para*-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data provided in option C is a classic textbook example of such a molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **Molecular Framework:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring with two substituents. A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms (C6).\n    *   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The molecule has a total of 8 carbon atoms. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n        *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl group.\n        *   **Aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** A halogen atom (like F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring. This means one of the two substituents is simply a halogen atom (-X).\n\n2.  **Deduce the Structure:**\n    *   We have established that the two substituents on the benzene ring are:\n        1.  A halogen atom (-X).\n        2.  A substituent containing 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n    *   Let's figure out the second substituent. A group with 2 carbons and a C=O can be an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Combining these pieces, the molecule must be a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7OX. This structure fits all the initial criteria.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Options based on the Deduced Structure:**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring can be *ortho* (1,2-), *meta* (1,3-), or *para* (1,4-). Each substitution pattern gives a characteristic set of signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n    *   The proposed structure is a haloacetophenone. Let's examine the expected NMR signals. The molecule has two types of protons: aromatic protons on the ring and aliphatic protons on the acetyl group's methyl part.\n    *   **Protons on the acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. It has 3 protons and no adjacent protons, so it will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its chemical shift is typically around 2.2-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Protons on the aromatic ring:** There are 4 protons on the di-substituted ring.\n        *   If the substitution is **para (1,4-)**, the molecule is symmetric. There are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This symmetry results in a very clean and characteristic pattern of **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. This is often referred to as an AA'BB' system.\n        *   If the substitution is *ortho* or *meta*, the spectrum would be more complex, typically showing four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic region:** `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This is the classic pattern for a **para-substituted** aromatic ring. It accounts for the 4 aromatic protons.\n        *   **Aliphatic region:** `2.3 (3H, s)`. This is a singlet for 3 protons, which perfectly matches an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This spectrum is fully consistent with the structure of **p-haloacetophenone**. All features match our deduced structure.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum shows only one aromatic proton (`6.9 (1H, s)`), which contradicts the presence of a di-substituted benzene ring (which must have 4 aromatic protons). This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum has **no signals** in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). Therefore, it cannot represent an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**.\n        *   The aromatic signals `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` indicate **para-substitution**.\n        *   The signal at `3.7 (2H, s)` corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n        *   This data would correspond to a structure like *p*-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde. The total carbons would be C6 (ring) + C1 (aldehyde) + C1 (methyl) = 8 carbons. This fits the carbon count and the carbonyl group requirement.\n        *   **Crucial Flaw:** In this proposed structure, the halogen is attached to the methyl group (-CH2X), which is an *aliphatic*-halogen bond, not an *aromatic*-halogen bond (Ar-X) as specified by the FTIR data. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nOption A is the only choice that is perfectly consistent with all the provided information: an 8-carbon, di-substituted aromatic ring containing a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond, showing the characteristic 1H NMR signals for a *para*-substituted acetophenone derivative.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the given information:**\n\n*   **Molecular Structure:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it is a benzene ring with two groups attached, having the general formula C6H4(Substituent 1)(Substituent 2).\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring itself contains 6 carbons, the two substituents must collectively contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) bonded directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Structure of the Compound:**\n\n*   Let's identify the two substituents.\n    *   Substituent 1 is a Halogen (let's call it -X). It contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   Substituent 2 must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable arrangement for a C2 unit with a carbonyl is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n\n*   Combining these pieces, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The structure consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen atom (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n*   The molecular formula would be C8H7XO (where X is a halogen). Let's count the protons: The benzene ring starts with 6 protons. Replacing two with substituents leaves 4 aromatic protons. The acetyl group's methyl (-CH3) has 3 protons. So, the total number of protons is 4 + 3 = 7.\n\n**3. Analyze the Substitution Pattern and Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\nThe two substituents can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n\n*   **Ortho- and Meta-substitution:** These patterns would result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, leading to a complex multiplet in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum (typically between δ 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n*   **Para-substitution (1,4):** This pattern creates a plane of symmetry in the molecule. The two protons ortho to the acetyl group are chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the halogen are also chemically equivalent. This simplification results in a characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: two signals, each integrating to 2 protons. Due to coupling with their neighbors, these signals typically appear as two distinct **doublets**.\n\nThe acetyl group's methyl protons (-CH3) are attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, these 3 protons will appear as a **singlet**.\n\n**Predicted Spectrum for a 4-haloacetophenone:**\n*   Aromatic region: Two doublets, each for 2H.\n*   Aliphatic region: One singlet, for 3H.\n*   Total Protons: 2 + 2 + 3 = 7.\n\n**4. Compare the Prediction with the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Pattern:** This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) and a singlet in the aliphatic region (2.3 ppm). This perfectly matches the pattern predicted for a para-substituted haloacetophenone.\n    *   **Integration:** 2H + 2H + 3H = 7 protons. This matches our calculated proton count.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The signals at δ 7.8 and δ 7.6 are in the expected region for an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups. The signal at δ 2.3 is a reasonable chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone). This option is a strong candidate.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at δ 9.9 is characteristic of an **aldehyde** (-CHO). An aldehyde group contains only one carbon. If the substituents were an aldehyde and a halogen, the total carbon count would be 6 (ring) + 1 (aldehyde) = 7, which contradicts the given total of 8 carbons. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only shows one proton at δ 6.9, and it's a singlet. This is inconsistent with the required structure. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum has **no signals in the aromatic region** (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm). Therefore, it cannot represent an aromatic compound. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly Option A provides a 1H NMR spectrum that is fully consistent with the structural features deduced from the problem statement: an 8-carbon, di-substituted aromatic compound containing a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond (specifically, a para-haloacetophenone).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\n*   **Step 1: Decode the information from the problem statement to deduce the molecular structure.**\n    1.  **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents.\n    2.  **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    3.  **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group. A carbonyl group has one carbon atom.\n    4.  **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring. A halogen is not a carbon atom.\n    5.  **Putting it all together**: We have a benzene ring substituted with a halogen (-X) and another substituent that contains the remaining two carbons and the carbonyl group. The only common and stable group that fits this is an acetyl group (-COCH₃). This substituent has two carbons and a carbonyl group.\n    6.  **The compound's structure**: The compound is a haloacetophenone. The general formula is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃. Since it is di-substituted, it can be the *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* isomer.\n\n*   **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for the deduced structure and compare it with the given options.**\n    *   The structure X-C₆H₄-COCH₃ has two types of protons: those on the aromatic ring and those on the methyl group.\n    *   **Methyl protons (-COCH₃)**: These three protons are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Therefore, they will appear as a single sharp signal, a **singlet (s)**, with an integration of **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone) is around 2.0 - 2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Aromatic protons (-C₆H₄-)**: There are four protons on the ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern (*ortho*, *meta*, or *para*).\n        *   An *ortho* or *meta* substitution pattern would result in four distinct aromatic protons, leading to a complex multiplet in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n        *   A *para* (1,4) substitution pattern results in a highly symmetric molecule. There are only two types of aromatic protons, each group having two equivalent protons. This gives a characteristic pattern of **two doublets (d)** in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm), with each doublet integrating to **2H**. The two doublets arise from the mutual splitting of the two adjacent, non-equivalent proton sets.\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the given ¹H NMR data options.**\n    *   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This matches the predicted signal for the methyl group (-COCH₃) perfectly in terms of chemical shift, integration, and multiplicity.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, in the aromatic region is the classic signature of a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield position (7.6-7.8 ppm) is consistent with protons on a ring attached to two electron-withdrawing groups (halogen and acetyl).\n        *   This option is a perfect match for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals at 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are not in the typical aromatic region. The integration for the upfield singlet (2H) is incorrect for a methyl group. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. While a molecule like *para*-halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO) would fit the carbon count and FTIR data, the multiplicity given is incorrect. The aldehyde proton (-CHO) and the adjacent methylene protons (-CH₂-) would split each other, resulting in a triplet and a doublet, respectively, not two singlets. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.0 ppm), which is impossible for the described compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion**: Option A is the only one that correctly represents the ¹H NMR spectrum for a compound fitting all the described characteristics. The compound is a *para*-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core structure is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents. The substitution can be *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4).\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl functional group.\n    *   **FTIR shows an aromatic-halogen bond:** One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). It has 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. Let's list the possibilities for a 2-carbon group containing a carbonyl:\n        *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This group has 2 carbons and a carbonyl. This is a very common substituent.\n        *   **Formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO):** This group has 2 carbons and a carbonyl (aldehyde). This is also a possibility.\n        *   **Carboxy group (-COOH) is not possible** as it only has 1 carbon. An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) would have 3 carbons.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Possible Molecular Structures:**\n    Based on the above, the molecule must be a halo-substituted benzene ring with either an acetyl or a formylmethyl group.\n    *   **Structure I:** A halo-acetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n    *   **Structure II:** A halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n\n4.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data in the Options:**\n    The key to distinguishing the correct structure and its isomerism (*ortho*, *meta*, *para*) is the 1H NMR spectrum. Let's focus on the aromatic region first.\n    *   Options **A** and **B** both show an aromatic region with two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons: `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This AA'BB' splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a **para (1,4) substituted** benzene ring.\n    *   Options C and D lack the typical signals for aromatic protons (which are usually found > 6.5 ppm) and have unusual patterns, so they can be confidently eliminated.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Two Remaining Possibilities (Para-substituted isomers):**\n    We are now choosing between the 1H NMR spectra for `p-halo-acetophenone` and `p-halo-phenylacetaldehyde`.\n\n    *   **Possibility 1: Corresponds to Option B (p-halo-acetophenone)**\n        *   **Structure:** A halogen and an acetyl group (-COCH3) are in a para-arrangement on the benzene ring.\n        *   **Expected Spectrum:**\n            *   **Aromatic protons:** A para-substituted ring with an electron-withdrawing group like -COCH3 gives two doublets, typically between 7.4-8.0 ppm. This matches `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`.\n            *   **Acetyl protons (-COCH3):** A methyl group attached to a carbonyl gives a singlet (no adjacent protons) for 3H. The typical chemical shift is ~2.1-2.6 ppm.\n        *   **Option B:** `1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`. This spectrum is a very good match for the p-halo-acetophenone structure.\n\n    *   **Possibility 2: Corresponds to Option A (p-halo-phenylacetaldehyde)**\n        *   **Structure:** A halogen and a formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO) are in a para-arrangement on the benzene ring.\n        *   **Expected Spectrum:**\n            *   **Aromatic protons:** The -CH2CHO group is not directly conjugated with the ring. Its electron-withdrawing effect is weaker (inductive only) than a directly attached carbonyl. Therefore, the aromatic protons would be expected at a lower chemical shift (more upfield) compared to acetophenone.\n            *   **Aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is highly deshielded and gives a signal at ~9-10 ppm.\n            *   **Methylene protons (-CH2-):** These protons are benzylic and adjacent to an aldehyde, typically appearing around ~3.5-4.0 ppm.\n        *   **Option A:** `1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`. While the aldehyde (9.9 ppm) and methylene (3.7 ppm) shifts are plausible, the aromatic shifts (7.8, 7.6 ppm) are too far downfield. A non-conjugated group like -CH2CHO would result in aromatic signals closer to 7.2-7.4 ppm. The strong deshielding to 7.6-7.8 ppm indicates a powerful, directly conjugated electron-withdrawing group like the ketone in acetophenone.\n\n6.  **Search for Reference Data (Confirmation):**\n    To confirm this reasoning, we can look up typical values.\n    *   The 1H NMR of `p-bromoacetophenone` shows signals at ~7.80 ppm (d, 2H), ~7.61 ppm (d, 2H), and ~2.59 ppm (s, 3H). This is an excellent match for the pattern and chemical shifts in Option B.\n    *   The 1H NMR of `p-chlorophenylacetaldehyde` shows signals at ~7.3 ppm (d, 2H), ~7.2 ppm (d, 2H), ~9.7 ppm (t, 1H), and ~3.6 ppm (d, 2H). The aromatic shifts here are significantly different from what is given in Option A.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The NMR data in Option B is highly consistent with the structure of a `p-halo-acetophenone`. The aromatic shifts, integration, and multiplicity strongly support a para-substituted ring with a conjugated carbonyl group. The signal at 2.3 ppm represents the methyl of the acetyl group.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Decipher the Compound's Structure from the Description**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two groups attached to it. A benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms and, when di-substituted, 4 hydrogen atoms attached to the ring (C6H4).\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) as well as an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)\"**: This tells us about the functional groups present. One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. The other substituent must contain the two carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n\n**2. Assemble the Substituents**\n\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must have the formula C2O. A very common and stable chemical group that fits this description is the acetyl group: -COCH3.\n*   Let's check other possibilities for a 2-carbon carbonyl-containing group. Another option is -CH2CHO.\n\n**3. Propose Candidate Structures**\n\n*   **Structure 1 (from -COCH3 substituent): Haloacetophenone.**\n    *   This compound consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen and an acetyl group.\n    *   Total carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. This matches.\n    *   It has the required functional groups (Ar-X, C=O).\n\n*   **Structure 2 (from -CH2CHO substituent): (Halophenyl)acetaldehyde.**\n    *   This compound consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen and a -CH2CHO group.\n    *   Total carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (-CH2CHO) = 8. This also matches.\n    *   It has the required functional groups (Ar-X, C=O).\n\n**4. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Structure and Compare with Options**\n\nLet's analyze the expected signals for each structure. The substitution can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4). The provided options show a simple pattern (two doublets) in the aromatic region, which is highly characteristic of para (1,4) substitution. We will assume a para-substituted ring.\n\n*   **Prediction for para-Haloacetophenone (Structure 1)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4)**: In a para-disubstituted ring, there are two sets of equivalent protons. This results in two signals, each appearing as a doublet due to splitting by the adjacent proton. Each doublet should integrate to 2H. The chemical shift will be in the aromatic region, typically 7.0-8.0 ppm.\n    *   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH3)**: The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This will result in a singlet signal integrating to 3H. The chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl is typically 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Summary Prediction:**\n        *   ~7-8 ppm (2H, d)\n        *   ~7-8 ppm (2H, d)\n        *   ~2.1-2.6 ppm (3H, s)\n\n*   **Prediction for para-(Halophenyl)acetaldehyde (Structure 2)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4)**: Same as above, two doublets, each integrating to 2H, in the 7.0-8.0 ppm region.\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO)**: The single proton of the aldehyde group is adjacent to the two CH2 protons. It should appear as a triplet. The chemical shift for an aldehyde proton is very distinct, typically 9.5-10.0 ppm.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-)**: The two protons of the methylene group are adjacent to the single aldehyde proton. They should appear as a doublet. The chemical shift for protons on a carbon between a benzene ring and a carbonyl is typically 3.5-4.0 ppm.\n    *   **Summary Prediction:**\n        *   ~9.5-10.0 ppm (1H, t)\n        *   ~7-8 ppm (2H, d)\n        *   ~7-8 ppm (2H, d)\n        *   ~3.5-4.0 ppm (2H, d)\n\n**5. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This matches the chemical shifts for the acetaldehyde structure (aldehyde H at 9.9, aromatic Hs at 7.8/7.6, methylene Hs at 3.7). However, the multiplicities are incorrect. The aldehyde proton should be a triplet (t), not a singlet (s), and the methylene protons should be a doublet (d), not a singlet (s). This option is incorrect due to the inconsistent splitting patterns.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the typical aromatic proton region (7-8 ppm). It is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, which is classic for a para-substituted ring.\n    *   It also shows a singlet integrating to 3H at 2.3 ppm, which is a perfect match for an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   This data perfectly matches our prediction for para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum also lacks signals in the aromatic proton region. It is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe 1H NMR data in option C is the only one that perfectly matches a molecule that satisfies all the conditions described in the problem. The molecule is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two groups attached to it (formula C₆H₄XY).\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring itself contains 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents (X and Y) must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O functional group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's designate this as -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the molecular structure:**\n    *   We have a halogen substituent (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must account for the remaining 2 carbon atoms and contain the carbonyl group.\n    *   The simplest and most common group that fits this description (2 carbons, one carbonyl) is the acetyl group, -COCH₃.\n    *   So, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The two substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃). The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. This fits all the given criteria.\n\n3.  **Analyze the possible isomers and predict the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n    *   The two substituents can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n    *   Let's consider the symmetry of each isomer, as this greatly influences the 1H NMR spectrum:\n        *   **Ortho and Meta isomers**: These are asymmetrical. They would have four distinct signals for the four protons on the aromatic ring, likely resulting in a complex multiplet pattern.\n        *   **Para isomer**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen equivalent to each other.\n    *   **Predicted spectrum for the para isomer (p-haloacetophenone):**\n        *   **Aromatic Region (6.5-8.5 ppm):** We expect two distinct signals for the aromatic protons.\n            *   One signal for the 2 protons next to the acetyl group.\n            *   One signal for the 2 protons next to the halogen.\n            *   Each signal will be a doublet because its protons are coupled to the other set of protons (ortho-coupling).\n            *   Therefore, the aromatic region should show two doublets, each integrating to 2H.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** We have the acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n            *   The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n            *   This will produce a singlet, integrating to 3H. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone (Ar-CO-CH₃) is around 2.2-2.6 ppm.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the given 1H NMR options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, in the aromatic region is the classic signature of a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons, which perfectly corresponds to the methyl group of an acetyl substituent.\n        *   This option perfectly matches our predicted spectrum for p-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not a ketone. The rest of the signals do not fit a simple, logical structure consistent with the prompt.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts `4.8` and `4.6` are not in the typical range for aromatic protons (6.5-8.5 ppm). This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   Again, the signals at `4.8` and `4.6` are not in the aromatic region. This option is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only 1H NMR data that is consistent with the deduced structure of p-haloacetophenone is Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents attached to it. The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring. This halogen atom is one of the two substituents.\n\nLet's assemble the structure:\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The simplest and most common chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃). This group contains a carbonyl (C=O) and two carbons.\n\nSo, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n**2. Analyze the Possible Isomers and their Expected 1H NMR Spectra:**\n\nThe two substituents (-X and -COCH₃) can be arranged in three possible positions on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n\n*   **Protons from the Acetyl Group:** The acetyl group (-COCH₃) has a methyl group. These 3 protons are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will always appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone) is typically around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n\n*   **Protons from the Aromatic Ring:** The benzene ring has 4 protons.\n    *   **Ortho (1,2) and Meta (1,3) Isomers:** In these arrangements, the molecule has low symmetry. The 4 aromatic protons would be chemically non-equivalent and would split each other, resulting in a complex pattern of multiplets (e.g., doublets, triplets, doublet of doublets) in the aromatic region of the spectrum (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm).\n    *   **Para (1,4) Isomer:** This isomer is highly symmetrical. There are only two types of aromatic protons due to a plane of symmetry passing through the two substituents.\n        *   The 2 protons ortho to the acetyl group are equivalent.\n        *   The 2 protons ortho to the halogen group are equivalent.\n        *   Each set of protons splits the other, so the aromatic region will show two distinct **doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n\nNow, let's compare the predicted spectra with the choices provided:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone.\n    *   The singlet at 3.7 ppm integrates to 2H, not 3H, which is inconsistent with an acetyl methyl group. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d):** This pattern perfectly matches the expected signal for the 4 aromatic protons of a para (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. The integration (2H+2H=4H) is correct.\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm, which is exactly what we expect for the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n    *   This option perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for **4-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the typical aromatic proton region (around 7-8 ppm). The chemical shifts and splitting patterns are inconsistent with a haloacetophenone. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   Similar to option C, this spectrum is missing the characteristic aromatic proton signals. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe structure that fits all the information provided is 4-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data in option B is the only one that corresponds to this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\n*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the information provided in the question.**\n    1.  **Molecular Formula information:** The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms. It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The aromatic ring itself (benzene) accounts for 6 carbon atoms (C6). Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 total C - 6 ring C = 2 C).\n    2.  **Functional Group information (from FTIR):**\n        *   A peak indicates a carbonyl group (C=O).\n        *   A peak indicates an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X, where X is a halogen like F, Cl, Br, or I).\n    3.  **Structural deductions:**\n        *   We have a benzene ring with two groups attached (di-substituted).\n        *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X) directly attached to the ring.\n        *   The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms: 2 carbons and 1 oxygen, including a C=O group. The most plausible and common group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n*   **Step 2: Propose the most likely structure.**\n    *   Combining the deductions from Step 1, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The molecular structure consists of a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom and one acetyl group.\n    *   The molecular formula is C8H7XO. This fits all the initial criteria.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR spectral features based on the proposed structure.**\n    *   The structure is a di-substituted benzene ring. This means there are 4 protons on the aromatic ring. The substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para) will determine the splitting pattern of these protons.\n    *   Let's examine the patterns in the options provided, specifically in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n        *   Options B and C show a pattern of `(2H, d)` and `(2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para isomer results in only two distinct types of aromatic protons, which split each other into doublets.\n    *   So, we can refine our proposed structure to be a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Predict the complete 1H NMR spectrum for para-haloacetophenone and compare it with the given options.**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are two sets of equivalent protons.\n        1.  The two protons ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group (-COCH3). These will be deshielded and appear further downfield.\n        2.  The two protons ortho to the halogen atom (-X).\n        *   These two sets split each other, giving two doublets. The integration will be 2H for each doublet. Their chemical shift will be in the range of ~7.5-8.0 ppm.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There is one methyl group (-CH3) from the acetyl substituent.\n        *   These three protons are equivalent.\n        *   They are attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons on it, so they will appear as a **singlet** (no splitting).\n        *   The integration will be 3H.\n        *   The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone (Ar-CO-CH3) is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** ~7.5-8.0 ppm (4H total, split into two doublets of 2H each) and ~2.1-2.6 ppm (3H, singlet).\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the predicted spectrum with the options.**\n    *   A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)\n        *   Incorrect. The chemical shifts are not in the aromatic region.\n    *   B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)\n        *   Incorrect. The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not a ketone. This would correspond to a different structure, and the multiplicities are inconsistent for that structure anyway.\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **This is a perfect match.** It shows the two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons of a para-substituted ring (`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`) and the singlet for the 3 methyl protons of the acetyl group at a characteristic chemical shift (`2.3 (3H, s)`).\n    *   D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)\n        *   Incorrect. The aromatic region is wrong (only 1H), and the other signals do not match.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\n*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the problem statement to deduce the compound's structural features.**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This means we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum... as well as an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the benzene ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\n*   **Step 2: Combine the structural features to propose candidate molecules.**\n    *   We have two substituents on a benzene ring: one is a halogen (-X), and the other must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   Let's figure out the C2 substituent with a carbonyl group. Two possibilities are most common:\n        1.  An **acetyl group** (-COCH3). This has two carbons and a carbonyl group. The resulting compound would be a **haloacetophenone**. The total formula is C8H7XO.\n        2.  A **(formylmethyl) group** (-CH2CHO). This also has two carbons and a carbonyl (aldehyde) group. The resulting compound would be a **halophenylacetaldehyde**. The total formula is C8H7XO.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR data options to determine the substitution pattern and identify the correct structure.**\n    *   The splitting patterns in the aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm) give clues about the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para). A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons (2H), is highly characteristic of a **para (1,4) substitution**. This symmetrical arrangement results in two distinct sets of equivalent protons on the ring. Both options A and D show this `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern, suggesting a para-substituted compound. Options B and C can be eliminated as they do not show appropriate signals for a di-substituted benzene ring.\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the remaining options (A and D) against the proposed structures.**\n\n    *   **Analyze Option D: 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: As identified, this fits a para-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   `δ 2.3 (3H, s)`: This signal is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) attached to a carbonyl, i.e., an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**. The chemical shift (around 2.1-2.5 ppm) is typical for this group. It is a singlet (s) because the adjacent carbonyl carbon has no protons, so there is no splitting.\n        *   **Conclusion for D**: This spectrum perfectly matches the structure of a **p-haloacetophenone** (e.g., 4-bromoacetophenone). This structure satisfies all the initial conditions: C8 total atoms, di-substituted aromatic, carbonyl group, and an Ar-X bond. The number of protons (2+2+3 = 7H) also matches the structure C6H4(COCH3)X. This is a very strong candidate.\n\n    *   **Analyze Option A: 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   `δ 9.9 (1H, s)`: A signal in the 9-10 ppm range is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**.\n        *   `δ 3.7 (2H, s)`: A signal around 3.7 ppm could correspond to a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aromatic ring and the carbonyl group.\n        *   **Conclusion for A**: This spectrum would correspond to a **p-halophenylacetaldehyde** structure (X-C6H4-CH2CHO). This structure also has C8, is di-substituted, has a carbonyl, and an Ar-X bond.\n        *   **Identifying the Flaw**: In a -CH2CHO group, the aldehyde proton is adjacent to the two methylene protons, and vice-versa. Due to spin-spin coupling, the aldehyde signal (-CHO) should be split by the -CH2- group into a **triplet (t)**, and the methylene signal (-CH2-) should be split by the -CHO proton into a **doublet (d)**. Option A incorrectly lists both of these signals as **singlets (s)**. This is chemically inconsistent.\n\n*   **Step 5: Final Decision**\n    *   Option D describes a chemically valid and consistent 1H NMR spectrum for p-haloacetophenone, a molecule that fits all the criteria given in the problem.\n    *   Option A describes a 1H NMR spectrum with incorrect splitting patterns for the proposed structure of p-halophenylacetaldehyde, making it an invalid representation.\n\nTherefore, the correct 1H NMR data is given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** A 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring), which accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. This means the two substituents on the benzene ring must contain a combined total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Substituents:** The ring is di-substituted.\n*   **FTIR Clues:**\n    *   A **carbonyl group (C=O)** is present.\n    *   An **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)** is present. This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I).\n\n**2. Deduce the Structure of the Substituents:**\n\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible structures for this C2-carbonyl substituent:\n    *   **Acetyl group:** -C(=O)CH₃. This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl.\n    *   **Formylmethyl group:** -CH₂CHO. This also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl.\n    *   Other possibilities like -CH₂COOH or -COOCH₃ exist, but they introduce a second oxygen atom which isn't specified (though not explicitly ruled out).\n\n**3. Determine Plausible Molecular Structures:**\n\nBased on the above, two main structural isomers are highly plausible:\n\n*   **Structure I (Ketone):** A halogen and an acetyl group on the benzene ring. The formula would be X-C₆H₄-C(=O)CH₃. This is a halo-acetophenone.\n*   **Structure II (Aldehyde):** A halogen and a formylmethyl group on the benzene ring. The formula would be X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO. This is a halo-phenylacetaldehyde.\n\nBoth structures have 8 carbons, a di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n**4. Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n\nLet's predict the NMR spectra for our plausible structures and compare them to the given options. We will pay close attention to the number of signals, their chemical shifts (δ), their integration (number of protons), and their splitting pattern (s, d, t, etc.).\n\nA key feature in options B and D is the pattern **δ 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d)**. This is a classic textbook pattern for a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring where the two substituents are electronically different. This simplifies our structural possibilities to 1-halo-4-acetylbenzene (Structure I, para) or 1-halo-4-(formylmethyl)benzene (Structure II, para).\n\n*   **Option A) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect. It only shows one aromatic proton, whereas a di-substituted benzene ring must have four.\n\n*   **Option C) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect. It shows no signals in the aromatic region (typically δ 6.5-8.5 ppm), which is impossible for a compound containing an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Option D) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d). This matches a para-disubstituted ring. The downfield shifts (7.6-7.8 ppm) indicate the ring is attached to electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** δ 2.3 (3H, s). This is a singlet for 3 protons, which is characteristic of a methyl (-CH₃) group that has no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Matching Structure:** This spectrum perfectly matches **Structure I (the ketone, 1-halo-4-acetylbenzene)**.\n        *   The two doublets are the four aromatic protons.\n        *   The singlet at ~2.3 ppm is the methyl of the acetyl group (-C(=O)**CH₃**). It's a singlet because the adjacent carbonyl carbon has no protons.\n        *   The chemical shift of ~2.3 ppm is typical for a methyl ketone. The downfield aromatic signals are also consistent with the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the acetyl group being directly attached to the ring.\n\n*   **Option B) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d). Also suggests a para-disubstituted ring.\n    *   **Low-field region:** δ 9.9 (1H, s). A signal at this chemical shift is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** δ 3.7 (2H, s). This is a singlet for 2 protons, likely a methylene (-CH₂-) group with no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Matching Structure:** This spectrum seems to describe **Structure II (the aldehyde, 1-halo-4-(formylmethyl)benzene)**.\n    *   **Inconsistency Check:** Let's look closer. In Structure II (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO), the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group is insulated from the ring by a CH₂ group. Its effect on the aromatic protons would be weaker than the direct attachment in the ketone. Therefore, the aromatic protons should be more shielded (at a lower ppm value) than in the ketone. Chemical shifts of 7.8 and 7.6 ppm are too far downfield (too deshielded) for this structure; values closer to 7.1-7.4 ppm would be expected. The spectrum in option D is far more consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe NMR data in Option D is highly consistent with the structure of a 4'-haloacetophenone (Structure I). The aromatic signals reflect a para-substituted ring with a strong electron-withdrawing group attached, and the 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm perfectly represents the methyl of the acetyl group. The data in Option B contains a significant inconsistency in the chemical shifts of the aromatic protons.\n\nTherefore, Option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\n*   **Step 1: Decode the information from the question.**\n    1.  **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached.\n    2.  **Molecular Formula:** A total of 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n    3.  **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n        *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n        *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the molecular structure.**\n    *   We have a benzene ring (C6).\n    *   One substituent is a halogen, -X (which has 0 carbons).\n    *   The other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The only common and stable arrangement for a C2 group with a carbonyl is an acetyl group: -C(=O)CH3.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The general formula is X-C6H4-COCH3.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 4 on the ring and 3 on the methyl group, for a total of 7 hydrogens. The 1H NMR spectrum should show a total integration of 7H.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum based on possible isomers (ortho, meta, para).**\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum will have signals for the aromatic protons (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) and the methyl protons of the acetyl group.\n    *   **Acetyl Group (-COCH3):** This group will always show up as a **singlet** (as there are no adjacent protons) with an integration of **3H**. The carbonyl group is deshielding, so the chemical shift will be around 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons on the ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern:\n        *   *ortho (1,2-substituted):* Would result in four distinct and complex signals (multiplets) in the aromatic region, each integrating to 1H.\n        *   *meta (1,3-substituted):* Would also result in four complex signals, though sometimes one might appear as a singlet if it's flanked by the two substituents. It's generally a complex pattern of four 1H signals.\n        *   *para (1,4-substituted):* Due to symmetry, there are only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons. This leads to a characteristic, simplified pattern: two **doublets**, each integrating to **2H**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the given NMR data options.**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The integrations (1H, 2H, 2H, 2H) sum to 7H, which is correct. However, it lacks a 3H singlet for the acetyl methyl group. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Integration:** 2H + 2H + 3H = 7H. Correct.\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). This pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, is the classic signature of a **para-substituted** benzene ring.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** 2.3 (3H, s). This is a singlet integrating to 3H, at a chemical shift perfect for the methyl group of an acetyl ketone (-COCH3).\n        *   This spectrum perfectly matches the expected data for **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. This would correspond to a structure like halo-phenylacetaldehyde. While this structure also has 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and an Ar-X bond, the protons of the -CH2-CHO group would couple with each other, resulting in a doublet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CHO, not two singlets. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum completely lacks signals in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), which is impossible for a compound containing a benzene ring. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B is the only one that correctly describes the 1H NMR spectrum of a di-substituted 8-carbon aromatic compound containing a carbonyl and an Ar-X bond, which is identified as a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information about the compound:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it is a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents.\n    *   **Molecular Formula Hint:** It contains 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must collectively contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n        *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n        *   An aromatic-halogen bond is present. This is most reliably interpreted as a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly bonded to one of the carbons of the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Propose a molecular structure:**\n    *   Let the benzene ring be represented as C6H4 (since it's di-substituted).\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   Possible C2 groups containing a carbonyl are:\n        *   `-COCH3` (acetyl group). This would form a halo-acetophenone.\n        *   `-CH2CHO` (formylmethyl group). This would form a halo-phenylacetaldehyde.\n        *   `-CH2COOH` (carboxymethyl group). This would form a halo-phenylacetic acid.\n        *   `-COOCH3` (methyl ester group). This would form a methyl halo-benzoate.\n\n3.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectra for the most likely structures and compare with the given options.** The options B and D both show a pattern of two doublets (2H each) in the 7-8 ppm region. This is a classic signature for a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring, where the symmetry results in two sets of equivalent protons. We will therefore focus on para-substituted isomers.\n\n    *   **Candidate 1: para-haloacetophenone** (Structure: X-C6H4-COCH3)\n        *   **Total Protons:** The formula is C8H7XO. There should be 4 aromatic protons + 3 methyl protons = 7 protons.\n        *   **Expected 1H NMR:**\n            *   Two doublets in the aromatic region (e.g., ~7.4-8.0 ppm) for the 4 aromatic protons.\n            *   A singlet for the methyl group (-CH3). Since this methyl group is attached to a carbonyl, it is deshielded and should appear around **2.5-2.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Comparison with Option D:** `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`.\n            *   This option matches the pattern (two doublets, one singlet) and the proton count (4+3=7).\n            *   However, the chemical shift of the singlet (2.3 ppm) is too low for an acetyl group's methyl protons (~2.6 ppm). This shift is more typical for a methyl group directly attached to the aromatic ring (a tolyl group). This makes Option D a poor match for this structure.\n\n    *   **Candidate 2: para-halophenylacetaldehyde** (Structure: X-C6H4-CH2CHO)\n        *   **Total Protons:** The formula is C8H7XO. There should be 4 aromatic protons + 2 methylene protons + 1 aldehyde proton = 7 protons.\n        *   **Expected 1H NMR:**\n            *   A signal for the aldehyde proton (-CHO). This is highly deshielded and should appear as a singlet or a triplet around **9-10 ppm**.\n            *   Two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons (~7.2-7.8 ppm).\n            *   A signal for the methylene protons (-CH2-). This group is adjacent to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl, so it should appear around **3.6-3.8 ppm**. It would typically be a doublet due to coupling with the aldehyde proton.\n        *   **Comparison with Option B:** `9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`.\n            *   **Proton Count:** 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7 protons. This is incorrect, the sum is 7 protons. Let's recheck the option in the prompt. B) `9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`. Ah, I see the integration error in my initial calculation, it should be 1+2+2+2 = 7H. Wait, let me recount the structure's protons: Ar(4H), CH2(2H), CHO(1H), total = 7H. The option integrations are 1H + 2H + 2H + 2H = 7H. OK, the proton count matches. Let's re-read the option. B) `1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`. Wait, it's a `2H` singlet, that's incorrect for a CH2. It must be `3.7 (2H, s)`. Let me assume it is a typo in my reasoning, not the option. I will re-examine the option itself: B) `1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`. Okay, a `2H singlet`. This makes sense for a `-CH2-` group with no adjacent protons.\n            *   The aldehyde proton signal at `9.9 ppm` is a perfect match.\n            *   The methylene proton signal at `3.7 ppm` is a perfect match.\n            *   The para-substituted aromatic pattern (two doublets) is present.\n            *   The structure `p-halophenylacetaldehyde` fits all the initial requirements (8C, di-substituted, C=O, Ar-X bond) and the chemical shifts in Option B are highly characteristic of it.\n            *   The only slight discrepancy is the multiplicity. We would expect coupling between the -CH2- and -CHO protons (a doublet and a triplet). However, it is common for this coupling to be absent or very small, resulting in two singlets, especially in idealized problems or under certain experimental conditions (e.g., exchange with trace acid/water).\n\n4.  **Evaluate other options:**\n    *   **A) & C):** These options lack signals in the typical aromatic region (7-8 ppm), which is inconsistent with having an aromatic ring. Therefore, they are incorrect.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Option D is a poor fit because the key methyl chemical shift is significantly different from the expected value for the only plausible structure.\n    *   Option B provides data where the chemical shifts of the characteristic aldehyde and methylene protons are an excellent match for the `para-halophenylacetaldehyde` structure. This structure, in turn, perfectly fits all the conditions described in the problem. The discrepancy in multiplicity is a plausible simplification.\n\nTherefore, Option B represents the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Compound Information:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituent groups attached (C₆H₄R₁R₂). A benzene ring itself contains 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: A carbonyl group is a C=O double bond. This must be part of one of the substituents.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, I) is directly attached to the benzene ring. So, one substituent is a halogen atom, let's denote it as -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   A group with 2 carbons and a C=O group is an acetyl group: -C(=O)CH₃.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Full Molecular Structure:**\n    *   The compound consists of a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom and one acetyl group. The general structure is haloacetophenone.\n    *   Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, there are three possible isomers:\n        *   **Ortho (1,2-substitution)**\n        *   **Meta (1,3-substitution)**\n        *   **Para (1,4-substitution)**\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Isomer:**\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum will show signals for the aromatic protons (on the ring) and the methyl protons (-CH₃) of the acetyl group.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The methyl group is attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, these 3 protons will appear as a **singlet (s)**, typically in the range of 2.0-2.6 ppm. This will be common to all three isomers.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C₆H₄):** This is the key to distinguishing the isomers.\n        *   **Para isomer (1,4-disubstituted):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. The 4 aromatic protons are in two sets of two equivalent protons. This results in a very characteristic pattern: **two doublets (d), each integrating to 2H**. One doublet will be for the protons next to the acetyl group, and the other for the protons next to the halogen. These signals typically appear between 7.0 and 8.0 ppm.\n        *   **Ortho (1,2) and Meta (1,3) isomers:** These molecules lack symmetry. All four aromatic protons are chemically non-equivalent. This results in a much more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, typically with four separate signals (e.g., multiplets, doublets of doublets, triplets of doublets), not two simple doublets of 2H intensity.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options against the Predictions:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic region:** `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)` - This is two doublets, each for two protons. This perfectly matches the pattern predicted for the **para isomer**. The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, so the protons adjacent to it are shifted furthest downfield (7.8 ppm).\n        *   **Aliphatic region:** `2.3 (3H, s)` - This is a singlet for three protons, matching the methyl of an acetyl group.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This spectrum is a perfect match for a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are not in the typical aromatic region (7-8 ppm). This spectrum does not correspond to the described compound.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   A signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a ketone (-COCH₃). This contradicts the structure we deduced.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   Similar to option B, this lacks the signals in the aromatic proton region (7-8 ppm). It is not the correct spectrum.\n\nBased on the analysis, only option A describes the 1H NMR spectrum that would be produced by the compound described in the question, which is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula core:** The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms. It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which accounts for 6 carbon atoms (C6). Therefore, the two substituents attached to the ring must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n        *   A **carbonyl group (C=O)** is present.\n        *   An **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)** is present. This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Propose a Structure:**\n    *   Based on the information above, one substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable chemical group fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The general formula is C8H7XO.\n    *   The problem states it's a di-substituted ring. The two substituents (-X and -COCH3) can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions. The 1H NMR spectrum will reveal this arrangement due to molecular symmetry.\n\n3.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the Proposed Structure (Haloacetophenone):**\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The acetyl group (-COCH3) has three protons on its methyl group. These protons are adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, they will not be split and will appear as a **singlet (s)**. Their chemical shift is typically in the range of δ 2.2-2.6 ppm due to the deshielding effect of the carbonyl group. This signal should integrate to **3H**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are 4 protons on the di-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   If the substitution is **ortho or meta**, the four aromatic protons are all chemically non-equivalent, which would lead to a complex spectrum with four distinct signals.\n        *   If the substitution is **para (1,4)**, the molecule has a high degree of symmetry. The two protons ortho to the acetyl group are equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen are also equivalent to each other. This results in a simple pattern: two signals, each integrating to **2H**. Each signal appears as a **doublet (d)** because each proton is split by its single adjacent proton neighbor. This characteristic `(2H, d)` and `(2H, d)` pattern in the δ 7-8 ppm range is a classic signature of para-substitution.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum does not show a 3H singlet for an acetyl group. It also only shows 1H in the aromatic region, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted ring. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum has no signals in the typical aromatic region (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm). An aromatic compound must show peaks in this region. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic region:** `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This is the classic, clean pattern for a **para-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n        *   **Alkyl region:** `2.3 (3H, s)`. This perfectly matches the signal for an **acetyl group's methyl protons** (a 3H singlet around 2.3 ppm).\n        *   This spectrum is an exact match for the predicted spectrum of **para-haloacetophenone**. It satisfies all conditions: C8, di-substituted aromatic, carbonyl group, aromatic-halogen bond (inferred from the structure that fits the NMR), and the correct NMR signals.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at **δ 9.9 ppm** is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**.\n        *   This means the carbonyl group is an aldehyde.\n        *   The aromatic pattern (`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`) suggests para-substitution.\n        *   A plausible structure with C8, a para-substituted ring, an aldehyde, and a halogen would be **4-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde (Ar-CH2-X)**. This structure has 8 carbons, and its NMR would indeed show two aromatic doublets, a singlet for the aldehyde proton, and a singlet for the CH2 protons.\n        *   **However, this structure contradicts the FTIR data.** In 4-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde, the halogen is on a benzylic carbon (C-X), not directly on the aromatic ring (Ar-X). The question explicitly states an \"aromatic-halogen bond\". Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Option C is the only one that is fully consistent with all the provided information. The compound is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Compound's Description:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This means we have a benzene ring (C6) with two groups attached to it. The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** Since the ring is 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR: carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl functional group.\n    *   **FTIR: aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** The other substituent is a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, or I) directly bonded to the benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure:**\n    *   We have two substituents to place on the benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This doesn't account for any of the remaining 2 carbons.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the 2 remaining carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable group that fits this description is the acetyl group: **-C(=O)CH₃**.\n    *   So, the compound is a **halogenoacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO. This structure has 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond, fulfilling all the conditions.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Isomers and their Expected 1H NMR Spectra:**\n    *   The two substituents (halogen and acetyl group) can be arranged in three ways on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n    *   **Common feature:** Regardless of the substitution pattern, the methyl group (-CH₃) of the acetyl substituent is isolated from other protons, so it will always appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its chemical shift should be around 2.0-2.6 ppm because it's adjacent to a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** The pattern of the 4 aromatic protons depends on the substitution.\n        *   **Ortho or Meta:** These isomers would give a complex set of signals (e.g., multiplets, doublets of doublets) for the 4 aromatic protons because they are all in different chemical environments.\n        *   **Para:** This isomer is symmetrical. The 4 aromatic protons are present as two pairs of equivalent protons. This symmetry results in a much simpler spectrum, typically seen as **two distinct doublets (d)**, with each doublet integrating to **2H**. This is a very characteristic pattern for 1,4-disubstitution.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** It shows two doublets, each for 2 protons. This `(2H, d)` and `(2H, d)` pattern is the hallmark of a **para-substituted** aromatic ring. The chemical shifts (7.6-7.8 ppm) are appropriate for an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** It shows a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches the methyl protons of an acetyl group `(-COCH₃)`.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This data perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for a para-halogenoacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum does not show the correct pattern for aromatic protons (expecting 4H total in the 6.5-8.5 ppm range). The signals are inconsistent with the described structure.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The `9.9 (1H, s)` peak is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a ketone. If the compound were an aldehyde (e.g., p-halomethylbenzaldehyde), the halogen would be on a methyl group (-CH₂X), not directly on the aromatic ring. This contradicts the \"aromatic-halogen bond\" information from the FTIR.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This option has no peaks in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). This is incorrect as the compound is described as aromatic.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Option A is the only choice that is fully consistent with all the information provided. The structure is a para-substituted halogenoacetophenone, which has 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, an aromatic-halogen bond, and produces a 1H NMR spectrum with two doublets in the aromatic region and a 3H singlet for the methyl ketone.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound and its 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula Core:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring, C6H4) and a total of 8 carbon atoms. This means the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n        *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n        *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present.\n    *   **Putting it together:** The compound is a halobenzene with a second substituent that contains two carbons and a carbonyl group. The halogen atom (-X, e.g., -Cl, -Br) is one substituent. The other substituent must have the formula C2HnO.\n\n2.  **Identify Possible Structures for the Second Substituent:**\n    The second substituent has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The most common and stable chemical groups that fit this description are:\n    *   **Acetyl group:** -C(=O)CH3. This fits the criteria perfectly.\n    *   **Formylmethyl group:** -CH2CHO. This also fits the criteria.\n    *   **Methoxycarbonyl (ester):** -COOCH3. This also fits.\n    *   **Carboxymethyl group:** -CH2COOH. This fits, but the acidic proton has a very characteristic broad signal, usually >10 ppm.\n\n3.  **Combine the Substituents and Ring to Form Possible Isomers:**\n    Let's focus on the most likely candidate from a chemical stability and commonality standpoint, the acetyl group.\n    *   **Structure based on Acetyl Group:** The compound would be a **haloacetophenone**. With one halogen and one acetyl group, the total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. This matches the description. The general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3.\n    *   The substitution can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n\n4.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Options in the Context of a Haloacetophenone Structure:**\n    A haloacetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3) has:\n    *   4 aromatic protons on the benzene ring.\n    *   3 protons from the methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   Total protons = 7.\n\n    Now, let's examine the patterns expected from the isomers and compare them with the given options.\n    *   **Para-substitution (1,4-isomer):** This typically gives a very distinct pattern in the aromatic region: two doublets, each integrating to 2H. The methyl group (-CH3) is attached to a carbonyl, so it has no adjacent protons and will appear as a singlet integrating to 3H.\n    *   **Ortho/Meta-substitution:** These would give more complex patterns for the 4 aromatic protons, not two clean doublets.\n\n    Let's look at the options provided:\n    *   A) `6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)`: The proton count and splitting patterns are inconsistent with any simple haloacetophenone isomer. Incorrect.\n    *   B) `4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)`: This spectrum has no signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). This is impossible for a compound with an aromatic ring. Incorrect.\n    *   C) `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`:\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)` is the classic pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring with two different substituents. It integrates to 4H.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** `2.3 (3H, s)` is a singlet integrating to 3 protons, which perfectly matches the methyl group of an acetyl (-COCH3) substituent.\n        *   **Overall:** This spectrum is an excellent match for a **p-haloacetophenone**. The acetyl group (-COCH3) and the halogen (-X) are both electron-withdrawing groups, which deshield the aromatic protons, pushing their chemical shifts downfield to the observed 7.6-7.8 ppm range. This option is a very strong candidate.\n\n    *   D) `9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`:\n        *   This spectrum suggests a different structure. The `9.9 (1H, s)` peak is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The `3.7 (2H, s)` peak suggests a methylene (-CH2-) group next to an electron-withdrawing group but with no adjacent protons. This matches the formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO). The aromatic pattern is again for para-substitution. So this would be **p-halo-(phenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n        *   **Consistency Check:** The problem with this option is the chemical shift of the aromatic protons. A -CH2CHO group is only weakly electron-withdrawing because the C=O group is not directly conjugated with the ring. Therefore, the aromatic protons would be expected at a much higher field (further upfield, lower ppm), typically around 7.2-7.4 ppm. The value of 7.6-7.8 ppm is too far downfield and inconsistent with this structure.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The NMR data in option C is the only one that is fully consistent with a structure that meets all the criteria given in the problem. The compound is a p-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **Structure:** p-haloacetophenone (e.g., 4'-Bromoacetophenone).\n    *   **Carbons:** 8 carbons (6 ring + 2 acetyl). Correct.\n    *   **FTIR:** Contains C=O and Ar-X. Correct.\n    *   **1H NMR:** A para-substituted aromatic pattern (two doublets, 4H total) and a methyl singlet (3H). The chemical shifts in the aromatic region (7.6-7.8 ppm) are consistent with the strong deshielding effect of a conjugated carbonyl group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: The core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR ... carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **\"FTIR ... aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring. A halogen atom contains zero carbon atoms.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   We have established one substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must account for the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   There are two primary possibilities for a two-carbon, carbonyl-containing group:\n        1.  An acetyl group: -COCH3\n        2.  A formylmethyl group: -CH2CHO\n\n3.  **Propose Possible Molecular Structures:**\n    *   Based on the above, the compound could be a haloacetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3) or a halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n    *   The problem does not specify the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n\n4.  **Analyze Predicted 1H NMR Spectra for Each Structure:**\n\n    *   **Case 1: Haloacetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3)**\n        *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4)**: There are 4 protons on the ring. Their pattern will depend on the substitution (ortho, meta, para). A para (1,4) substitution is common and gives a highly symmetric pattern: two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, typically in the 7-8 ppm range.\n        *   **Methyl Protons (-COCH3)**: There are 3 protons. Since they are attached to a carbonyl carbon (which has no protons), they will appear as a sharp **singlet**. The chemical shift for a methyl ketone is typically around **2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO)**\n        *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4)**: Similar to the first case, 4 protons on the ring.\n        *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO)**: There is 1 proton. Aldehyde protons are highly deshielded and appear far downfield, typically between **9-10 ppm**. This proton is adjacent to the -CH2- group, so it should be split into a **triplet**.\n        *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-)**: There are 2 protons. They are adjacent to the aldehyde proton, so they should be split into a **doublet**. Their chemical shift would be around **3.5-4.5 ppm**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given NMR Options against the Predictions:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   This option has an aldehyde-like proton at 9.9 ppm and methylene-like protons at 3.7 ppm. This matches the chemical shifts for the halophenylacetaldehyde structure.\n        *   However, the splitting is incorrect. The aldehyde proton is listed as a singlet (`s`), not a triplet (`t`), and the methylene protons are listed as a singlet (`s`), not a doublet (`d`). This indicates a lack of coupling, which is very unlikely. The pattern in the aromatic region (two doublets) suggests para-substitution.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This data does not show signals in the typical aromatic (7-8 ppm), aldehyde (9-10 ppm), or ketone (2.1-2.6 ppm) regions.

The structure is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Compound's Molecular Formula and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Total Carbons:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Core Structure:** It has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C6).\n    *   **Substituents:** Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the substituents must contain the remaining 2 carbons (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **FTIR Information:**\n        *   A **carbonyl group (C=O)** is present.\n        *   An **aromatic-halogen bond** is present. This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring with two substituents.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The most common and stable functional group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**.\n\n3.  **Consider Isomerism and its effect on 1H NMR:**\n    *   The two substituents (halogen and acetyl group) can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: *ortho* (1,2-), *meta* (1,3-), or *para* (1,4-).\n    *   The symmetry of the isomer determines the appearance of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n        *   ***ortho* and *meta* isomers:** These are unsymmetrical. They would have 4 distinct protons on the aromatic ring, leading to a complex spectrum with four different signals (though some might overlap).\n        *   ***para* isomer:** This isomer has a plane of symmetry passing through the two substituents. This symmetry makes the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 equivalent. This results in a much simpler spectrum.\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the *para* Isomer (e.g., 4-chloroacetophenone):**\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):**\n        *   There are 3 equivalent protons in the methyl group.\n        *   They are adjacent to a carbonyl group, which deshields them. Their chemical shift should be in the range of **2.0-2.5 ppm**.\n        *   They are not adjacent to any other protons, so their signal will be a **singlet (s)**.\n        *   The integration will be **3H**.\n        *   Predicted signal: **~2.3 ppm (3H, s)**.\n\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:**\n        *   The aromatic region (usually 6.5-8.5 ppm) will contain signals for the 4 protons on the ring.\n        *   Due to the *para* symmetry, there are two sets of equivalent protons.\n        *   **Protons ortho to the acetyl group:** These are the two protons closer to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group. They will be the most deshielded (highest chemical shift). They are a set of 2 equivalent protons, and each is split by its single neighbor, resulting in a **doublet (d)**. Integration: **2H**. Predicted signal: **~7.8-8.0 ppm (2H, d)**.\n        *   **Protons ortho to the halogen group:** These are the other two protons. They are also deshielded but generally less so than the ones next to the acetyl group. They are also a set of 2 equivalent protons, each split by its single neighbor, resulting in a **doublet (d)**. Integration: **2H**. Predicted signal: **~7.5-7.7 ppm (2H, d)**.\n\n5.  **Compare the Prediction with the Given Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: Perfectly matches the prediction for the acetyl methyl group.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: Perfectly matches the prediction for the two sets of protons on a *para*-substituted benzene ring. This is the correct answer.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   Incorrect. The chemical shifts `4.8` and `4.6` are not in the aromatic proton region (7-8 ppm). `1.3 ppm` is too upfield for a methyl group next to a carbonyl.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   Incorrect. A signal at `9.9 ppm` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not the ketone (acetophenone) structure we deduced.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   Incorrect. This data does not fit the structure for multiple reasons, including wrong chemical shifts for aromatic protons and incorrect integration values.\n\nConclusion: The data in option A perfectly describes a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Molecular Formula and Features from the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C₆) with two substituents attached. A di-substituted benzene ring has the formula C₆H₄.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum...indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum...indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\n**2. Assembling the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   We have a benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group (C=O). Let's deduce the structure of this C₂-carbonyl substituent.\n    *   **Possibility 1: Acetyl group, -C(=O)CH₃.** This group has two carbons and a carbonyl. The resulting molecule is a haloacetophenone: X-C₆H₄-C(=O)CH₃. The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 1 (carbonyl C) + 1 (methyl C) = 8. This fits all the criteria.\n    *   **Possibility 2: A -CH₂CHO group.** This group also has two carbons and a carbonyl. The resulting molecule is a (halophenyl)acetaldehyde: X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO. The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 1 (CH₂ C) + 1 (CHO C) = 8. This also fits all the criteria.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Provided 1H NMR Options**\n\nNow, we need to determine which of the possible structures matches one of the given NMR spectra. A key feature to look for in the spectra is the pattern in the aromatic region. For a para-disubstituted ring (which is highly symmetrical), we expect to see a distinct pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H. For ortho or meta substitution, the pattern would be more complex.\n\n*   **Option B and D:** These can be immediately eliminated because they do not show signals in the typical aromatic region (usually 6.5-8.5 ppm) that would account for the 4 protons on a di-substituted benzene ring.\n*   **Option A: 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum corresponds to the (halophenyl)acetaldehyde structure (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n    *   `δ 9.9 (1H, s)`: A sharp singlet very far downfield is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n    *   `δ 3.7 (2H, s)`: A signal in this region for 2 protons fits a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group (a benzylic, α-carbonyl position). The singlet multiplicity means it is not observably coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n    *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern indicates a para (1,4) substitution on the benzene ring.\n*   **Option C: 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum corresponds to the haloacetophenone structure (X-C₆H₄-C(=O)CH₃).\n    *   `δ 2.3 (3H, s)`: A singlet for 3 protons around 2.1-2.6 ppm is the classic signature of a methyl ketone (-COCH₃).\n    *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern again indicates para (1,4) substitution.\n\n**4. Differentiating Between Option A and C using Chemical Shift Theory**\n\nBoth options A and C seem plausible as they describe molecules that fit the initial criteria and exhibit para-substitution patterns. The decision must be made by looking closer at the chemical shifts. The aromatic chemical shifts in both options are identical (7.8 and 7.6 ppm). We need to determine for which structure these shifts are more realistic.\n\n*   The electronic effect of the substituent determines the chemical shift of the aromatic protons. Both -COCH₃ and -CH₂CHO are electron-withdrawing groups, which deshield the ring protons and shift them downfield.\n*   However, the acetyl group (-COCH₃) is a much stronger electron-withdrawing group than the -CH₂CHO group because its carbonyl is directly conjugated with the aromatic ring (a powerful -R resonance effect).\n*   The -CH₂CHO group's carbonyl is insulated from the ring by a CH₂ group, so it can only exert a weaker, inductive (-I) effect.\n*   Therefore, the aromatic protons of **p-haloacetophenone** (structure for C) should be significantly more downfield (higher ppm) than those of **p-(halophenyl)acetaldehyde** (structure for A).\n\nLet's verify this by checking typical literature values.\n*   **For p-haloacetophenone** (e.g., p-bromoacetophenone), the aromatic signals are indeed found around **7.6-7.9 ppm**. This matches the data in option C.\n*   **For p-(halophenyl)acetaldehyde** (e.g., p-bromophenylacetaldehyde), the aromatic signals are found at much higher fields (lower ppm), typically around **7.1-7.5 ppm**.\n\nThe aromatic shifts given in Option A (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) are inconsistent with the (halophenyl)acetaldehyde structure it represents. These shifts are far too downfield. In contrast, the data in Option C is entirely consistent with a p-haloacetophenone structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is a p-haloacetophenone. Its 1H NMR spectrum would show two doublets in the aromatic region for the 4 aromatic protons and a singlet for the 3 methyl protons. Option C accurately describes this.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**Step 1: Deduce the molecular structure from the given information.**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents attached.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum...indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O)\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **\"as well as an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)\"**: One substituent is a halogen (e.g., F, Cl, Br, I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n\nCombining these facts, we can determine the two substituents:\n1.  A halogen atom (-X).\n2.  A second substituent that contains both the carbonyl group and all 2 remaining carbon atoms. The most common and simple structure for a two-carbon substituent with a carbonyl group is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\nTherefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the possible substitution patterns and their expected 1H NMR spectra.**\n\nA haloacetophenone has 4 protons on the aromatic ring and 3 protons on the methyl group of the acetyl substituent. The total number of protons is 7.\n\nThe substitution pattern can be ortho, meta, or para. Let's consider how the aromatic protons would appear in the 1H NMR spectrum for each isomer:\n*   **Ortho-isomer (1,2-disubstituted)**: The four aromatic protons are all in different chemical environments. This would lead to a complex pattern with four distinct signals (multiplets), not simple doublets.\n*   **Meta-isomer (1,3-disubstituted)**: This would also result in a complex pattern for the four aromatic protons. We would not expect to see two simple doublets.\n*   **Para-isomer (1,4-disubstituted)**: This isomer has a plane of symmetry passing through the two substituents.\n    *   The two protons next to (ortho to) the acetyl group are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The two protons next to (ortho to) the halogen are also chemically equivalent.\n    *   These two sets of protons couple with each other, resulting in a characteristic pattern of **two doublets**, each integrating to **2H**.\n    *   The acetyl group's methyl protons (-CH₃) have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **singlet**, integrating to **3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl ketone is typically around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the predicted spectrum with the given options.**\n\n*   **Predicted spectrum for p-haloacetophenone**:\n    *   ~7.5-8.0 ppm: Aromatic region showing two doublets, each for 2H.\n    *   ~2.1-2.6 ppm: A singlet for 3H.\n    *   Total protons: 2H + 2H + 3H = 7H.\n\n*   **Analyzing the options:**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This option shows two doublets (d) in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. This is the classic signature of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   It also shows a singlet (s) integrating to 3H at 2.3 ppm, which is perfect for an acetyl methyl group.\n        *   This data is an excellent match for p-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. The structure would have to be p-halophenylacetaldehyde. However, for that structure, the methylene protons (-CH₂-) at ~3.7 ppm would be a doublet (split by the aldehyde proton), and the aldehyde proton would be a triplet (split by the methylene protons). The option incorrectly lists both as singlets.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts ~4.6-4.8 ppm are too low for protons on an aromatic ring. This does not fit the described compound.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The integration and splitting patterns for the aromatic protons (should be 4H total, not 1H) are incorrect. The chemical shifts are also not characteristic of the proposed structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the only option that correctly represents the 1H NMR spectrum of a di-substituted aromatic compound with 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and a halogen (specifically, p-haloacetophenone) is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\n**1. Deconstruction of the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups**\n\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms (C8).\n*   **Core Structure:** It has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we have a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents.\n*   **FTIR Information:**\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Putting it together:**\n    *   The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X).\n    *   This leaves 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms for the second substituent.\n    *   This second substituent must also contain the carbonyl group.\n\n**2. Identifying Candidate Structures**\n\nWe need to find a 2-carbon group that contains a carbonyl. The two most common and stable possibilities are:\n*   **An acetyl group:** -COCH3. If this group is attached to the halo-benzene ring, the structure is **haloacetophenone** (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n*   **An acetic acid group attached via its methylene carbon:** -CH2COOH. If this group is attached to the halo-benzene ring, the structure is **(halophenyl)acetic acid** (X-C6H4-CH2COOH).\n\nBoth of these structures fit all the initial criteria:\n*   Di-substituted aromatic ring: Yes.\n*   8 Carbon atoms: Yes (6 in ring + 2 in substituent).\n*   Carbonyl group: Yes (ketone or carboxylic acid).\n*   Aromatic-halogen bond: Yes.\n\n**3. Analyzing the ¹H NMR Data Options**\n\nThe splitting pattern of the aromatic protons in an NMR spectrum is highly indicative of the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para). The options showing two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a **para (1,4) substitution pattern**. This symmetrical pattern gives a clean A₂B₂ (or AA'BB') spectrum, which appears as two distinct doublets. Options A and D show this pattern. Options B and C can be eliminated as they don't show the correct signals for a di-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Option B:** No signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). Incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** Shows only one aromatic proton. A di-substituted ring must have four aromatic protons. Incorrect.\n\nNow we must choose between Option A and Option D, which both suggest a para-substituted ring. We will match them to our candidate structures.\n\n**4. Evaluating Option A vs. Candidate Structures**\n\n*   **Option A:** ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)\n*   The signals at **7.8 ppm (2H, d)** and **7.6 ppm (2H, d)** confirm the para-substituted aromatic ring.\n*   The signal at **3.7 ppm (2H, s)** corresponds to a -CH₂- group with no adjacent protons. This matches the -CH₂- group in (4-halophenyl)acetic acid, `X-C₆H₄-CH₂COOH`.\n*   The signal at **9.9 ppm (1H, s)** would then have to be the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). While carboxylic acid protons are singlets, their chemical shift is typically in the 10-13 ppm range. A value of 9.9 ppm is unusually low. Also, chemical shifts of 7.6-7.8 ppm are quite downfield for the aromatic protons of a phenylacetic acid derivative (which are typically around 7.2-7.4 ppm). Therefore, this data is not a good match for (4-halophenyl)acetic acid.\n*   Alternatively, 9.9 ppm is a classic chemical shift for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This would suggest the structure (4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde (`X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO`). However, in this structure, the aldehyde proton (-CHO) is adjacent to the methylene protons (-CH₂-), and they would couple with each other. The spectrum should show a triplet for the -CHO proton and a doublet for the -CH₂- protons, not two singlets.\n*   Conclusion: Option A does not accurately represent a plausible structure that fits all the criteria.\n\n**5. Evaluating Option D vs. Candidate Structures**\n\n*   **Option D:** ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)\n*   The signals at **7.8 ppm (2H, d)** and **7.6 ppm (2H, d)** again confirm a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n*   The signal at **2.3 ppm (3H, s)** is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a carbonyl group (a methyl ketone).\n*   Let's check if this data matches our candidate structure, **4-haloacetophenone** (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃).\n    *   **Structure:** Has a para-substituted ring, which would give two doublets. Matches.\n    *   **Protons:** It has 4 aromatic protons and 3 methyl protons. The integrations (2H, 2H, 3H) match this.\n    *   **Splitting:** The methyl group is not adjacent to any protons, so it should be a singlet. Matches.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** For ketones, the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group deshields the ortho protons (closer to the group), shifting them downfield. The aromatic signals at 7.6 and 7.8 ppm are very reasonable. A methyl ketone singlet typically appears around 2.1-2.6 ppm, so 2.3 ppm is a perfect fit.\n*   Conclusion: The NMR data in Option D is an excellent match for a 4-haloacetophenone (e.g., 4-bromoacetophenone or 4-iodoacetophenone), which fulfills all the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\nFinal comparison confirms that Option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\":** This indicates a benzene ring with two groups attached. The general formula is C₆H₄XY.\n*   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\":** The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents (X and Y) must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... carbonyl group\":** This confirms the presence of a C=O double bond in one of the substituents.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... aromatic-halogen bond\":** This confirms that one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring. Let's call this substituent -X.\n\n**2. Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n\n*   We have one halogen substituent, -X.\n*   The second substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable substituent fitting this description is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   Let's check the carbon count: C₆ (ring) + C₂ (acetyl group) = C₈. This matches the total carbon count.\n*   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**.\n\n*Alternative Structure Check:* Another possibility for the C₂ + carbonyl substituent could be -CH₂CHO. This would make the molecule a halophenylacetaldehyde. We will keep this in mind as we analyze the NMR data.\n\n**3. Analyze the Substitution Pattern based on NMR Data:**\n\nLet's examine the aromatic region of the NMR spectra provided in the options.\n\n*   Options A and D both show a pattern of `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern, consisting of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para isomer makes the two protons on one side of the ring chemically equivalent to each other, and the same for the two protons on the other side. This results in the simple \"doublet of doublets\" pattern.\n*   Ortho (1,2) or meta (1,3) substitution would lead to more complex spectra with four distinct signals in the aromatic region, which is not observed in options A or D.\n*   Options B and C can be eliminated. Option B shows no aromatic protons. Option C's aromatic region (`6.9 (1H, s)`) is inconsistent with a disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nSo, the compound must be a **p-haloacetophenone** or a **p-halophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**4. Differentiate Between the Two Possible Structures using Full NMR Data:**\n\n*   **Structure 1: p-haloacetophenone** (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃)\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** Two doublets, 4H total. (Matches A & D)\n    *   **Acetyl group protons (-COCH₃):** A methyl group next to a carbonyl with no adjacent protons. This should appear as a **singlet integrating to 3H**, typically in the range of 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n*   **Structure 2: p-halophenylacetaldehyde** (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** Two doublets, 4H total. (Matches A & D)\n    *   **Aldehyde proton (-CHO):** Very deshielded, typically 9-10 ppm. It is adjacent to the -CH₂- group, so it should be a **triplet**.\n    *   **Methylene protons (-CH₂-):** Benzylic and adjacent to a carbonyl, typically 3.5-4.0 ppm. It is adjacent to the -CHO proton, so it should be a **doublet**.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Final Options (A and D):**\n\n*   **Option D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches the expectation for **p-haloacetophenone**.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: The para-substituted aromatic ring.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: The singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group. The chemical shift, integration, and splitting are all correct.\n\n*   **Option A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum attempts to describe p-halophenylacetaldehyde due to the aldehyde peak at 9.9 ppm.\n    *   However, there is a critical error in the splitting pattern. The aldehyde proton at 9.9 ppm and the methylene protons at 3.7 ppm should be a triplet and a doublet, respectively, due to mutual coupling. They are incorrectly listed as **singlets (s)**.\n    *   Furthermore, the aromatic signals at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm are more deshielded than what would be expected for a ring attached to a -CH₂CHO group; they are more consistent with the strong electron-withdrawing effect of a directly attached acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe data in Option D is a perfect match for p-haloacetophenone, which fulfills all the criteria described in the question. The data in Option A contains significant inconsistencies.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Decipher the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituent groups attached to it.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms. This means the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR ... presence of a carbonyl group (C=O)\"**: One of the substituents contains a carbonyl group.\n*   **\"FTIR ... presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, I) attached directly to the aromatic ring. Let's denote this as -X.\n\nNow let's combine these facts to build the structure:\n*   We have a halogen (-X) on the ring.\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. Possible structures for this second substituent are:\n    *   An acetyl group: -C(=O)CH₃. This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl. This fits.\n    *   A formylmethyl group: -CH₂CHO. This also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl. This also fits.\n    *   An ester like methoxycarbonyl: -COOCH₃. This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl. This also fits.\n\nSo, the potential molecules are a halo-acetophenone (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃), a halophenyl-acetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO), or a methyl halo-benzoate (X-C₆H₄-COOCH₃).\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data Options**\n\nLet's focus on the signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5 - 8.5 ppm) first.\n\n*   **Option A**: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)\n*   **Option B**: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)\n*   **Option C**: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d) - The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the aromatic region. This option is incorrect.\n*   **Option D**: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d) - There are no signals in the aromatic region. This option is incorrect.\n\nBoth options A and B show a pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons. This is the classic signature of a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring. In this arrangement, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, resulting in only two types of aromatic protons, which split each other into doublets.\n\nSo, we know our compound has the structure `para-X-C₆H₄-R`.\n\n**3. Evaluate Options A and B against the Possible Structures**\n\n*   **Structure 1: para-haloacetophenone (p-X-C₆H₄-COCH₃)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: We expect two doublets, each for 2H. This matches both A and B. Both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing, which would shift the aromatic protons downfield (to higher ppm values), consistent with the ~7.6-7.8 ppm shifts.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons**: We have a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a carbonyl. This group is isolated from other protons, so it should appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift is around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n\n*   **Structure 2: para-halophenylacetaldehyde (p-X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: We expect two doublets, each for 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons**: We have two sets of protons:\n        *   An aldehyde proton (-CHO): This is highly deshielded, appears far downfield (~9.5-10 ppm), and should be a **triplet (t)** due to splitting by the adjacent -CH₂ group. It integrates to **1H**.\n        *   A methylene group (-CH₂-): This appears around ~3.5-4.0 ppm and should be a **doublet (d)** due to splitting by the -CHO proton. It integrates to **2H**.\n\n**4. Match the NMR Data to the Best Structure**\n\nLet's re-examine options A and B:\n\n*   **Option A) `1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`**\n    *   This data seems to describe the aldehyde structure (`p-X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO`). The 9.9 ppm signal matches the aldehyde proton, and the 3.7 ppm signal matches the methylene group.\n    *   **However, there are two major problems:**\n        1.  **Multiplicity**: Both the aldehyde proton and the methylene protons are listed as singlets (`s`). They are adjacent and must split each other, so they should be a triplet and a doublet, respectively.\n        2.  **Aromatic Shift**: The aromatic shifts (7.6-7.8 ppm) are too high (too downfield) for a molecule with a -CH₂CHO group. This group is not strongly electron-withdrawing enough to cause such a large shift.\n\n*   **Option B) `1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`**\n    *   This data perfectly matches the ketone structure (`p-X-C₆H₄-COCH₃`).\n    *   The `2.3 (3H, s)` signal is exactly what we expect for the methyl protons of an acetyl group (-COCH₃): a singlet for 3 protons at ~2.3 ppm.\n    *   The `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` signals are consistent with a para-substituted ring containing a strongly electron-withdrawing acetyl group, which deshields the protons and shifts them downfield.\n    *   The integration (2H + 2H + 3H = 7 total protons) and multiplicities are all chemically correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is a para-haloacetophenone. Option B provides the 1H NMR data that is fully consistent with this structure in terms of chemical shifts, integration, and multiplicity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Structure from the Clues:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two groups attached to it (C6H4). A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The entire molecule has 8 carbons. Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of ... an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (like -F, -Cl, -Br, -I) directly attached to the benzene ring. Let's call it -X.\n\n**2. Identify the Substituents:**\n\n*   One substituent is a halogen, -X. This substituent does not contain any carbon atoms.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   A two-carbon group containing a carbonyl can be:\n    *   An **acetyl group** (-COCH3). This is a ketone.\n    *   A **formylmethyl group** (-CH2CHO). This is an aldehyde.\n\n**3. Propose Possible Molecular Structures:**\n\nBased on the above, two main structures fit all the initial criteria:\n*   **Structure I: Haloacetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3)**. Example: 4-chloroacetophenone.\n*   **Structure II: Halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO)**. Example: 4-chlorophenylacetaldehyde.\n\nBoth structures have 8 carbons, a di-substituted benzene ring, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n**4. Predict the 1H NMR Spectra for the Proposed Structures:**\n\nTo simplify the analysis, we'll assume the most symmetric isomer, the **para (1,4)-substituted** form, which typically gives a clean spectrum with two doublets in the aromatic region.\n\n*   **Prediction for Structure I (para-Haloacetophenone):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H)**: The aromatic ring is directly attached to an electron-withdrawing carbonyl group (-COCH3) and a halogen (-X). This will significantly de-shield (shift downfield) the aromatic protons. We expect signals in the range of **7.5-8.0 ppm**. For a para-isomer, this will appear as two doublets, each integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H)**: The protons of the -CH3 group next to a carbonyl typically appear as a singlet in the range of **2.0-2.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Summary:** 4H (2 doublets, ~7.5-8.0 ppm) and 3H (singlet, ~2.0-2.5 ppm).\n\n*   **Prediction for Structure II (para-Halophenylacetaldehyde):**\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (1H)**: The -CHO proton is highly characteristic and appears as a singlet (or narrow triplet) far downfield, typically in the range of **9.5-10.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (2H)**: The -CH2- protons are situated between the aromatic ring and the aldehyde group. They would appear around **3.5-4.0 ppm**. It would likely be a singlet or a small doublet (due to coupling with the aldehyde proton).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H)**: The ring is attached to a -CH2CHO group. The insulating -CH2- group means the electron-withdrawing effect of the distant carbonyl on the ring is much weaker than in Structure I. The aromatic signals would be less de-shielded, appearing closer to the range for alkylbenzenes, perhaps **7.1-7.4 ppm**. Again, we expect two doublets for a para-isomer.\n    *   **Summary:** 1H (singlet, ~9.5-10 ppm), 2H (singlet, ~3.5-4.0 ppm), 4H (2 doublets, ~7.1-7.4 ppm).\n\n**5. Evaluate the Given Options against Predictions:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**: Does not match either prediction. The integrations and splitting patterns are inconsistent with either proposed structure.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**: Incorrect. There are no signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm).\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**: This spectrum has the signals for an aldehyde (9.9 ppm) and methylene group (3.7 ppm), matching the functional groups of Structure II (Halophenylacetaldehyde). However, the aromatic signals (7.6 and 7.8 ppm) are far too downfield (de-shielded) for this structure. They are in the range expected for a system with a *directly conjugated* withdrawing group, like Structure I. Thus, this spectrum is internally inconsistent.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**: This spectrum is a perfect match for our prediction for **Structure I (para-Haloacetophenone)**.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Two doublets in the downfield aromatic region, characteristic of a para-substituted ring attached to an electron-withdrawing group.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: A singlet for 3 protons in the characteristic region for an acetyl methyl group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound that satisfies all the initial conditions and provides a chemically consistent 1H NMR spectrum is a para-haloacetophenone. The data in option D perfectly represents the spectrum for this compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
