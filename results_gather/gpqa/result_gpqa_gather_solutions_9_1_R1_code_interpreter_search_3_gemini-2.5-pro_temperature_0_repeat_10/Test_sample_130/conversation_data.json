This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product).

This is the classic preparation of maleic anhydride from maleic acid.\n    *   Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   ¹H NMR: The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, so they appear as a single peak. The given shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of these protons.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: There are two types of carbons: the two equivalent alkene carbons (C=C) and the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). This matches the given data of two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl).\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the Products of the Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\nThe reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride. This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton. Two stereoisomeric products are possible: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n\n*   **Endo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is oriented on the same side (*syn*) as the newly formed double bond (or more accurately, tucked under the diene system in the transition state). This is typically the major, kinetically-favored product.\n*   **Exo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is oriented on the opposite side (*anti*) of the double bond. This is typically the minor, thermodynamically-favored product.\n\nThe problem states a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to the *endo* and *exo* isomers. The major product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Structure and Assign ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the adducts. They have a plane of symmetry passing through the anhydride oxygen, the C=C bond, and the CH₂ bridge.\n\n*   **Proton Types:**\n    1.  **Bridgehead Methyls:** Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet**. Chemical shift is typically low for aliphatic methyls, ~1.0 ppm.\n    2.  **Alkene Methyls:** Four methyl groups on the double bond (C2 and C3). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet**. Being attached to sp² carbons, they are more deshielded than the bridgehead methyls, ~1.7 ppm.\n    3.  **Anhydride Protons (H_a):** Two protons on the fused anhydride ring. They are equivalent by symmetry and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Signal: **2H singlet**. They are alpha to carbonyl groups, so they are deshielded, ~3.5 ppm.\n    4.  **Methylene Bridge Protons:** Two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic (one *syn* to the double bond, one *anti*). They couple to each other, forming an AB quartet (two doublets). The *anti* proton is typically less shielded than the *syn* proton. The problem describes one of these as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**, which we can assign to the *anti* proton (H_anti).\n\n*   **Summary of Signal Assignments:**\n    *   ~1.0 ppm: 6H singlet (Bridgehead -CH₃)\n    *   ~1.7 ppm: 6H singlet (Alkene -CH₃)\n    *   ~3.5 ppm: 2H singlet (Anhydride H_a)\n    *   ~1.5 ppm: 1H doublet (Bridge H_anti)\n\n**Step 4: Use NOESY Data to Distinguish Isomers**\n\nNOESY spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). The problem states a specific cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find which pair of protons fits this description.\n\n*   **Major Product (Endo Isomer):**\n    *   In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is tucked under the C7 bridge. This places the anhydride protons (H_a) in the *exo* position (pointing away from the double bond).\n    *   The methylene bridge has two protons: H_syn (pointing towards the double bond) and H_anti (pointing away from the double bond).\n    *   Crucially, in the *endo* isomer, both the anhydride protons (H_a) and the bridge proton (H_anti) are on the *exo* face of the molecule. They are spatially close.\n    *   **Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak between H_a (~3.5 ppm) and H_anti (~1.5 ppm) is expected for the major (endo) product.**\n\n*   **Minor Product (Exo Isomer):**\n    *   In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the *exo* face. This places the anhydride protons (H_a) in the *endo* position (pointing towards the double bond).\n    *   The bridge proton H_anti is still on the *exo* face.\n    *   In this isomer, H_a (*endo*) and H_anti (*exo*) are on opposite sides of the molecule and are far apart.\n    *   **Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak between H_a and H_anti would be absent or very weak for the minor (exo) product.**\n\nThis analysis perfectly matches the experimental observation described in the problem.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Finding to the Options**\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor product connects:\n*   The anhydride protons (H_a): **a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   The anti-bridge proton (H_anti): **a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's quickly check why other options are incorrect:\n*   A) Me(bridgehead) and Me(alkene) are close in both isomers.\n*   B) Me(bridgehead) and H_anti are close in both isomers.\n*   D) Me(alkene) and H_a are far apart in the major (*endo*) isomer but close in the minor (*exo*) isomer. This is the opposite of the observation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride shows a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, giving one signal at ~7 ppm. The two equivalent alkene carbons (~137 ppm) and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm) give two signals in the ¹³C NMR.\n    *   **Diene:** The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons and a CH₂ group at the 5-position.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic ring system.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Determine the Products (Major and Minor):**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* product.\n    *   The *endo* product is typically the major product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions during the reaction, making it the kinetically favored product. The *exo* product is the minor product.\n    *   Let's visualize the structures using the standard numbering for a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system:\n        *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side as) the C7-methylene bridge. In this arrangement, the two methine protons (H5, H6) from the maleic anhydride part point *towards* the C2=C3 double bond, which bears the four methyl groups.\n        *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is *anti* (on the opposite side of) the C7-methylene bridge. Here, the H5 and H6 protons point *away* from the C2=C3 double bond.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons.\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *endo* isomer but not in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   Based on the structures determined above:\n        *   In the **endo (major) product**, the H5/H6 protons are close to the methyl groups on the C2=C3 double bond. Therefore, a NOE cross-peak between them is expected.\n        *   In the **exo (minor) product**, the H5/H6 protons are far from these methyl groups. A NOE cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n    *   This perfectly matches the experimental observation. The key cross-peak connects the H5/H6 protons with the vinyl methyl protons.\n\n5.  **Assign NMR Signals and Match with Options:**\n    *   **H5/H6 Protons:** These two methine protons are chemically equivalent due to a plane of symmetry. They are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing anhydride group. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** and an integral of **2H** is very reasonable. The option describes this as a \"2H singlet\".\n    *   **Vinyl Methyl Protons:** There are four methyl groups on the double bond. Due to symmetry, they are expected to appear as two distinct sets. Each set contains two methyl groups, leading to two signals, each with an integral of **6H**. A chemical shift of **~1.7 ppm** is appropriate for methyl groups on a double bond in such a system. The option refers to \"A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\".\n    *   **Bridge Protons (C7-H₂):** These two protons are diastereotopic and would likely appear as two distinct signals, probably doublets. The option \"a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\" likely corresponds to one of these bridge protons.\n    *   **Other Methyl Protons:** The other set of vinyl methyls is given as \"A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm\".\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product connects the H5/H6 methine protons with one of the sets of vinyl methyl protons.\n    *   Matching this with the provided options:\n        *   **\"A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\"** corresponds to one set of vinyl methyl groups.\n        *   **\"A 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\"** corresponds to the H5/H6 methine protons.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects these two resonances.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**: First, we need to determine the structures of the two starting materials.\n    *   **Dienophile**: The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This high degree of symmetry points to maleic acid, which dehydrates to form **maleic anhydride**. The NMR data is consistent: the two equivalent alkene protons give a single ¹H peak, and the two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons give two ¹³C peaks.\n    *   **Diene**: The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products**: The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This [4+2] cycloaddition typically yields two major stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The *endo* product, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are tucked under the newly formed ring, is usually the kinetically favored and thus the **major product**. The *exo* product is the **minor product**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Product Structures for NOESY Spectroscopy**: The key to solving the problem lies in understanding the spatial relationships between protons in the two products, which is what a 2D NOESY experiment reveals. A cross-peak in a NOESY spectrum indicates that two sets of protons are physically close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   **Proton Assignments**: Both products have a plane of symmetry. We can identify four main types of protons:\n        1.  **Me_vinyl**: The two methyl groups on the double bond (6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm).\n        2.  **Me_bridgehead**: The two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (6H singlet, ~1.0 ppm).\n        3.  **H_anhydride**: The two protons on the five-membered anhydride ring (2H singlet, deshielded by the adjacent carbonyls to ~3.5 ppm).\n        4.  **H_bridge**: The two protons of the CH₂ bridge.\n    *   **Endo Product (Major)**: In this isomer, the anhydride ring is positioned on the same side as the carbon-carbon double bond. This brings the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the **Me_vinyl** protons (~1.7 ppm). Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor)**: In this isomer, the anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side of the double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far from the **Me_vinyl** protons, so the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak. Instead, they are close to the **Me_bridgehead** protons.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. Based on our analysis, this specific interaction corresponds to the one between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **Me_vinyl** protons in the endo adduct. Matching our chemical shift and integration assignments to the options provided:\n    *   H_anhydride: 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n    *   Me_vinyl: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n\n    This corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# Step 1: Define the problem and the options provided.\nproblem_description = \"\"\"\nA dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. \nThis anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, \nwas reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). \nBoth products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. \nA cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak?\n\"\"\"\n\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\",\n    \"B\": \"A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\",\n    \"C\": \"A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\",\n    \"D\": \"A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\"\n}\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the reaction and products based on chemical principles.\n# Reactants: Maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n# Reaction: Diels-Alder.\n# Products: Endo (major) and Exo (minor) adducts.\n\n# Step 3: Analyze the spatial proximity of protons for NOESY.\n# Proton types and estimated chemical shifts:\n# - Me_vinyl (vinylic methyls): 6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm\n# - Me_bridgehead (bridgehead methyls): 6H singlet, ~1.0 ppm\n# - H_anhydride (protons on anhydride ring): 2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm\n\n# NOE interactions:\n# - In the major (endo) product, H_anhydride protons are close to Me_vinyl protons.\n# - In the minor (exo) product, H_anhydride protons are far from Me_vinyl protons.\n\n# The question asks for the cross-peak present in the major product but absent in the minor.\n# This corresponds to the interaction between H_anhydride and Me_vinyl.\n\n# Step 4: Match the interacting protons to the given options.\n# Interacting protons: H_anhydride (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet) and Me_vinyl (~1.7 ppm, 6H singlet).\n# This matches the description in option B.\n\nfinal_answer = \"B\"\n\n# Step 5: Print the final answer.\nprint(f\"The reasoning leads to the conclusion that the cross-peak in the major product connects the vinylic methyl protons and the anhydride ring protons.\")\nprint(f\"Based on the provided options, the correct choice is:\")\nprint(f\"B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\")\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer Choice: {final_answer}\")\n<<<B>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 52\n    <<<B>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Dienophile**\n\n*   The problem starts with a \"dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene\" which is dehydrated to an anhydride. The ability to form a cyclic anhydride implies the two carboxylic acid groups are on the same side of the molecule. A cis-alkene dicarboxylic acid like maleic acid fits this description perfectly.\n*   The anhydride's NMR data is provided:\n    *   **¹H NMR:** A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** Two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. The peak at ~165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride, and the peak at ~137 ppm is characteristic of an alkene carbon.\n*   This data points unambiguously to **maleic anhydride**. It has a plane of symmetry, making the two alkene protons equivalent (giving one ¹H signal) and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent (one ¹³C signal) and the two alkene carbons equivalent (a second ¹³C signal).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Diene**\n\n*   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds and four methyl groups attached to the sp² hybridized carbons.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n*   This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (C₉H₁₄ from the diene + C₄H₂O₃ from the anhydride), which matches the information given.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the **endo** product and the **exo** product.\n    *   In the **endo** product, the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) is tucked under the newly formed six-membered ring, on the same side as the diene's original π-system (which becomes the double bond in the product). The endo product is usually the kinetically favored, **major product**.\n    *   In the **exo** product, the anhydride ring points away from the double bond. The exo product is usually the thermodynamically favored, **minor product**.\n*   The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to the endo and exo isomers.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Structures and Proton Environments**\n\n*   Let's analyze the protons in the product structure (a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative):\n    1.  **Alkene Methyl Protons:** Two methyl groups are attached to the C=C double bond. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. They will appear as a 6H singlet. Their chemical shift is typically around 1.6-1.8 ppm.\n    2.  **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** Two methyl groups are on the bridgehead carbons (saturated sp³ carbons). They are also equivalent due to symmetry and will appear as a 6H singlet. Their chemical shift is typically lower, around 1.0-1.2 ppm.\n    3.  **Anhydride Protons:** These are the two protons that originated from the maleic anhydride. They are attached to carbons that are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent and will appear as a 2H singlet (coupling to the bridgehead protons is often negligible due to a ~90° dihedral angle). Their chemical shift will be relatively high due to the deshielding effect of the carbonyls, around 3.5 ppm.\n    4.  **Bridge Protons:** The two protons on the CH₂ bridge (C7) are generally not equivalent and would couple to each other, often appearing as a complex multiplet or two doublets. Their chemical shift is typically around 1.5 ppm.\n\n**Step 5: Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two spatially-proximate protons.\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This means we are looking for a spatial interaction that exists in the endo isomer but not in the exo isomer.\n*   Let's compare the spatial arrangement in the two isomers:\n    *   **Endo (Major) Isomer:** The anhydride ring is tucked *under* the C=C double bond. This brings the **anhydride protons** very close to the **alkene methyl protons**.\n    *   **Exo (Minor) Isomer:** The anhydride ring points *away* from the C=C double bond. The anhydride protons are far from the alkene methyl protons.\n*   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major product must be between the **anhydride protons** and the **alkene methyl protons**.\n\n**Step 6: Match the Interacting Protons to the NMR Signals**\n\n*   Based on our chemical shift analysis in Step 4:\n    *   The **alkene methyl protons** correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   The **anhydride protons** correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   The cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects these two signals.\n\n**Step 7: Select the Correct Answer**\n\n*   We are looking for the option that connects a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm with a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n*   Option A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton). Incorrect.\n*   Option B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (alkene methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). **This is the correct answer.**\n*   Option C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). This interaction would be stronger in the exo (minor) product. Incorrect.\n*   Option D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (alkene methyls). These groups are not close enough for a strong NOE. Incorrect.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The dehydration of a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid forms a cyclic anhydride.\n        *   The ¹H NMR shows a single peak, meaning all protons are chemically equivalent.\n        *   The ¹³C NMR shows two peaks, meaning there are only two types of carbon atoms.\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent alkene protons (¹H shift ~7 ppm) and two sets of equivalent carbons: two alkene carbons (¹³C shift ~137 ppm) and two carbonyl carbons (¹³C shift ~165 ppm).\n        *   Structure of maleic anhydride: A five-membered ring with O, C=O, C(H)=C(H), C=O.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on all four carbons of the conjugated diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4). The fifth carbon (C5) is a CH₂ group.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile.\n    *   The reaction of a cyclic diene (cyclopentadiene derivative) results in a bicyclic product with a **bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene** core.\n    *   The product's molecular formula is given as C₁₃H₁₆O₃. Let's verify this:\n        *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). The formula is correct.\n    *   The product structure is **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride**.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n        *   The **endo rule** states that the major product is typically the *endo* isomer, formed through a transition state with favorable secondary orbital interactions. The minor product is the *exo* isomer.\n        *   **Major Product = Endo isomer.**\n        *   **Minor Product = Exo isomer.**\n\n3.  **Analyze the 3D Structures of the Endo and Exo Isomers**\n    *   In the bicyclo[2.2.1] system, substituents on the C5/C6 bridge can be *endo* (pointing towards the C2=C3 double bond) or *exo* (pointing away from the C2=C3 double bond, towards the C7 bridge).\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring itself is in the *endo* position (tucked under the C2=C3 double bond). This means the two protons on C5 and C6 (originating from maleic anhydride) are in the *exo* position. In this orientation, they point towards the C7 bridge. The C7 bridge has two protons, one *syn* to the double bond and one *anti*. The *exo* protons at C5/C6 are spatially close to the *anti* proton on the C7 bridge.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is in the *exo* position. This means the protons on C5 and C6 are in the *endo* position, pointing towards the C2=C3 double bond. In this orientation, they are far from the C7 bridge protons.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states there is a cross-peak in the major product's spectrum that is absent or weak in the minor product's spectrum.\n    *   Based on our structural analysis, the close proximity between the **protons at C5/C6** and the ***anti* proton at C7** is a unique feature of the major (*endo*) isomer. This interaction is absent in the minor (*exo*) isomer.\n    *   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak must connect the signals for these specific protons.\n\n5.  **Assign NMR Signals and Match with Options**\n    *   Let's assign the proton signals described in the options to the protons in the molecule:\n        *   **Protons at C5/C6 (from anhydride):** These two equivalent protons are adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring. Their chemical shift will be significantly downfield. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the correct assignment.\n        *   **Protons at C7 (bridge):** These are two diastereotopic protons on a methylene bridge. They would typically appear as two separate signals, likely doublets due to geminal coupling. A chemical shift around 1-2 ppm is expected. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to one of these bridge protons.\n        *   **Methyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups. The vinylic methyls (at C2/C3) are deshielded relative to the bridgehead methyls (at C1/C4).\n            *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** corresponds to the two vinylic methyl groups.\n            *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm** corresponds to the two bridgehead methyl groups.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The unique NOESY cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects the protons at C5/C6 with one of the C7 bridge protons.\n    *   This corresponds to an interaction between the resonance at **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)** and the resonance at **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)**.\n    *   This matches option D.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). These are far apart in the endo isomer.\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton). These are not uniquely close in the endo isomer.\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls). An NOE might exist, but it would likely be present in both isomers, not a distinguishing feature.\nD) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). This corresponds to the unique spatial proximity in the major (endo) product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   The dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride is maleic acid. The resulting anhydride is maleic anhydride. The NMR data (¹H: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is consistent with the symmetric structure of maleic anhydride.\n    *   The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition, a [4+2] reaction that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n2.  **Determine the Products (Stereoisomers):**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* product.\n    *   The *endo* product is typically the major product because it is formed faster (kinetic control), due to favorable secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n    *   The *exo* product is generally more stable (thermodynamic product) because it is less sterically hindered, but it forms more slowly.\n    *   Since the problem states a major and a minor product are formed, we can identify the major product as the *endo* isomer and the minor product as the *exo* isomer.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structures of the *Endo* and *Exo* Products:**\n    *   The reaction creates a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   There are four methyl groups: two on the bridgehead carbons (let's call them **Me-bridgehead**) and two on the double bond of the new six-membered ring (let's call them **Me-alkene**).\n    *   There are two equivalent protons where the anhydride ring is fused to the bicyclic system (let's call them **H-anhydride**).\n    *   **In the *endo* isomer (major product):** The anhydride ring is tucked under the diene system, on the same side as the newly formed double bond. This places the **H-anhydride** protons in close spatial proximity to the **Me-alkene** groups.\n    *   **In the *exo* isomer (minor product):** The anhydride ring points away from the diene system. This places the **H-anhydride** protons far from the **Me-alkene** groups but close to the **Me-bridgehead** groups.\n\n4.  **Interpret the 2D NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   2D NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent or weak in the minor product.\n    *   This specific cross-peak must correspond to an interaction unique to the *endo* (major) isomer. Based on our structural analysis, this is the interaction between the **H-anhydride** protons and the **Me-alkene** protons.\n\n5.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   We need to assign the chemical shifts and integrals given in the options to the protons in our structure.\n    *   **H-anhydride:** These are two equivalent methine protons, each adjacent to a carbonyl group in a strained ring system. They will be deshielded. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** and an integral of **2H** (as a singlet due to symmetry) is a reasonable assignment.\n    *   **Me-alkene:** These are two equivalent methyl groups attached to a double bond (vinylic methyls). They are deshielded compared to standard alkyl methyls. A chemical shift of **~1.7 ppm** and an integral of **6H** (as a singlet) is a good estimate.\n    *   **Me-bridgehead:** These are two equivalent methyl groups on saturated bridgehead carbons. They are in a more shielded environment. A chemical shift of **~1.0 ppm** and an integral of **6H** (as a singlet) is expected.\n\n6.  **Match the Analysis to the Options:**\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects the **H-anhydride** protons and the **Me-alkene** protons.\n    *   Based on our assignments, this corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\n    *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect integration and multiplicity for the methyl signal.\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect signal for the anhydride protons.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This correctly identifies the alkene methyls and the anhydride protons, which are close in space in the major (*endo*) product.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This would be a cross-peak between the two different sets of methyl groups.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the resonances of the alkene methyl groups and the anhydride bridgehead protons.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The single ¹H NMR peak indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The 7 ppm shift is characteristic of vinylic (alkene) protons.\n        *   The two ¹³C NMR peaks suggest a molecule with two types of carbon atoms. The 165 ppm peak is typical for a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride, and the 137 ppm peak is in the range for an alkene carbon.\n        *   Maleic acid is a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. Its dehydration product, maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃), fits this data perfectly. It has two equivalent vinylic protons and two sets of equivalent carbons (two C=O and two C=C), which explains the observed spectra.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This molecule has a five-membered ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, and a CH₂ group at position 5. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride). This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. Typically, the *endo* product is the kinetically favored major product, while the *exo* product is the thermodynamically more stable minor product. The problem states a major and a minor product are formed, consistent with the formation of both isomers.\n\n3.  **Structure of the Adducts and Proton Assignments:**\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene core structure.\n    *   **Protons and Signals:**\n        *   **Me_bridgehead:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). These are on saturated carbons and will appear as a 6H singlet at a lower chemical shift, estimated around **~1.0 ppm**.\n        *   **Me_alkene:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C2, C3). These vinylic methyls will appear as a 6H singlet at a higher chemical shift, estimated around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **H_A:** Two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (C5, C6). These protons are alpha to carbonyl groups and will be a 2H singlet, shifted downfield to around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **C7 Protons:** The CH₂ bridge has two diastereotopic protons (*syn* and *anti* to the double bond). They will appear as two separate 1H signals, likely doublets due to geminal coupling. Their shift is estimated to be around **~1.5 ppm**.\n\n4.  **NOESY Analysis to Distinguish Isomers:**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). The key to distinguishing the *endo* and *exo* isomers is identifying which protons are brought close together in each configuration.\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C7 bridge. In this orientation, the anhydride protons (H_A) are far from the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene).\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"away\" from the C7 bridge and is on the same side as the double bond. In this orientation, the anhydride protons (H_A) are very close to the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene).\n    *   **The Differentiating Cross-Peak:** The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor product.\n        *   The NOE interaction between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene) is strong and characteristic for the *exo* (minor) isomer.\n        *   Therefore, the absence of this peak is characteristic of the *endo* (major) isomer.\n        *   The question asks for a cross-peak that *is present* in the major product. Let's re-examine the options based on our signal assignments.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **Signal Assignments:**\n        *   6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm → Me_alkene\n        *   2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm → H_A (anhydride protons)\n        *   6H singlet at ~1 ppm → Me_bridgehead\n        *   1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm → C7 bridge proton\n    *   **Option A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene):** The distance between these two sets of methyl groups is significant in both isomers. A strong, differentiating NOE is not expected.\n    *   **Option B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_A):** This corresponds to the interaction between the alkene methyl groups and the anhydride protons. As established, this interaction is characteristic of the *exo* (minor) product. Since the question asks for a cross-peak in the *major* product's spectrum which is absent in the minor, this is the inverse of what is described. However, it is the most significant stereochemical differentiating peak. There might be a misunderstanding in the problem's premise or the common kinetic/thermodynamic product distribution for this specific highly substituted system. Let's reconsider. The *endo* product is the kinetic product due to secondary orbital overlap. The *exo* is the thermodynamic product because it's less sterically hindered. The reaction is likely run under kinetic control, making the *endo* product major. But what if the steric hindrance from the four methyl groups on the diene is so significant that it reverses the usual selectivity, making the *exo* product the major one? If the *exo* product were the major product, then the cross-peak between Me_alkene (~1.7 ppm) and H_A (~3.5 ppm) would be the correct answer. Given the options, this is the most plausible chemical scenario that leads to one of the answers.\n    *   **Option C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_A):** An interaction between H_A and a C7 proton exists in both isomers (with H_anti in *endo* and H_syn in *exo*). It is unlikely to be strongly present in one and completely absent in the other.\n    *   **Option D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 proton):** The distance between the bridgehead methyls and the C7 protons should be similar in both isomers.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The most significant and differentiating NOE interaction is between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene). This interaction is strong in the *exo* isomer and very weak or absent in the *endo* isomer. The question describes a peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor. If we assume the major product is the *exo* isomer (which is plausible due to the steric bulk of the four methyl groups on the diene overriding the usual *endo* preference), then the cross-peak would be between the 6H singlet of the alkene methyls (~1.7 ppm) and the 2H singlet of the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm). This matches option B.\n\nFinal check: The interaction described in B is the most chemically sound for differentiating the two stereoisomers via NOESY. The ambiguity lies in which isomer is major. In many simple cases, *endo* is major. However, with heavily substituted dienes, this can be reversed. Assuming the question and options lead to a correct chemical conclusion, the most logical answer is that the major product is *exo*, and the observed cross-peak is between the spatially proximate alkene methyls and anhydride protons.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe analysis of the chemical problem proceeds in several steps:\n\n1.  **Identifying the Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride shows a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum at 7 ppm and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum (137 ppm and 165 ppm). This spectroscopic data is characteristic of maleic anhydride. The molecule's symmetry makes the two vinylic protons equivalent (giving one ¹H signal) and the two alkene carbons and two carbonyl carbons equivalent (giving two ¹³C signals). The chemical shifts are appropriate for vinylic protons (~7 ppm), alkene carbons (~137 ppm), and carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm).\n\n2.  **Identifying the Reaction:** The anhydride (maleic anhydride) reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a classic [4+2] cycloaddition known as the Diels-Alder reaction. Maleic anhydride acts as the dienophile, and the substituted cyclopentadiene acts as the diene.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Products:** The reaction yields two products, a major and a minor one, both with the molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃. In Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes, two stereoisomeric products can form: the *endo* and the *exo* adduct. The *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored and therefore major product, formed due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. The *exo* product is generally the thermodynamically more stable, but minor, product. Thus, the major product is the *endo* isomer and the minor product is the *exo* isomer.\n\n4.  **Distinguishing Products with NOESY NMR:** A 2D NOESY experiment detects protons that are close to each other in space (through-space correlation), which is ideal for distinguishing between *endo* and *exo* isomers. A cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor one points to a unique spatial relationship in the *endo* isomer.\n\n5.  **Structural and Spectral Analysis:**\n    *   **Symmetry and Proton Signals:** The resulting bicyclic product has a plane of symmetry. This makes the two methyl groups on the double bond equivalent (a 6H singlet), the two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons equivalent (another 6H singlet), and the two protons on the anhydride portion of the ring equivalent (a 2H singlet).\n    *   **Chemical Shift Assignments:**\n        *   The protons on the anhydride part (let's call them H_succinyl) are alpha to carbonyl groups and are typically found around 3.5 ppm. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   The methyl groups on the double bond (Me_alkene) are vinylic methyls and are expected to be more deshielded than saturated methyls. They correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   The methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons (Me_bridgehead) would be further upfield, corresponding to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   The remaining signal, a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**, belongs to one of the protons on the methylene bridge.\n    *   ***Endo* vs. *Exo* Geometry:**\n        *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the newly formed six-membered ring. This geometry brings the H_succinyl protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene, ~1.7 ppm).\n        *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the double bond. In this arrangement, the H_succinyl protons are far from the Me_alkene groups but are close to the methylene bridge protons and the bridgehead methyl groups.\n    *   **The Decisive Cross-Peak:** The NOESY cross-peak observed in the major product but not the minor product must be due to the interaction that is unique to the *endo* geometry. This is the close proximity between the H_succinyl protons and the Me_alkene protons. Therefore, the cross-peak connects the resonance at ~3.5 ppm (2H singlet) and the resonance at ~1.7 ppm (6H singlet).\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl).\n    *   The high symmetry (single ¹H peak, two ¹³C peaks) and the chemical shifts are characteristic of **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has two equivalent alkene protons (¹H singlet ~7.0-7.3 ppm) and two sets of equivalent carbons (alkene carbons ~137 ppm and carbonyl carbons ~165 ppm). This perfectly matches the description.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (C=C-C=C).\n    *   The four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4) each have a methyl group.\n    *   The fifth carbon (C5) is a CH₂ group.\n    *   The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   The product's molecular formula should be the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the formula given for the products, confirming our reactant identification.\n\n**3. Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction with a cyclic diene like cyclopentadiene can produce two stereoisomeric products: the ***endo*** adduct and the ***exo*** adduct.\n*   The **endo rule** predicts that the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction under kinetic control is the *endo* adduct. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the π-system of the dienophile's activating groups (the anhydride part) and the developing double bond in the transition state. The *exo* adduct is typically the minor product.\n*   Let's visualize the structures: The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is positioned on the same side as the newly formed double bond (C(Me)=C(Me)) and on the opposite side of the CH₂ bridge. This means the anhydride protons are *syn* (on the same face) to the alkene's methyl groups.\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is positioned on the same side as the CH₂ bridge and on the opposite side of the double bond. This means the anhydride protons are *anti* (on opposite faces) to the alkene's methyl groups.\n\n**4. Interpret the 2D NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals indicates spatial proximity.\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**.\n*   This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n*   Let's analyze the key proximities:\n    *   **Interaction 1: Anhydride Protons vs. Alkene Methyl Groups.**\n        *   In the **endo** (major) product, the anhydride protons are *syn* to the alkene methyl groups. They are close in space. A **strong NOE** is expected.\n        *   In the **exo** (minor) product, the anhydride protons are *anti* to the alkene methyl groups. They are far apart. **No NOE** is expected.\n    *   **Interaction 2: Anhydride Protons vs. CH₂ Bridge Protons.**\n        *   In the **endo** (major) product, the anhydride protons are *anti* to the CH₂ bridge. They are far apart. **No NOE** is expected.\n        *   In the **exo** (minor) product, the anhydride protons are *syn* to the CH₂ bridge. They are close in space. A **strong NOE** is expected.\n\n*   Since the distinguishing cross-peak is present in the major product (endo), it must be due to the interaction between the **anhydride protons** and the **alkene methyl groups**.\n\n**5. Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\n*   Now we need to match these proton groups to the signals described in the options.\n*   **Anhydride Protons:** There are two of them. Due to the molecule's symmetry, they are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent to bridgehead carbons with no protons, so they will appear as a **singlet**. Their chemical shift, being on a strained ring and alpha to two carbonyl groups, will be relatively high, around 3-4 ppm. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Alkene Methyl Groups:** There are two methyl groups on the double bond. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. This will give a **singlet** with an integral of **6H**. The chemical shift for methyl groups on a double bond is typically around 1.5-2.0 ppm. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyl Groups:** Two equivalent methyl groups on sp³ carbons. This would be a 6H singlet at a lower shift, ~1.0 ppm.\n*   **CH₂ Bridge Protons:** Two diastereotopic protons, likely giving a complex signal (or two doublets) integrating to 2H in the aliphatic region.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\n*   The NOESY cross-peak unique to the major (*endo*) product connects the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl groups.\n*   These correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   This matches option D.\n\nLet's check the other options:\n*   A) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, bridgehead Me) and 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, one bridge H). This interaction would be present in both isomers.\n*   B) 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, one bridge H) and 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm, anhydride H). This interaction is strong in the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) product.\n*   C) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, bridgehead Me) and 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm, alkene Me). This interaction would be present in both isomers.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly identifies the unique NOE cross-peak in the major product is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl C).\n    *   The single ¹H peak indicates that all protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. The shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons in an electron-deficient environment.\n    *   The two ¹³C peaks indicate two types of carbons, consistent with equivalent alkene carbons and equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n    *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by dehydrating maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has two equivalent vinylic protons and a plane of symmetry, leading to the observed simple NMR spectra.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system. It has four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at C5.\n    *   The molecular formula of the diene is C₉H₁₂.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a new six-membered ring.\n*   The product is a bicyclic adduct. The cyclopentadiene ring becomes a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   The *endo* product is usually the major product because it is formed faster (kinetically controlled). This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n    *   The *exo* product is usually the minor product.\n*   The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to the formation of the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Products**\n\n*   Let's draw the structures of the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) adducts.\n    *   The resulting bicyclic system is a derivative of bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene.\n    *   There are methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and on the double bond (C2, C3).\n    *   The anhydride ring is fused at positions C5 and C6.\n    *   There are two protons at C5 and C6, which came from the maleic anhydride.\n    *   There is a CH₂ bridge at C7.\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Major):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C2=C3 double bond.\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Minor):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C2=C3 double bond.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula Check:**\n    *   Diene (C₉H₁₂) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₄O₃).\n    *   The problem states the molecular formula is C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This suggests a subsequent reaction, likely hydrogenation of a double bond, has occurred. However, the chemical shifts provided in the options (especially 1.7 ppm for a methyl group) are characteristic of the un-hydrogenated product (C₁₃H₁₄O₃), where the methyl group is attached to a double bond (vinylic methyl). A methyl group in the hydrogenated product would appear at a much higher field (~1.0-1.2 ppm). This strong contradiction suggests the molecular formula given in the problem is a typo, and we should proceed by analyzing the structure of the direct Diels-Alder adduct, C₁₃H₁₄O₃.\n\n**4. Analyze the NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows correlations between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The question states a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the **major product** but absent (or weak) in the spectrum of the **minor product**. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *endo* adduct but not in the *exo* adduct.\n*   Let's examine the key distances in both isomers:\n    *   **In the *endo* (major) adduct:** The anhydride protons (at C5, C6) are on the same side as the C2=C3 double bond. They are spatially close to the methyl groups on this double bond (at C2, C3). They are far from the C7 bridge.\n    *   **In the *exo* (minor) adduct:** The anhydride protons (at C5, C6) are on the opposite side of the C2=C3 double bond. They are far from the vinylic methyl groups but are now close to the C7 bridge protons.\n*   Therefore, the NOE cross-peak that is strong in the major product and weak/absent in the minor product must be between the **anhydride protons (H₅, H₆)** and the **vinylic methyl groups (Me₂, Me₃)**.\n\n**5. Assign NMR Signals and Match with Options**\n\n*   Let's predict the ¹H NMR signals for the groups involved in this key NOE in the major (*endo*) product. The molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Anhydride protons (H₅, H₆):** These two protons are equivalent due to symmetry. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups and bridgehead carbons. They will appear as a **2H singlet** at a downfield shift, estimated around **~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Vinylic methyl groups (Me₂, Me₃):** These two methyl groups are attached to the double bond and are equivalent by symmetry. They will appear as a **6H singlet**. The typical shift for vinylic methyls is around **~1.7 ppm**.\n*   The NOESY cross-peak should connect these two signals. We are looking for an option that describes a correlation between a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This would be an NOE between a bridge proton (H₇) and the anhydride protons (H₅, H₆), characteristic of the *minor* (exo) product.\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: This would be an NOE between the bridgehead methyls and the vinylic methyls. This interaction is likely present in both isomers and is not the unique feature distinguishing them.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This perfectly matches our prediction for the key NOE in the major (*endo*) product between the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: This would be an NOE between a bridgehead methyl group and a bridge proton.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product arises from the unique spatial proximity of the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups in the *endo* isomer. This corresponds to a NOE between a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Anhydride (Dienophile):** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a single peak at 7.0 ppm. This chemical shift is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). A single peak implies that the vinylic protons are chemically equivalent, which points to a symmetrical molecule.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows two peaks: one at 165 ppm (characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, C=O) and one at 137 ppm (characteristic of a vinylic carbon, C=C). The presence of only two signals for a molecule with at least four carbons confirms a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   The simplest and most common structure that fits all these criteria is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent (giving one ¹H signal) and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, as well as the two vinylic carbons equivalent (giving two ¹³C signals).\n\n*   **The Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring fused to the existing five-membered ring, creating a bicyclic system.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is given as C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which is consistent with the addition of the diene (C₉H₁₄) and the dienophile (C₄H₂O₃).\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the ***endo*** **adduct** and the ***exo*** **adduct**.\n*   According to the **Alder-endo rule**, the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored product, meaning it forms faster and is typically the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically more stable product but forms more slowly, making it the **minor product**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemistry and NOESY Data**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** is a 2D NMR technique that shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically less than 5 Å apart), regardless of whether they are connected by bonds.\n*   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent in the minor product. We must identify a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n\n*   **Visualizing the Adducts:**\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is positioned \"under\" the newly formed cyclohexene ring, on the same side as the C=C double bond. This places the two protons on the anhydride portion of the backbone (let's call them **H_anhydride**) in a position where they point towards the one-carbon bridge (C7) of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is positioned \"away\" from the C=C double bond. This places the **H_anhydride** protons in a position where they point towards the vinylic methyl groups on the C=C double bond and are far from the C7 bridge protons.\n\n*   **Identifying the Key NOE Interaction:**\n    *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the **H_anhydride** protons are spatially close to the protons on the C7 bridge.\n    *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the **H_anhydride** protons are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the NOE cross-peak that is unique to the major product is the one between the **H_anhydride** protons and the protons on the **C7 bridge**.\n\n**4. Assign NMR Signals and Select the Correct Answer**\n\nNow we must assign the proton signals described in the options to the protons in our structure.\n\n*   **H_anhydride:** These two protons are on carbons adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. They will be significantly deshielded. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is appropriate. Due to a plane of symmetry, they are chemically equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**.\n*   **C7 Bridge Protons:** The C7 bridge has two protons that are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments). They will appear as two separate signals, each integrating to 1H. They are coupled to each other, so they will appear as doublets. Being aliphatic protons in a strained ring, a chemical shift of **~1.5 ppm** is reasonable for one of them. This corresponds to a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n*   **Vinylic Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups on the double bond are equivalent. They will appear as a **6H singlet** at a chemical shift of **~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons are equivalent. They are more shielded and will appear as a **6H singlet** at **~1.0 ppm**.\n\nThe unique cross-peak in the major product is between the H_anhydride protons and one of the C7 bridge protons. Based on our assignments, this corresponds to the interaction between:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nThis matches option C.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the other options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls). These groups are not uniquely close in the major product.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride). This interaction is characteristic of the *minor* (*exo*) product.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 bridge proton). This is not the key differentiating feature between the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in its ¹³C spectrum.\n        *   The single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm indicates two chemically equivalent protons in the alkene region.\n        *   The two ¹³C NMR peaks correspond to two types of carbons. The peak at 137 ppm is in the range for alkene carbons (C=C), and the peak at 165 ppm is in the range for anhydride carbonyl carbons (C=O).\n        *   The high symmetry (one type of proton, two types of carbon) and the spectral data perfectly match the structure of **maleic anhydride**. The two alkene protons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent.\n\n    *   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The problem states this is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (C1=C2-C3=C4) and a CH₂ group at C5. Each of the four carbons in the diene system has a methyl group attached.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. Two stereoisomers are formed: a major and a minor product. In Diels-Alder reactions, this typically corresponds to the *endo* and *exo* products. The *endo* product is usually the major product due to favorable secondary orbital overlap in the transition state (kinetic control).\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Products:**\n    *   In the Diels-Alder reaction, the C1 and C4 of the diene react with the two carbons of the dienophile's double bond. A new six-membered ring is formed, and the CH₂ group of the cyclopentadiene becomes a one-carbon bridge (C7) in a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n    *   The resulting product is **1,4,5,6-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride**.\n        *   **Methyl groups:** Two are at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and two are on the double bond (C5, C6).\n        *   **Anhydride ring:** Fused at positions C2 and C3.\n        *   **Protons:** The two protons from the maleic anhydride are now at positions C2 and C3. The CH₂ bridge is at C7.\n\n4.  **Distinguish Between the *Endo* (Major) and *Exo* (Minor) Isomers:**\n    *   The key difference is the stereochemistry of the fused anhydride ring relative to the C5=C6 double bond within the bicyclic system.\n    *   ***Endo* Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C5=C6 double bond. It is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge.\n    *   ***Exo* Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C5=C6 double bond. It is on the same side (*syn*) of the C7 bridge.\n\n5.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectrum and Assign ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   NOESY shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   Let's assign the proton signals given in the options based on typical chemical shifts:\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (at C2 and C3). They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the C5=C6 double bond. Methyl groups on a double bond typically resonate in this region. Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). Saturated alkyl methyl groups resonate here. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is likely one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 bridge.\n\n6.  **Identify the Key NOE Correlation:**\n    *   Let's examine the spatial relationships in the two isomers:\n        *   **In the *endo* (major) product:** The anhydride ring is *syn* to the C5=C6 double bond. This brings the **H_anhydride** protons (at C2, C3) into close proximity with the **Me_alkene** groups (at C5, C6). A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n        *   **In the *exo* (minor) product:** The anhydride ring is *anti* to the C5=C6 double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far from the **Me_alkene** groups. The NOE between them would be absent or very weak. Instead, the H_anhydride protons are now close to the C7 bridge protons.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The NOE cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product must be the one between **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene**.\n    *   This corresponds to the resonances at **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)** and **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)**.\n    *   Looking at the options, this matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**1. Identification of Reactants**\n\n*   **Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm for the alkene carbons and 165 ppm for the carbonyl carbons) in its ¹³C spectrum. This spectroscopic data is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is specified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. The Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n*   This reaction is known to produce two stereoisomeric products: an *endo* and an *exo* adduct.\n*   According to the Alder endo rule, the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product, while the *exo* product is the minor, thermodynamically favored product. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed.\n\n**3. Structure and NMR of the Products**\n\n*   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework. The reaction of the symmetric diene and symmetric dienophile results in a product with a plane of symmetry.\n*   The molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃ is consistent with the addition of C₉H₁₄ (diene) and C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride).\n*   Based on the structure, we can predict the ¹H NMR signals:\n    *   **Two equivalent vinylic methyl groups:** A singlet for 6 protons, typically around 1.7 ppm.\n    *   **Two equivalent bridgehead methyl groups:** A singlet for 6 protons, in a more shielded environment, around 1.0 ppm.\n    *   **Two equivalent protons from the anhydride part:** A singlet for 2 protons, deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups, around 3.5 ppm.\n    *   **Two methylene bridge protons:** These two protons are diastereotopic (one is *syn* or \"up\" and the other is *anti* or \"down\" relative to the double bond). They are not chemically equivalent and will couple to each other, appearing as two separate doublets. Their chemical shifts are typically around 1.3-1.5 ppm.\n*   This predicted spectrum (two 6H singlets, one 2H singlet, and two 1H doublets) is consistent with the signals described in the options.\n\n**4. Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that is unique to the *endo* isomer.\n*   **In the *endo* isomer:** The anhydride ring is tucked underneath the carbon-carbon double bond of the bicycloheptene system. This geometry brings the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm).\n*   **In the *exo* isomer:** The anhydride ring is oriented away from the double bond. In this arrangement, the anhydride protons are far from the vinylic methyl groups.\n*   Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons is a definitive characteristic of the *endo* adduct and will be absent in the *exo* adduct.\n\n**5.

Due to the molecule's symmetry, they are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**. They are adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, so their chemical shift will be downfield, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Methyl Protons:** There are two sets of methyl groups.\n            *   **Vinyl Methyls:** Two methyl groups are attached to the carbons of the double bond.

This will result in a NOESY cross-peak.\n    *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride protons are far from the CH₂ bridge protons. This NOE interaction will be absent or very weak.\n\n4.  **Signal Assignment from the Question**:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: This chemical shift is characteristic of the protons on the anhydride ring, which are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**: This signal corresponds to one of the protons of the CH₂ bridge. The bridge protons are diastereotopic and would couple to each other (geminal coupling), appearing as doublets.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: Likely the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**: Likely the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The question states that a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent in the minor product. This uniquely identifying cross-peak must be the one connecting the protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer. This corresponds to the interaction between the anhydride protons and the bridge protons.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the signal for the anhydride protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and the signal for one of the bridge protons (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm).\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The anhydride's spectroscopic data (¹H NMR: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is a classic signature for **maleic anhydride**. The molecule's symmetry makes the two vinylic protons equivalent (one ¹H signal) and creates two sets of equivalent carbons (two vinylic carbons and two carbonyl carbons), resulting in two ¹³C signals.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   The reaction produces two stereoisomeric products, a major and a minor one. These are the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is consistent with the addition of the diene (C₉H₁₄) and the dienophile (C₄H₂O₃).\n\n**Step 3: Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on the product's bicyclic structure and the typical chemical shifts, we can assign the signals mentioned in the options:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule. They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (vinylic methyls). Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (C7). Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Stereochemistry and the Key NOESY Interaction**\n\nThis is the most critical step. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space (< 5 Å). We need to find a spatial proximity that exists in the major product but not the minor one.\n\n*   **The Endo Rule and Its Exception:** The Alder endo rule states that the *endo* adduct is typically the major (kinetic) product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   In the **true *endo* adduct**, the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge. This places the **H_anhydride** protons close to the **H_bridge** protons.\n    *   In the **true *exo* adduct**, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. This places the **H_anhydride** protons close to the **Me_alkene** groups.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The diene in this problem is heavily substituted with four methyl groups. This creates significant steric hindrance. The *endo* transition state, where the anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the diene, would be highly disfavored due to clashes with the methyl groups. In such cases, the steric effect often overrides the electronic preference, and the **exo adduct becomes the major product**.\n\n*   **Identifying the Cross-Peak:**\n    1.  Assuming the exception applies and the **major product is the *exo* adduct**.\n    2.  The unique spatial proximity in the *exo* adduct is between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **Me_alkene** groups.\n    3.  Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product (exo) but absent in the minor product (endo) will connect these two signals.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Interaction to the Options**\n\n*   The key interaction in the major (*exo*) product is between **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene**.\n*   Based on our signal assignments in Step 3, this corresponds to a cross-peak between:\n    *   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H_anhydride)\n    *   The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (Me_alkene)\n\n*   This combination matches option B.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition. Due to significant steric hindrance from the four methyl groups on the diene, the normal endo selectivity is reversed, and the *exo* adduct is the major product. In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride protons are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups, giving rise to a unique NOESY cross-peak. This cross-peak connects the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n\n<<<B>>>",

This is the classic preparation of maleic anhydride from maleic acid.\n    *   Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   ¹H NMR: The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, so they appear as a single peak. The given shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of these protons.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: There are two types of carbons: the two equivalent alkene carbons (C=C) and the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). This matches the given data of two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl).\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the Products of the Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\nThe reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride. This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton. Two stereoisomeric products are possible: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n\n*   **Endo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is oriented on the same side (*syn*) as the newly formed double bond (or more accurately, tucked under the diene system in the transition state). This is typically the major, kinetically-favored product.\n*   **Exo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is oriented on the opposite side (*anti*) of the double bond. This is typically the minor, thermodynamically-favored product.\n\nThe problem states a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to the *endo* and *exo* isomers. The major product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Structure and Assign ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the adducts. They have a plane of symmetry passing through the anhydride oxygen, the C=C bond, and the CH₂ bridge.\n\n*   **Proton Types:**\n    1.  **Bridgehead Methyls:** Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet**. Chemical shift is typically low for aliphatic methyls, ~1.0 ppm.\n    2.  **Alkene Methyls:** Four methyl groups on the double bond (C2 and C3). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet**. Being attached to sp² carbons, they are more deshielded than the bridgehead methyls, ~1.7 ppm.\n    3.  **Anhydride Protons (H_a):** Two protons on the fused anhydride ring. They are equivalent by symmetry and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Signal: **2H singlet**. They are alpha to carbonyl groups, so they are deshielded, ~3.5 ppm.\n    4.  **Methylene Bridge Protons:** Two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic (one *syn* to the double bond, one *anti*). They couple to each other, forming an AB quartet (two doublets). The *anti* proton is typically less shielded than the *syn* proton. The problem describes one of these as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**, which we can assign to the *anti* proton (H_anti).\n\n*   **Summary of Signal Assignments:**\n    *   ~1.0 ppm: 6H singlet (Bridgehead -CH₃)\n    *   ~1.7 ppm: 6H singlet (Alkene -CH₃)\n    *   ~3.5 ppm: 2H singlet (Anhydride H_a)\n    *   ~1.5 ppm: 1H doublet (Bridge H_anti)\n\n**Step 4: Use NOESY Data to Distinguish Isomers**\n\nNOESY spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). The problem states a specific cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find which pair of protons fits this description.\n\n*   **Major Product (Endo Isomer):**\n    *   In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is tucked under the C7 bridge. This places the anhydride protons (H_a) in the *exo* position (pointing away from the double bond).\n    *   The methylene bridge has two protons: H_syn (pointing towards the double bond) and H_anti (pointing away from the double bond).\n    *   Crucially, in the *endo* isomer, both the anhydride protons (H_a) and the bridge proton (H_anti) are on the *exo* face of the molecule. They are spatially close.\n    *   **Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak between H_a (~3.5 ppm) and H_anti (~1.5 ppm) is expected for the major (endo) product.**\n\n*   **Minor Product (Exo Isomer):**\n    *   In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the *exo* face. This places the anhydride protons (H_a) in the *endo* position (pointing towards the double bond).\n    *   The bridge proton H_anti is still on the *exo* face.\n    *   In this isomer, H_a (*endo*) and H_anti (*exo*) are on opposite sides of the molecule and are far apart.\n    *   **Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak between H_a and H_anti would be absent or very weak for the minor (exo) product.**\n\nThis analysis perfectly matches the experimental observation described in the problem.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Finding to the Options**\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor product connects:\n*   The anhydride protons (H_a): **a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   The anti-bridge proton (H_anti): **a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's quickly check why other options are incorrect:\n*   A) Me(bridgehead) and Me(alkene) are close in both isomers.\n*   B) Me(bridgehead) and H_anti are close in both isomers.\n*   D) Me(alkene) and H_a are far apart in the major (*endo*) isomer but close in the minor (*exo*) isomer. This is the opposite of the observation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride shows a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, giving one signal at ~7 ppm. The two equivalent alkene carbons (~137 ppm) and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm) give two signals in the ¹³C NMR.\n    *   **Diene:** The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons and a CH₂ group at the 5-position.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic ring system.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Determine the Products (Major and Minor):**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* product.\n    *   The *endo* product is typically the major product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions during the reaction, making it the kinetically favored product. The *exo* product is the minor product.\n    *   Let's visualize the structures using the standard numbering for a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system:\n        *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side as) the C7-methylene bridge. In this arrangement, the two methine protons (H5, H6) from the maleic anhydride part point *towards* the C2=C3 double bond, which bears the four methyl groups.\n        *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is *anti* (on the opposite side of) the C7-methylene bridge. Here, the H5 and H6 protons point *away* from the C2=C3 double bond.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons.\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *endo* isomer but not in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   Based on the structures determined above:\n        *   In the **endo (major) product**, the H5/H6 protons are close to the methyl groups on the C2=C3 double bond. Therefore, a NOE cross-peak between them is expected.\n        *   In the **exo (minor) product**, the H5/H6 protons are far from these methyl groups. A NOE cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n    *   This perfectly matches the experimental observation. The key cross-peak connects the H5/H6 protons with the vinyl methyl protons.\n\n5.  **Assign NMR Signals and Match with Options:**\n    *   **H5/H6 Protons:** These two methine protons are chemically equivalent due to a plane of symmetry. They are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing anhydride group. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** and an integral of **2H** is very reasonable. The option describes this as a \"2H singlet\".\n    *   **Vinyl Methyl Protons:** There are four methyl groups on the double bond. Due to symmetry, they are expected to appear as two distinct sets. Each set contains two methyl groups, leading to two signals, each with an integral of **6H**. A chemical shift of **~1.7 ppm** is appropriate for methyl groups on a double bond in such a system. The option refers to \"A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\".\n    *   **Bridge Protons (C7-H₂):** These two protons are diastereotopic and would likely appear as two distinct signals, probably doublets. The option \"a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\" likely corresponds to one of these bridge protons.\n    *   **Other Methyl Protons:** The other set of vinyl methyls is given as \"A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm\".\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product connects the H5/H6 methine protons with one of the sets of vinyl methyl protons.\n    *   Matching this with the provided options:\n        *   **\"A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\"** corresponds to one set of vinyl methyl groups.\n        *   **\"A 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\"** corresponds to the H5/H6 methine protons.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects these two resonances.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**: First, we need to determine the structures of the two starting materials.\n    *   **Dienophile**: The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This high degree of symmetry points to maleic acid, which dehydrates to form **maleic anhydride**. The NMR data is consistent: the two equivalent alkene protons give a single ¹H peak, and the two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons give two ¹³C peaks.\n    *   **Diene**: The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products**: The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This [4+2] cycloaddition typically yields two major stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The *endo* product, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are tucked under the newly formed ring, is usually the kinetically favored and thus the **major product**. The *exo* product is the **minor product**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Product Structures for NOESY Spectroscopy**: The key to solving the problem lies in understanding the spatial relationships between protons in the two products, which is what a 2D NOESY experiment reveals. A cross-peak in a NOESY spectrum indicates that two sets of protons are physically close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   **Proton Assignments**: Both products have a plane of symmetry. We can identify four main types of protons:\n        1.  **Me_vinyl**: The two methyl groups on the double bond (6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm).\n        2.  **Me_bridgehead**: The two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (6H singlet, ~1.0 ppm).\n        3.  **H_anhydride**: The two protons on the five-membered anhydride ring (2H singlet, deshielded by the adjacent carbonyls to ~3.5 ppm).\n        4.  **H_bridge**: The two protons of the CH₂ bridge.\n    *   **Endo Product (Major)**: In this isomer, the anhydride ring is positioned on the same side as the carbon-carbon double bond. This brings the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the **Me_vinyl** protons (~1.7 ppm). Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor)**: In this isomer, the anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side of the double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far from the **Me_vinyl** protons, so the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak. Instead, they are close to the **Me_bridgehead** protons.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. Based on our analysis, this specific interaction corresponds to the one between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **Me_vinyl** protons in the endo adduct. Matching our chemical shift and integration assignments to the options provided:\n    *   H_anhydride: 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n    *   Me_vinyl: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n\n    This corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# Step 1: Define the problem and the options provided.\nproblem_description = \"\"\"\nA dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. \nThis anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, \nwas reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). \nBoth products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. \nA cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak?\n\"\"\"\n\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\",\n    \"B\": \"A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\",\n    \"C\": \"A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\",\n    \"D\": \"A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\"\n}\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the reaction and products based on chemical principles.\n# Reactants: Maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n# Reaction: Diels-Alder.\n# Products: Endo (major) and Exo (minor) adducts.\n\n# Step 3: Analyze the spatial proximity of protons for NOESY.\n# Proton types and estimated chemical shifts:\n# - Me_vinyl (vinylic methyls): 6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm\n# - Me_bridgehead (bridgehead methyls): 6H singlet, ~1.0 ppm\n# - H_anhydride (protons on anhydride ring): 2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm\n\n# NOE interactions:\n# - In the major (endo) product, H_anhydride protons are close to Me_vinyl protons.\n# - In the minor (exo) product, H_anhydride protons are far from Me_vinyl protons.\n\n# The question asks for the cross-peak present in the major product but absent in the minor.\n# This corresponds to the interaction between H_anhydride and Me_vinyl.\n\n# Step 4: Match the interacting protons to the given options.\n# Interacting protons: H_anhydride (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet) and Me_vinyl (~1.7 ppm, 6H singlet).\n# This matches the description in option B.\n\nfinal_answer = \"B\"\n\n# Step 5: Print the final answer.\nprint(f\"The reasoning leads to the conclusion that the cross-peak in the major product connects the vinylic methyl protons and the anhydride ring protons.\")\nprint(f\"Based on the provided options, the correct choice is:\")\nprint(f\"B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\")\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer Choice: {final_answer}\")\n<<<B>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 52\n    <<<B>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Dienophile**\n\n*   The problem starts with a \"dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene\" which is dehydrated to an anhydride. The ability to form a cyclic anhydride implies the two carboxylic acid groups are on the same side of the molecule. A cis-alkene dicarboxylic acid like maleic acid fits this description perfectly.\n*   The anhydride's NMR data is provided:\n    *   **¹H NMR:** A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** Two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. The peak at ~165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride, and the peak at ~137 ppm is characteristic of an alkene carbon.\n*   This data points unambiguously to **maleic anhydride**. It has a plane of symmetry, making the two alkene protons equivalent (giving one ¹H signal) and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent (one ¹³C signal) and the two alkene carbons equivalent (a second ¹³C signal).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Diene**\n\n*   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds and four methyl groups attached to the sp² hybridized carbons.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n*   This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (C₉H₁₄ from the diene + C₄H₂O₃ from the anhydride), which matches the information given.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the **endo** product and the **exo** product.\n    *   In the **endo** product, the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) is tucked under the newly formed six-membered ring, on the same side as the diene's original π-system (which becomes the double bond in the product). The endo product is usually the kinetically favored, **major product**.\n    *   In the **exo** product, the anhydride ring points away from the double bond. The exo product is usually the thermodynamically favored, **minor product**.\n*   The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to the endo and exo isomers.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Structures and Proton Environments**\n\n*   Let's analyze the protons in the product structure (a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative):\n    1.  **Alkene Methyl Protons:** Two methyl groups are attached to the C=C double bond. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. They will appear as a 6H singlet. Their chemical shift is typically around 1.6-1.8 ppm.\n    2.  **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** Two methyl groups are on the bridgehead carbons (saturated sp³ carbons). They are also equivalent due to symmetry and will appear as a 6H singlet. Their chemical shift is typically lower, around 1.0-1.2 ppm.\n    3.  **Anhydride Protons:** These are the two protons that originated from the maleic anhydride. They are attached to carbons that are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent and will appear as a 2H singlet (coupling to the bridgehead protons is often negligible due to a ~90° dihedral angle). Their chemical shift will be relatively high due to the deshielding effect of the carbonyls, around 3.5 ppm.\n    4.  **Bridge Protons:** The two protons on the CH₂ bridge (C7) are generally not equivalent and would couple to each other, often appearing as a complex multiplet or two doublets. Their chemical shift is typically around 1.5 ppm.\n\n**Step 5: Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two spatially-proximate protons.\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This means we are looking for a spatial interaction that exists in the endo isomer but not in the exo isomer.\n*   Let's compare the spatial arrangement in the two isomers:\n    *   **Endo (Major) Isomer:** The anhydride ring is tucked *under* the C=C double bond. This brings the **anhydride protons** very close to the **alkene methyl protons**.\n    *   **Exo (Minor) Isomer:** The anhydride ring points *away* from the C=C double bond. The anhydride protons are far from the alkene methyl protons.\n*   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major product must be between the **anhydride protons** and the **alkene methyl protons**.\n\n**Step 6: Match the Interacting Protons to the NMR Signals**\n\n*   Based on our chemical shift analysis in Step 4:\n    *   The **alkene methyl protons** correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   The **anhydride protons** correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   The cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects these two signals.\n\n**Step 7: Select the Correct Answer**\n\n*   We are looking for the option that connects a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm with a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n*   Option A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton). Incorrect.\n*   Option B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (alkene methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). **This is the correct answer.**\n*   Option C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). This interaction would be stronger in the exo (minor) product. Incorrect.\n*   Option D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (alkene methyls). These groups are not close enough for a strong NOE. Incorrect.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The dehydration of a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid forms a cyclic anhydride.\n        *   The ¹H NMR shows a single peak, meaning all protons are chemically equivalent.\n        *   The ¹³C NMR shows two peaks, meaning there are only two types of carbon atoms.\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent alkene protons (¹H shift ~7 ppm) and two sets of equivalent carbons: two alkene carbons (¹³C shift ~137 ppm) and two carbonyl carbons (¹³C shift ~165 ppm).\n        *   Structure of maleic anhydride: A five-membered ring with O, C=O, C(H)=C(H), C=O.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on all four carbons of the conjugated diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4). The fifth carbon (C5) is a CH₂ group.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile.\n    *   The reaction of a cyclic diene (cyclopentadiene derivative) results in a bicyclic product with a **bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene** core.\n    *   The product's molecular formula is given as C₁₃H₁₆O₃. Let's verify this:\n        *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). The formula is correct.\n    *   The product structure is **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride**.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n        *   The **endo rule** states that the major product is typically the *endo* isomer, formed through a transition state with favorable secondary orbital interactions. The minor product is the *exo* isomer.\n        *   **Major Product = Endo isomer.**\n        *   **Minor Product = Exo isomer.**\n\n3.  **Analyze the 3D Structures of the Endo and Exo Isomers**\n    *   In the bicyclo[2.2.1] system, substituents on the C5/C6 bridge can be *endo* (pointing towards the C2=C3 double bond) or *exo* (pointing away from the C2=C3 double bond, towards the C7 bridge).\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring itself is in the *endo* position (tucked under the C2=C3 double bond). This means the two protons on C5 and C6 (originating from maleic anhydride) are in the *exo* position. In this orientation, they point towards the C7 bridge. The C7 bridge has two protons, one *syn* to the double bond and one *anti*. The *exo* protons at C5/C6 are spatially close to the *anti* proton on the C7 bridge.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is in the *exo* position. This means the protons on C5 and C6 are in the *endo* position, pointing towards the C2=C3 double bond. In this orientation, they are far from the C7 bridge protons.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states there is a cross-peak in the major product's spectrum that is absent or weak in the minor product's spectrum.\n    *   Based on our structural analysis, the close proximity between the **protons at C5/C6** and the ***anti* proton at C7** is a unique feature of the major (*endo*) isomer. This interaction is absent in the minor (*exo*) isomer.\n    *   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak must connect the signals for these specific protons.\n\n5.  **Assign NMR Signals and Match with Options**\n    *   Let's assign the proton signals described in the options to the protons in the molecule:\n        *   **Protons at C5/C6 (from anhydride):** These two equivalent protons are adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring. Their chemical shift will be significantly downfield. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the correct assignment.\n        *   **Protons at C7 (bridge):** These are two diastereotopic protons on a methylene bridge. They would typically appear as two separate signals, likely doublets due to geminal coupling. A chemical shift around 1-2 ppm is expected. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to one of these bridge protons.\n        *   **Methyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups. The vinylic methyls (at C2/C3) are deshielded relative to the bridgehead methyls (at C1/C4).\n            *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** corresponds to the two vinylic methyl groups.\n            *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm** corresponds to the two bridgehead methyl groups.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The unique NOESY cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects the protons at C5/C6 with one of the C7 bridge protons.\n    *   This corresponds to an interaction between the resonance at **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)** and the resonance at **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)**.\n    *   This matches option D.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). These are far apart in the endo isomer.\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton). These are not uniquely close in the endo isomer.\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls). An NOE might exist, but it would likely be present in both isomers, not a distinguishing feature.\nD) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). This corresponds to the unique spatial proximity in the major (endo) product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   The dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride is maleic acid. The resulting anhydride is maleic anhydride. The NMR data (¹H: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is consistent with the symmetric structure of maleic anhydride.\n    *   The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition, a [4+2] reaction that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n2.  **Determine the Products (Stereoisomers):**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* product.\n    *   The *endo* product is typically the major product because it is formed faster (kinetic control), due to favorable secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n    *   The *exo* product is generally more stable (thermodynamic product) because it is less sterically hindered, but it forms more slowly.\n    *   Since the problem states a major and a minor product are formed, we can identify the major product as the *endo* isomer and the minor product as the *exo* isomer.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structures of the *Endo* and *Exo* Products:**\n    *   The reaction creates a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   There are four methyl groups: two on the bridgehead carbons (let's call them **Me-bridgehead**) and two on the double bond of the new six-membered ring (let's call them **Me-alkene**).\n    *   There are two equivalent protons where the anhydride ring is fused to the bicyclic system (let's call them **H-anhydride**).\n    *   **In the *endo* isomer (major product):** The anhydride ring is tucked under the diene system, on the same side as the newly formed double bond. This places the **H-anhydride** protons in close spatial proximity to the **Me-alkene** groups.\n    *   **In the *exo* isomer (minor product):** The anhydride ring points away from the diene system. This places the **H-anhydride** protons far from the **Me-alkene** groups but close to the **Me-bridgehead** groups.\n\n4.  **Interpret the 2D NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   2D NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent or weak in the minor product.\n    *   This specific cross-peak must correspond to an interaction unique to the *endo* (major) isomer. Based on our structural analysis, this is the interaction between the **H-anhydride** protons and the **Me-alkene** protons.\n\n5.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   We need to assign the chemical shifts and integrals given in the options to the protons in our structure.\n    *   **H-anhydride:** These are two equivalent methine protons, each adjacent to a carbonyl group in a strained ring system. They will be deshielded. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** and an integral of **2H** (as a singlet due to symmetry) is a reasonable assignment.\n    *   **Me-alkene:** These are two equivalent methyl groups attached to a double bond (vinylic methyls). They are deshielded compared to standard alkyl methyls. A chemical shift of **~1.7 ppm** and an integral of **6H** (as a singlet) is a good estimate.\n    *   **Me-bridgehead:** These are two equivalent methyl groups on saturated bridgehead carbons. They are in a more shielded environment. A chemical shift of **~1.0 ppm** and an integral of **6H** (as a singlet) is expected.\n\n6.  **Match the Analysis to the Options:**\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects the **H-anhydride** protons and the **Me-alkene** protons.\n    *   Based on our assignments, this corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\n    *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect integration and multiplicity for the methyl signal.\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect signal for the anhydride protons.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This correctly identifies the alkene methyls and the anhydride protons, which are close in space in the major (*endo*) product.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This would be a cross-peak between the two different sets of methyl groups.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the resonances of the alkene methyl groups and the anhydride bridgehead protons.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The single ¹H NMR peak indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The 7 ppm shift is characteristic of vinylic (alkene) protons.\n        *   The two ¹³C NMR peaks suggest a molecule with two types of carbon atoms. The 165 ppm peak is typical for a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride, and the 137 ppm peak is in the range for an alkene carbon.\n        *   Maleic acid is a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. Its dehydration product, maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃), fits this data perfectly. It has two equivalent vinylic protons and two sets of equivalent carbons (two C=O and two C=C), which explains the observed spectra.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This molecule has a five-membered ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, and a CH₂ group at position 5. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride). This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. Typically, the *endo* product is the kinetically favored major product, while the *exo* product is the thermodynamically more stable minor product. The problem states a major and a minor product are formed, consistent with the formation of both isomers.\n\n3.  **Structure of the Adducts and Proton Assignments:**\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene core structure.\n    *   **Protons and Signals:**\n        *   **Me_bridgehead:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). These are on saturated carbons and will appear as a 6H singlet at a lower chemical shift, estimated around **~1.0 ppm**.\n        *   **Me_alkene:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C2, C3). These vinylic methyls will appear as a 6H singlet at a higher chemical shift, estimated around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **H_A:** Two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (C5, C6). These protons are alpha to carbonyl groups and will be a 2H singlet, shifted downfield to around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **C7 Protons:** The CH₂ bridge has two diastereotopic protons (*syn* and *anti* to the double bond). They will appear as two separate 1H signals, likely doublets due to geminal coupling. Their shift is estimated to be around **~1.5 ppm**.\n\n4.  **NOESY Analysis to Distinguish Isomers:**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). The key to distinguishing the *endo* and *exo* isomers is identifying which protons are brought close together in each configuration.\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C7 bridge. In this orientation, the anhydride protons (H_A) are far from the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene).\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"away\" from the C7 bridge and is on the same side as the double bond. In this orientation, the anhydride protons (H_A) are very close to the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene).\n    *   **The Differentiating Cross-Peak:** The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor product.\n        *   The NOE interaction between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene) is strong and characteristic for the *exo* (minor) isomer.\n        *   Therefore, the absence of this peak is characteristic of the *endo* (major) isomer.\n        *   The question asks for a cross-peak that *is present* in the major product. Let's re-examine the options based on our signal assignments.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **Signal Assignments:**\n        *   6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm → Me_alkene\n        *   2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm → H_A (anhydride protons)\n        *   6H singlet at ~1 ppm → Me_bridgehead\n        *   1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm → C7 bridge proton\n    *   **Option A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene):** The distance between these two sets of methyl groups is significant in both isomers. A strong, differentiating NOE is not expected.\n    *   **Option B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_A):** This corresponds to the interaction between the alkene methyl groups and the anhydride protons. As established, this interaction is characteristic of the *exo* (minor) product. Since the question asks for a cross-peak in the *major* product's spectrum which is absent in the minor, this is the inverse of what is described. However, it is the most significant stereochemical differentiating peak. There might be a misunderstanding in the problem's premise or the common kinetic/thermodynamic product distribution for this specific highly substituted system. Let's reconsider. The *endo* product is the kinetic product due to secondary orbital overlap. The *exo* is the thermodynamic product because it's less sterically hindered. The reaction is likely run under kinetic control, making the *endo* product major. But what if the steric hindrance from the four methyl groups on the diene is so significant that it reverses the usual selectivity, making the *exo* product the major one? If the *exo* product were the major product, then the cross-peak between Me_alkene (~1.7 ppm) and H_A (~3.5 ppm) would be the correct answer. Given the options, this is the most plausible chemical scenario that leads to one of the answers.\n    *   **Option C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_A):** An interaction between H_A and a C7 proton exists in both isomers (with H_anti in *endo* and H_syn in *exo*). It is unlikely to be strongly present in one and completely absent in the other.\n    *   **Option D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 proton):** The distance between the bridgehead methyls and the C7 protons should be similar in both isomers.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The most significant and differentiating NOE interaction is between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene). This interaction is strong in the *exo* isomer and very weak or absent in the *endo* isomer. The question describes a peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor. If we assume the major product is the *exo* isomer (which is plausible due to the steric bulk of the four methyl groups on the diene overriding the usual *endo* preference), then the cross-peak would be between the 6H singlet of the alkene methyls (~1.7 ppm) and the 2H singlet of the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm). This matches option B.\n\nFinal check: The interaction described in B is the most chemically sound for differentiating the two stereoisomers via NOESY. The ambiguity lies in which isomer is major. In many simple cases, *endo* is major. However, with heavily substituted dienes, this can be reversed. Assuming the question and options lead to a correct chemical conclusion, the most logical answer is that the major product is *exo*, and the observed cross-peak is between the spatially proximate alkene methyls and anhydride protons.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe analysis of the chemical problem proceeds in several steps:\n\n1.  **Identifying the Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride shows a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum at 7 ppm and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum (137 ppm and 165 ppm). This spectroscopic data is characteristic of maleic anhydride. The molecule's symmetry makes the two vinylic protons equivalent (giving one ¹H signal) and the two alkene carbons and two carbonyl carbons equivalent (giving two ¹³C signals). The chemical shifts are appropriate for vinylic protons (~7 ppm), alkene carbons (~137 ppm), and carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm).\n\n2.  **Identifying the Reaction:** The anhydride (maleic anhydride) reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a classic [4+2] cycloaddition known as the Diels-Alder reaction. Maleic anhydride acts as the dienophile, and the substituted cyclopentadiene acts as the diene.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Products:** The reaction yields two products, a major and a minor one, both with the molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃. In Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes, two stereoisomeric products can form: the *endo* and the *exo* adduct. The *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored and therefore major product, formed due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. The *exo* product is generally the thermodynamically more stable, but minor, product. Thus, the major product is the *endo* isomer and the minor product is the *exo* isomer.\n\n4.  **Distinguishing Products with NOESY NMR:** A 2D NOESY experiment detects protons that are close to each other in space (through-space correlation), which is ideal for distinguishing between *endo* and *exo* isomers. A cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor one points to a unique spatial relationship in the *endo* isomer.\n\n5.  **Structural and Spectral Analysis:**\n    *   **Symmetry and Proton Signals:** The resulting bicyclic product has a plane of symmetry. This makes the two methyl groups on the double bond equivalent (a 6H singlet), the two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons equivalent (another 6H singlet), and the two protons on the anhydride portion of the ring equivalent (a 2H singlet).\n    *   **Chemical Shift Assignments:**\n        *   The protons on the anhydride part (let's call them H_succinyl) are alpha to carbonyl groups and are typically found around 3.5 ppm. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   The methyl groups on the double bond (Me_alkene) are vinylic methyls and are expected to be more deshielded than saturated methyls. They correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   The methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons (Me_bridgehead) would be further upfield, corresponding to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   The remaining signal, a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**, belongs to one of the protons on the methylene bridge.\n    *   ***Endo* vs. *Exo* Geometry:**\n        *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the newly formed six-membered ring. This geometry brings the H_succinyl protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene, ~1.7 ppm).\n        *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the double bond. In this arrangement, the H_succinyl protons are far from the Me_alkene groups but are close to the methylene bridge protons and the bridgehead methyl groups.\n    *   **The Decisive Cross-Peak:** The NOESY cross-peak observed in the major product but not the minor product must be due to the interaction that is unique to the *endo* geometry. This is the close proximity between the H_succinyl protons and the Me_alkene protons. Therefore, the cross-peak connects the resonance at ~3.5 ppm (2H singlet) and the resonance at ~1.7 ppm (6H singlet).\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl).\n    *   The high symmetry (single ¹H peak, two ¹³C peaks) and the chemical shifts are characteristic of **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has two equivalent alkene protons (¹H singlet ~7.0-7.3 ppm) and two sets of equivalent carbons (alkene carbons ~137 ppm and carbonyl carbons ~165 ppm). This perfectly matches the description.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (C=C-C=C).\n    *   The four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4) each have a methyl group.\n    *   The fifth carbon (C5) is a CH₂ group.\n    *   The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   The product's molecular formula should be the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the formula given for the products, confirming our reactant identification.\n\n**3. Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction with a cyclic diene like cyclopentadiene can produce two stereoisomeric products: the ***endo*** adduct and the ***exo*** adduct.\n*   The **endo rule** predicts that the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction under kinetic control is the *endo* adduct. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the π-system of the dienophile's activating groups (the anhydride part) and the developing double bond in the transition state. The *exo* adduct is typically the minor product.\n*   Let's visualize the structures: The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is positioned on the same side as the newly formed double bond (C(Me)=C(Me)) and on the opposite side of the CH₂ bridge. This means the anhydride protons are *syn* (on the same face) to the alkene's methyl groups.\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is positioned on the same side as the CH₂ bridge and on the opposite side of the double bond. This means the anhydride protons are *anti* (on opposite faces) to the alkene's methyl groups.\n\n**4. Interpret the 2D NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals indicates spatial proximity.\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**.\n*   This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n*   Let's analyze the key proximities:\n    *   **Interaction 1: Anhydride Protons vs. Alkene Methyl Groups.**\n        *   In the **endo** (major) product, the anhydride protons are *syn* to the alkene methyl groups. They are close in space. A **strong NOE** is expected.\n        *   In the **exo** (minor) product, the anhydride protons are *anti* to the alkene methyl groups. They are far apart. **No NOE** is expected.\n    *   **Interaction 2: Anhydride Protons vs. CH₂ Bridge Protons.**\n        *   In the **endo** (major) product, the anhydride protons are *anti* to the CH₂ bridge. They are far apart. **No NOE** is expected.\n        *   In the **exo** (minor) product, the anhydride protons are *syn* to the CH₂ bridge. They are close in space. A **strong NOE** is expected.\n\n*   Since the distinguishing cross-peak is present in the major product (endo), it must be due to the interaction between the **anhydride protons** and the **alkene methyl groups**.\n\n**5. Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\n*   Now we need to match these proton groups to the signals described in the options.\n*   **Anhydride Protons:** There are two of them. Due to the molecule's symmetry, they are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent to bridgehead carbons with no protons, so they will appear as a **singlet**. Their chemical shift, being on a strained ring and alpha to two carbonyl groups, will be relatively high, around 3-4 ppm. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Alkene Methyl Groups:** There are two methyl groups on the double bond. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. This will give a **singlet** with an integral of **6H**. The chemical shift for methyl groups on a double bond is typically around 1.5-2.0 ppm. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyl Groups:** Two equivalent methyl groups on sp³ carbons. This would be a 6H singlet at a lower shift, ~1.0 ppm.\n*   **CH₂ Bridge Protons:** Two diastereotopic protons, likely giving a complex signal (or two doublets) integrating to 2H in the aliphatic region.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\n*   The NOESY cross-peak unique to the major (*endo*) product connects the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl groups.\n*   These correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   This matches option D.\n\nLet's check the other options:\n*   A) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, bridgehead Me) and 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, one bridge H). This interaction would be present in both isomers.\n*   B) 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, one bridge H) and 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm, anhydride H). This interaction is strong in the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) product.\n*   C) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, bridgehead Me) and 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm, alkene Me). This interaction would be present in both isomers.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly identifies the unique NOE cross-peak in the major product is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl C).\n    *   The single ¹H peak indicates that all protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. The shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons in an electron-deficient environment.\n    *   The two ¹³C peaks indicate two types of carbons, consistent with equivalent alkene carbons and equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n    *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by dehydrating maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has two equivalent vinylic protons and a plane of symmetry, leading to the observed simple NMR spectra.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system. It has four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at C5.\n    *   The molecular formula of the diene is C₉H₁₂.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a new six-membered ring.\n*   The product is a bicyclic adduct. The cyclopentadiene ring becomes a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   The *endo* product is usually the major product because it is formed faster (kinetically controlled). This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n    *   The *exo* product is usually the minor product.\n*   The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to the formation of the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Products**\n\n*   Let's draw the structures of the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) adducts.\n    *   The resulting bicyclic system is a derivative of bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene.\n    *   There are methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and on the double bond (C2, C3).\n    *   The anhydride ring is fused at positions C5 and C6.\n    *   There are two protons at C5 and C6, which came from the maleic anhydride.\n    *   There is a CH₂ bridge at C7.\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Major):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C2=C3 double bond.\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Minor):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C2=C3 double bond.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula Check:**\n    *   Diene (C₉H₁₂) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₄O₃).\n    *   The problem states the molecular formula is C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This suggests a subsequent reaction, likely hydrogenation of a double bond, has occurred. However, the chemical shifts provided in the options (especially 1.7 ppm for a methyl group) are characteristic of the un-hydrogenated product (C₁₃H₁₄O₃), where the methyl group is attached to a double bond (vinylic methyl). A methyl group in the hydrogenated product would appear at a much higher field (~1.0-1.2 ppm). This strong contradiction suggests the molecular formula given in the problem is a typo, and we should proceed by analyzing the structure of the direct Diels-Alder adduct, C₁₃H₁₄O₃.\n\n**4. Analyze the NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows correlations between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The question states a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the **major product** but absent (or weak) in the spectrum of the **minor product**. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *endo* adduct but not in the *exo* adduct.\n*   Let's examine the key distances in both isomers:\n    *   **In the *endo* (major) adduct:** The anhydride protons (at C5, C6) are on the same side as the C2=C3 double bond. They are spatially close to the methyl groups on this double bond (at C2, C3). They are far from the C7 bridge.\n    *   **In the *exo* (minor) adduct:** The anhydride protons (at C5, C6) are on the opposite side of the C2=C3 double bond. They are far from the vinylic methyl groups but are now close to the C7 bridge protons.\n*   Therefore, the NOE cross-peak that is strong in the major product and weak/absent in the minor product must be between the **anhydride protons (H₅, H₆)** and the **vinylic methyl groups (Me₂, Me₃)**.\n\n**5. Assign NMR Signals and Match with Options**\n\n*   Let's predict the ¹H NMR signals for the groups involved in this key NOE in the major (*endo*) product. The molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Anhydride protons (H₅, H₆):** These two protons are equivalent due to symmetry. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups and bridgehead carbons. They will appear as a **2H singlet** at a downfield shift, estimated around **~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Vinylic methyl groups (Me₂, Me₃):** These two methyl groups are attached to the double bond and are equivalent by symmetry. They will appear as a **6H singlet**. The typical shift for vinylic methyls is around **~1.7 ppm**.\n*   The NOESY cross-peak should connect these two signals. We are looking for an option that describes a correlation between a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This would be an NOE between a bridge proton (H₇) and the anhydride protons (H₅, H₆), characteristic of the *minor* (exo) product.\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: This would be an NOE between the bridgehead methyls and the vinylic methyls. This interaction is likely present in both isomers and is not the unique feature distinguishing them.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This perfectly matches our prediction for the key NOE in the major (*endo*) product between the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: This would be an NOE between a bridgehead methyl group and a bridge proton.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product arises from the unique spatial proximity of the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups in the *endo* isomer. This corresponds to a NOE between a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1.

This chemical shift is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). A single peak implies that the vinylic protons are chemically equivalent, which points to a symmetrical molecule.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows two peaks: one at 165 ppm (characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, C=O) and one at 137 ppm (characteristic of a vinylic carbon, C=C). The presence of only two signals for a molecule with at least four carbons confirms a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   The simplest and most common structure that fits all these criteria is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent (giving one ¹H signal) and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, as well as the two vinylic carbons equivalent (giving two ¹³C signals).\n\n*   **The Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring fused to the existing five-membered ring, creating a bicyclic system.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is given as C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which is consistent with the addition of the diene (C₉H₁₄) and the dienophile (C₄H₂O₃).\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the ***endo*** **adduct** and the ***exo*** **adduct**.\n*   According to the **Alder-endo rule**, the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored product, meaning it forms faster and is typically the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically more stable product but forms more slowly, making it the **minor product**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemistry and NOESY Data**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** is a 2D NMR technique that shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically less than 5 Å apart), regardless of whether they are connected by bonds.\n*   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent in the minor product. We must identify a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n\n*   **Visualizing the Adducts:**\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is positioned \"under\" the newly formed cyclohexene ring, on the same side as the C=C double bond. This places the two protons on the anhydride portion of the backbone (let's call them **H_anhydride**) in a position where they point towards the one-carbon bridge (C7) of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is positioned \"away\" from the C=C double bond. This places the **H_anhydride** protons in a position where they point towards the vinylic methyl groups on the C=C double bond and are far from the C7 bridge protons.\n\n*   **Identifying the Key NOE Interaction:**\n    *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the **H_anhydride** protons are spatially close to the protons on the C7 bridge.\n    *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the **H_anhydride** protons are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the NOE cross-peak that is unique to the major product is the one between the **H_anhydride** protons and the protons on the **C7 bridge**.\n\n**4. Assign NMR Signals and Select the Correct Answer**\n\nNow we must assign the proton signals described in the options to the protons in our structure.\n\n*   **H_anhydride:** These two protons are on carbons adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. They will be significantly deshielded. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is appropriate. Due to a plane of symmetry, they are chemically equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**.\n*   **C7 Bridge Protons:** The C7 bridge has two protons that are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments). They will appear as two separate signals, each integrating to 1H. They are coupled to each other, so they will appear as doublets. Being aliphatic protons in a strained ring, a chemical shift of **~1.5 ppm** is reasonable for one of them. This corresponds to a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n*   **Vinylic Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups on the double bond are equivalent. They will appear as a **6H singlet** at a chemical shift of **~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons are equivalent. They are more shielded and will appear as a **6H singlet** at **~1.0 ppm**.\n\nThe unique cross-peak in the major product is between the H_anhydride protons and one of the C7 bridge protons. Based on our assignments, this corresponds to the interaction between:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nThis matches option C.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the other options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls). These groups are not uniquely close in the major product.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride). This interaction is characteristic of the *minor* (*exo*) product.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 bridge proton). This is not the key differentiating feature between the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in its ¹³C spectrum.\n        *   The single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm indicates two chemically equivalent protons in the alkene region.\n        *   The two ¹³C NMR peaks correspond to two types of carbons. The peak at 137 ppm is in the range for alkene carbons (C=C), and the peak at 165 ppm is in the range for anhydride carbonyl carbons (C=O).\n        *   The high symmetry (one type of proton, two types of carbon) and the spectral data perfectly match the structure of **maleic anhydride**. The two alkene protons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent.\n\n    *   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The problem states this is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (C1=C2-C3=C4) and a CH₂ group at C5. Each of the four carbons in the diene system has a methyl group attached.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. Two stereoisomers are formed: a major and a minor product. In Diels-Alder reactions, this typically corresponds to the *endo* and *exo* products. The *endo* product is usually the major product due to favorable secondary orbital overlap in the transition state (kinetic control).\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Products:**\n    *   In the Diels-Alder reaction, the C1 and C4 of the diene react with the two carbons of the dienophile's double bond. A new six-membered ring is formed, and the CH₂ group of the cyclopentadiene becomes a one-carbon bridge (C7) in a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n    *   The resulting product is **1,4,5,6-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride**.\n        *   **Methyl groups:** Two are at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and two are on the double bond (C5, C6).\n        *   **Anhydride ring:** Fused at positions C2 and C3.\n        *   **Protons:** The two protons from the maleic anhydride are now at positions C2 and C3. The CH₂ bridge is at C7.\n\n4.  **Distinguish Between the *Endo* (Major) and *Exo* (Minor) Isomers:**\n    *   The key difference is the stereochemistry of the fused anhydride ring relative to the C5=C6 double bond within the bicyclic system.\n    *   ***Endo* Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C5=C6 double bond. It is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge.\n    *   ***Exo* Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C5=C6 double bond. It is on the same side (*syn*) of the C7 bridge.\n\n5.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectrum and Assign ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   NOESY shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   Let's assign the proton signals given in the options based on typical chemical shifts:\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (at C2 and C3). They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the C5=C6 double bond. Methyl groups on a double bond typically resonate in this region. Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). Saturated alkyl methyl groups resonate here. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is likely one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 bridge.\n\n6.  **Identify the Key NOE Correlation:**\n    *   Let's examine the spatial relationships in the two isomers:\n        *   **In the *endo* (major) product:** The anhydride ring is *syn* to the C5=C6 double bond. This brings the **H_anhydride** protons (at C2, C3) into close proximity with the **Me_alkene** groups (at C5, C6). A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n        *   **In the *exo* (minor) product:** The anhydride ring is *anti* to the C5=C6 double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far from the **Me_alkene** groups. The NOE between them would be absent or very weak. Instead, the H_anhydride protons are now close to the C7 bridge protons.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The NOE cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product must be the one between **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene**.\n    *   This corresponds to the resonances at **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)** and **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)**.\n    *   Looking at the options, this matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**1. Identification of Reactants**\n\n*   **Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm for the alkene carbons and 165 ppm for the carbonyl carbons) in its ¹³C spectrum. This spectroscopic data is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is specified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. The Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n*   This reaction is known to produce two stereoisomeric products: an *endo* and an *exo* adduct.\n*   According to the Alder endo rule, the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product, while the *exo* product is the minor, thermodynamically favored product. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed.\n\n**3. Structure and NMR of the Products**\n\n*   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework. The reaction of the symmetric diene and symmetric dienophile results in a product with a plane of symmetry.\n*   The molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃ is consistent with the addition of C₉H₁₄ (diene) and C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride).\n*   Based on the structure, we can predict the ¹H NMR signals:\n    *   **Two equivalent vinylic methyl groups:** A singlet for 6 protons, typically around 1.7 ppm.\n    *   **Two equivalent bridgehead methyl groups:** A singlet for 6 protons, in a more shielded environment, around 1.0 ppm.\n    *   **Two equivalent protons from the anhydride part:** A singlet for 2 protons, deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups, around 3.5 ppm.\n    *   **Two methylene bridge protons:** These two protons are diastereotopic (one is *syn* or \"up\" and the other is *anti* or \"down\" relative to the double bond). They are not chemically equivalent and will couple to each other, appearing as two separate doublets. Their chemical shifts are typically around 1.3-1.5 ppm.\n*   This predicted spectrum (two 6H singlets, one 2H singlet, and two 1H doublets) is consistent with the signals described in the options.\n\n**4. Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that is unique to the *endo* isomer.\n*   **In the *endo* isomer:** The anhydride ring is tucked underneath the carbon-carbon double bond of the bicycloheptene system. This geometry brings the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm).\n*   **In the *exo* isomer:** The anhydride ring is oriented away from the double bond. In this arrangement, the anhydride protons are far from the vinylic methyl groups.\n*   Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons is a definitive characteristic of the *endo* adduct and will be absent in the *exo* adduct.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\n*   The major product is the *endo* adduct.\n*   The distinguishing cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product connects the protons that are uniquely close in the *endo* geometry.\n*   This corresponds to the interaction between the **anhydride protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm)** and the **vinylic methyl groups (6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm)**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride shows a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This data is characteristic of maleic anhydride. The two equivalent alkene protons give the single ¹H peak, and the two equivalent alkene carbons (137 ppm) and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (165 ppm) give the two ¹³C peaks.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition, a [4+2] reaction between the diene and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   When a cyclic diene and a cyclic dienophile react, a bicyclic product is formed. This reaction can produce two different stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   The *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. The *exo* product is the minor, thermodynamically more stable product.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which is consistent with the addition of maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₄).\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry and Structure of Products:**\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented on the same side (*syn*) as the newly formed double bond in the six-membered ring.\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented on the opposite side (*anti*) to the double bond.\n\n4.  **2D NOESY NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) is an NMR technique that shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), even if they are not connected through chemical bonds.\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent or weak in the minor product's spectrum. This indicates a pair of protons that are spatially close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n5.  **Structural Analysis and Proton Assignment:**\n    *   Let's analyze the structure of the major (*endo*) product to identify protons that are close in space.\n        *   **Protons from Maleic Anhydride:** These two protons are attached to the carbons that were part of the dienophile's double bond. Due to the molecule's symmetry, they are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**. They are adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, so their chemical shift will be downfield, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Methyl Protons:** There are two sets of methyl groups.\n            *   **Vinyl Methyls:** Two methyl groups are attached to the carbons of the double bond. They are equivalent due to symmetry and will appear as a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift is typically in the vinylic methyl region, around **~1.7 ppm**.\n            *   **Bridgehead Methyls:** Two methyl groups are on the bridgehead carbons. They are also equivalent and will appear as another **6H singlet**. Being on saturated carbons, they will be further upfield, around **~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Spatial Proximity:**\n        *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the two anhydride protons (at ~3.5 ppm) are held underneath the C=C double bond, bringing them very close to the two vinyl methyl groups (at ~1.7 ppm). This proximity will generate a strong NOESY cross-peak.\n        *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride protons are pointing away from the C=C double bond. They are distant from the vinyl methyl groups, so no significant NOESY cross-peak would be observed between them.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The differentiating cross-peak, present in the major product and absent in the minor, connects the anhydride protons with the vinyl methyl protons. Based on the chemical shift and integration assignments:\n    *   The anhydride protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   The vinyl methyl protons are the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects these two resonances.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe search results confirm the initial reasoning.\n\n1.  **Diels-Alder Reaction and Stereochemistry**: The reaction between a cyclic diene (like a cyclopentadiene derivative) and maleic anhydride produces a bicyclic adduct. The major product is typically the *endo* isomer due to kinetic control, which involves favorable secondary orbital interactions. The *exo* isomer is the thermodynamically more stable, but minor, product.\n\n2.  **Product Structures**:\n    *   **Diene**: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This has a C5 ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, and a CH₂ group at position 5.\n    *   **Dienophile**: Maleic anhydride.\n    *   **Adduct**: The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system. The bridge is the CH₂ group (C7 in bicyclic nomenclature). The double bond is between the carbons that were C2 and C3 of the diene. The anhydride ring is fused to the other two carbons.\n    *   ***Endo* Adduct (Major Product)**: The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the CH₂ bridge.\n    *   ***Exo* Adduct (Minor Product)**: The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the CH₂ bridge.\n\n3.  **NMR Spectroscopy and NOESY**:\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals indicates spatial proximity.\n    *   The key difference between the *endo* and *exo* isomers is the spatial relationship between the anhydride protons and the bridge (CH₂) protons.\n    *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride protons are close to the *syn*-proton of the CH₂ bridge. This will result in a NOESY cross-peak.\n    *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride protons are far from the CH₂ bridge protons. This NOE interaction will be absent or very weak.\n\n4.  **Signal Assignment from the Question**:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: This chemical shift is characteristic of the protons on the anhydride ring, which are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**: This signal corresponds to one of the protons of the CH₂ bridge. The bridge protons are diastereotopic and would couple to each other (geminal coupling), appearing as doublets.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: Likely the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**: Likely the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The question states that a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent in the minor product. This uniquely identifying cross-peak must be the one connecting the protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer. This corresponds to the interaction between the anhydride protons and the bridge protons.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the signal for the anhydride protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and the signal for one of the bridge protons (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm).\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",
