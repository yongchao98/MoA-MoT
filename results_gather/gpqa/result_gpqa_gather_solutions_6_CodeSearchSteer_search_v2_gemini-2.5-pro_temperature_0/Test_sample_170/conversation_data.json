This will separate the substances into two distinct groups: those that produce a high yield of the para-isomer and those that produce a very low yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final order must have the meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) at the beginning (lowest yield) and the ortho,para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) at the end (highest yield). The correct answer must follow the pattern: `{4, 6, 2 in some order} < {1, 5, 3 in some order}`.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Group (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The -NO₂ group (4) is one of the strongest deactivating groups, leading to the lowest para-yield.\n    *   The -COOH group (6) is strongly deactivating.\n    *   The -COOC₂H₅ group (2) is slightly less deactivating than -COOH because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group on the ester oxygen slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing character.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group is sterically bulkier than the methyl group. This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chlorine atom is highly para-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its own steric hindrance, leads to a very high yield of the para-isomer (typically ~87%), which is higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nWe now combine the two ordered groups, with the meta-directors coming before the ortho,para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho,para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Underlying Principles**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of their para-monobromo derivative. Since the molar mass of all monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer is determined by the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first and most important step is to classify the substituents into two groups based on their directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This will separate the compounds into a low-yield group and a high-yield group for the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final order must have the meta-directing substances {4, 6, 2} at the beginning (lowest yield) and the ortho, para-directing substances {1, 5, 3} at the end (highest yield).\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances {4, 6, 2}**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances {1, 5, 3}**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine. Therefore, ethylbenzene will have a higher percentage yield of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is an ortho, para-director but is deactivating overall. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its own steric hindrance, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene is typically very high (around 87-89%), which is higher than that for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nNow, we combine the two ordered groups. The meta-directors have the lowest para-yields, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: 1 < 5 < 3\n*   The final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first analyze the chemical principles governing the reaction to determine the correct order of substances. Then, I will write a Python script to formalize this logic, compare the derived order with the given options, and identify the correct choice.\n\n**Analysis of the Chemical Problem:**\n\n1.  **Goal:** Arrange the substances in order of increasing yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination. Since the isomers have the same molecular weight, this is equivalent to arranging them by increasing molar percentage yield of the para-product.\n\n2.  **Classify Substituents:** The directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring is the key factor.\n    *   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These are deactivating groups that direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n        *   4) `-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n        *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n        *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n        *   1) `-CH3` (Toluene)\n        *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n        *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n    *   This means the final order must have the meta-directors {4, 6, 2} before the ortho, para-directors {1, 5, 3}.\n\n3.  **Order the Meta-Directors:** For this group, the para-yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivator is more selective for the meta position, resulting in a lower para-yield.\n    *   Deactivating strength: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n4.  **Order the Ortho, Para-Directors:** For this group, the para-yield depends on the para/ortho ratio, which is influenced by steric and electronic effects.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased bulk hinders attack at the ortho positions, making the para position more favorable. Thus, the para-yield for ethylbenzene (5) is greater than for toluene (1). Order: **1 < 5**.\n    *   **Electronic Effects:** The chlorine atom (`-Cl`) has a strong, distance-dependent inductive effect that deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This leads to a very high preference for para substitution, higher than for simple alkylbenzenes.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n5.  **Combine the Orders:** Combining the two groups gives the final sequence.\n    *   Final Order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nNow, I will use a Python script to verify this logic and match it to the given options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the correct order of substances for para-isomer yield\n    in electrophilic bromination based on chemical principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the substances and their properties for ranking.\n    # A lower 'rank' value means a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n    # The ranking is based on directing effects, deactivating strength, and steric/electronic factors.\n    substances = {\n        # Meta-directors (lowest para-yield)\n        4: {'group': '-NO2', 'type': 'm-director', 'rank': 1},  # Strongest deactivator -> lowest para-yield\n        6: {'group': '-COOH', 'type': 'm-director', 'rank': 2}, # Strong deactivator\n        2: {'group': '-COOC2H5', 'type': 'm-director', 'rank': 3}, # Weakest m-director in this group\n\n        # Ortho, para-directors (highest para-yield)\n        1: {'group': '-CH3', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'rank': 4}, # Lowest para/ortho ratio in this group\n        5: {'group': '-C2H5', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'rank': 5}, # Bulkier than -CH3, higher para-yield\n        3: {'group': '-Cl', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'rank': 6}   # Strong electronic effect favors para, highest yield\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Sort the substances based on their assigned rank.\n    sorted_substances = sorted(substances.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]['rank'])\n\n    # Step 3: Create the final ordered string from the sorted substance numbers.\n    final_order_numbers = [item[0] for item in sorted_substances]\n    final_order_string = '<'.join(map(str, final_order_numbers))\n\n    # Step 4: Define the options provided in the question.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"4<6<2<1<5<3\",\n        \"B\": \"3<5<1<6<2<4\",\n        \"C\": \"6<2<4<5<1<3\",\n        \"D\": \"4<2<6<3<1<5\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 5: Find which option matches the derived order.\n    correct_option = None\n    for option, value in options.items():\n        if value == final_order_string:\n            correct_option = option\n            break\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis based on chemical principles:\")\n    print(\"1.

Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The outcome is determined by the directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first crucial step is to classify each substituent as either an ortho,para-director or a meta-director. This divides the compounds into two distinct groups based on their expected para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These are electron-withdrawing, deactivating groups that direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis classification establishes that the final sequence must have the meta-directing substances {4, 6, 2} at the beginning (lowest yield), followed by the ortho, para-directing substances {1, 5, 3} at the end (highest yield).\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group partially counteracts the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary difference is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is deactivating but directs ortho, para. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered subgroups, we get the final arrangement from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 6: Match the Final Order with the Given Options**\nLet's compare our derived sequence with the options provided:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nThe calculated order **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3** perfectly matches option C.

Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar percentage yield. The key factor determining the yield is the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nWe must first separate the substituents into two groups: meta-directors and ortho, para-directors. This will establish the broad order, as meta-directors produce very little para-isomer, while ortho, para-directors produce a significant amount.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These are electron-withdrawing, deactivating groups that direct the incoming bromine to the meta position.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   *Conclusion:* This group {4, 6, 2} will come first in the sequence.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n    *   *Conclusion:* This group {1, 5, 3} will come last in the sequence.\n\nThe final order must follow the pattern: `{4, 6, 2 in some order} < {1, 5, 3 in some order}`.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Group {4, 6, 2}**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group slightly reduces the overall electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group {1, 5, 3}**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is highly para-directing.

This electronic factor, combined with its size, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically very high (around 87-90%), which is greater than that for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Core Chemical Principles**\n\nThe question requires arranging six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molar mass of the isomers is the same, this is equivalent to arranging them by increasing percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe key factors determining the yield are:\n1.  **Directing Effect:** Substituents are classified as either *meta-directors* or *ortho, para-directors*. Meta-directors will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer, while ortho, para-directors will produce a high yield.\n2.  **Deactivating Strength (for meta-directors):** For meta-directors, a stronger deactivating effect leads to a more selective reaction at the meta position, and thus an even *lower* yield of the para-isomer.\n3.  **Steric and Electronic Effects (for ortho, para-directors):** For ortho, para-directors, the ratio of para to ortho product determines the final para-yield. Bulkier groups increase steric hindrance at the ortho positions, favoring para substitution. Electronic effects, like the strong inductive withdrawal of halogens, can also significantly increase the para-yield.\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate the Consensus Among Candidate Answers**\n\nAll 15 candidate answers, despite some concluding with different final letters, follow the exact same logical steps and agree on the chemical reasoning.\n\n*   **Grouping:** All answers correctly separate the substances into two groups:\n    *   **Low para-yield (meta-directors):** 4 (-NO₂), 6 (-COOH), 2 (-COOC₂H₅)\n    *   **High para-yield (ortho, para-directors):** 1 (-CH₃), 5 (-C₂H₅), 3 (-Cl)\n    This establishes that the correct sequence must be of the form `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n*   **Ordering the Meta-Directors:** All answers correctly state that the order of para-yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength. They unanimously agree on the deactivating strength order: `-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅`. This leads to the consensus para-yield order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n*   **Ordering the Ortho, Para-Directors:** All answers correctly argue that the para-yield increases based on steric and electronic factors. They agree that the bulkier ethyl group gives a higher para-yield than the methyl group, and that the chloro group gives the highest para-yield due to a combination of steric and electronic effects. This leads to the consensus order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 3: Synthesize the Final Order**\n\nCombining the two unanimously agreed-upon subgroups gives a single, definitive order for the increasing yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Combined Order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n    *   (Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene)\n\n### **Step 4: Match the Derived Order to the Options**\n\nThe final step is to compare the consensus-derived order with the given options.\n\n*   **Derived Order:** `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`\n*   **Option A:** `6<2<4<5<1<3`\n*   **Option B:** `4<6<2<1<5<3`\n*   **Option C:** `3<5<1<6<2<4`\n*   **Option D:** `4<2<6<3<1<5`\n\nThe derived order **perfectly matches Option B**. The discrepancies in the candidate answers (e.g., Answer 2 concluding \"D\" or Answer 1 concluding \"C\") are simple errors in matching their correct chemical reasoning to the provided list of options. The underlying chemical analysis is sound and points unanimously to a single sequence.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first and most crucial step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This separates the compounds into two groups based on their expected yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low para-yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors (High para-yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must have the meta-directing substances {4, 6, 2} at the beginning (lowest yield) and the ortho, para-directing substances {1, 5, 3} at the end (highest yield).\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances {4, 6, 2}**\nFor these compounds, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group partially counteracts the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances {1, 5, 3}**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is deactivating but directs ortho, para. It has a strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) that deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final arrangement from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reaction and the Goal**\nThe question asks to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molar mass of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The task is therefore to rank the compounds by increasing percentage yield of the para-product.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring is the primary factor determining the product distribution. We must classify the substituents into two main categories:\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile (Br⁺) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must have the meta-directing substances {4, 6, 2} at the beginning (lowest para-yield) and the ortho, para-directing substances {1, 5, 3} at the end (highest para-yield).\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances {4, 6, 2}**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. The yield of this byproduct is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group partially counteracts the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances {1, 5, 3}**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Therefore, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is an ortho, para-director but is deactivating overall. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its own steric hindrance, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene is typically very high (around 89-90%), which is higher than that for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the meta-directors before the ortho, para-directors to get the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Principles**\nThe question asks to arrange substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molar mass of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The yield is determined by the directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nWe must first separate the substances into two groups based on their substituent's directing effect. This is the most significant factor influencing the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   *Conclusion:* These three substances will have the lowest para-yields and must come first in the final sequence.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n    *   *Conclusion:* These three substances will have the highest para-yields and must come last in the final sequence.\n\nBased on this grouping, the correct answer must have the structure: `{4, 6, 2 in some order} < {1, 5, 3 in some order}`.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Group (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is well-established: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group on the ester oxygen slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength.\n*   **Order for this group: 4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary difference is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   **Order: 1 < 5**\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is deactivating but is an ortho, para-director. It has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) that is distance-dependent, deactivating the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its own steric size, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene (around 89%) is significantly higher than that for toluene (around 67%). The steric effect of the ethyl group in (5) increases its para yield over toluene, but it is generally not enough to overcome the strong electronic preference for para-substitution in chlorobenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Underlying Principles**\nThe question asks to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination.

Therefore, the task is to rank the substances by the percentage yield of the para-product. This yield is determined by the directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first step is to classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This separates the compounds into two groups: those with high para-yield and those with very low para-yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position.

The correct order must follow the pattern: `{4, 6, 2 in some order} < {1, 5, 3 in some order}`.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para-Yield)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group partially counteracts the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para-Yield)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product.

The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (4) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (6) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (2) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group slightly reduces the overall electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances {1, 5, 3}**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product.

Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\nThe core task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction (which is proportional to the percentage yield) of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reasoning in Candidate Answers**\n\nThere is a strong consensus among all candidate answers on the underlying chemical principles. The analysis can be broken down into three main parts:\n\n*   **Part A: Classifying Substituents**\n    All answers correctly identify two groups based on the directing effects of the substituents:\n    *   **Meta-directors (Low para-yield):** These are deactivating groups that will produce very little para-product. This group includes:\n        *   4) `-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n        *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n        *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   **Ortho, Para-directors (High para-yield):** These groups will produce a significant amount of para-product. This group includes:\n        *   1) `-CH3` (Toluene)\n        *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n        *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n    This initial classification establishes that the final correct sequence must have substances {4, 6, 2} before {1, 5, 3}.\n\n*   **Part B: Ordering the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\n    All answers correctly reason that for meta-directors, the para-yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivator is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower para-yield.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is unanimously identified as: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield is the reverse: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n*   **Part C: Ordering the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)**\n    All answers correctly reason that the order within this group depends on the para-to-ortho product ratio, which is influenced by steric and electronic effects.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) in substance 5 is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`) in substance 1. This steric bulk hinders attack at the ortho positions, making the para position more favorable. Thus, the para-yield for ethylbenzene is higher than for toluene: **1 < 5**.\n    *   **Electronic Effects:** The chlorine atom (`-Cl`) in substance 3, due to its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect, deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This leads to a very high para-yield, which is experimentally known to be higher than that for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the consensus order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**3. Synthesis of the Final Order**\n\nCombining the results from Part B and Part C gives the complete sequence for increasing para-isomer yield:\n*   (Order of meta-directors) < (Order of ortho, para-directors)\n*   **(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe final, correct sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**4. Matching with the Given Options**\n\nNow, we compare this derived sequence with the provided options:\n*   A) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n*   B) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n*   C) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n*   D) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe logically derived sequence `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3` perfectly matches option **D**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reasoning presented in almost all candidate answers is sound and leads to the same conclusion. However, many of the candidates incorrectly matched their correct reasoning to the final lettered option. The correct chemical reasoning points unequivocally to the sequence `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`, which is option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Fundamental Principles**\nThe task is to arrange the six given benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of their para-monobromo product. Since the molar mass of all monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a specific starting substance is identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The yield is determined by the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first crucial step is to classify each substituent as either a meta-director or an ortho, para-director. This divides the substances into two groups with vastly different yields of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These are electron-withdrawing, deactivating groups that direct the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions, making the para-isomer a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis classification establishes that the final order must begin with the meta-directors {4, 6, 2} and end with the ortho, para-directors {1, 5, 3}.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nWithin this group, the para-yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A more strongly deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (+I effect) partially counteracts the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor this group, the para-isomer is a major product. The relative yield depends on the para-to-ortho ratio, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for substitution. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is deactivating but directs ortho, para. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its own steric size, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (around 87%) is typically higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups and Determine the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered subgroups, we get the final arrangement from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo decide the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the chemical principles is required. The goal is to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molar mass of the monobrominated products is the same regardless of the substitution position (ortho, meta, or para), the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect\n\nThe directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring is the most critical factor. We can separate the substances into two groups:\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final order must have the meta-directing substances {4, 6, 2} before the ortho, para-directing substances {1, 5, 3}.\n\n### Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Group {4, 6, 2}\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n1.  The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (-C₂H₅) partially counteracts the electron withdrawal.\n2.  Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength.\n\nThe correct order for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group {1, 5, 3}\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n1.  **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n2.  **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is deactivating but directs ortho, para. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (typically ~87%) is significantly higher than for both toluene (~62%) and ethylbenzene.\n3.  Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option A. A review of the candidate answers shows that while nearly all of them correctly perform the chemical analysis to arrive at this sequence, most fail to correctly match it to the given options. The chemical reasoning, however, is sound and consistently points to this order.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Underlying Principles**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of their para-monobromo derivative. Since the molar mass of all monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer is determined by the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first and most crucial step is to classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This separates the compounds into two distinct groups: those with a very low yield of the para-isomer and those with a high yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is only a minor byproduct.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final order must have the meta-directing substances {4, 6, 2} at the beginning (lowest yield) and the ortho, para-directing substances {1, 5, 3} at the end (highest yield).\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Consequently, ethylbenzene has a higher para-yield than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is deactivating but strongly para-directing. This is due to a combination of its size and a strong, distance-dependent inductive (-I) effect that deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. Experimental data shows that the para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene is very high (around 90%), which is typically higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete sequence for increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "To determine the final answer, a careful, step-by-step analysis of the chemical principles governing the reaction is necessary. The consensus reasoning from the candidate answers will be synthesized and verified against the provided options.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem**\n\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molecular weight of the monobrominated isomers is the same regardless of the substitution position (ortho, meta, or para), the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\n### **Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe most significant factor determining the product distribution is the directing effect of the substituent already on the ring. This allows us to separate the compounds into two distinct groups.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These are electron-withdrawing, deactivating groups that direct the incoming bromine (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct. This group includes:\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions, making the para-isomer a major product. This group includes:\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final correct sequence must have the meta-directing substances {4, 6, 2} before the ortho, para-directing substances {1, 5, 3}.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Group {4, 6, 2}**\n\nFor these substances, the para-yield is very low. The yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group {1, 5, 3}**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) in substance 5 is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`) in substance 1. This increased steric bulk hinders attack at the ortho positions, making the para position more favorable. Thus, the para-yield for ethylbenzene is higher than for toluene: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic and Steric Effects:** The chlorine atom (`-Cl`) in substance 3 is highly para-directing. This is due to a combination of its size and a strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) that deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This leads to a very high para-yield, which is experimentally known to be higher than that for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 5: Synthesize the Final Order and Match with Options**\n\nBy combining the results from the previous steps, we can construct the complete sequence for increasing para-isomer yield:\n\n*   (Order of meta-directors) < (Order of ortho, para-directors)\n*   **(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe final, logically derived sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nNow, we compare this sequence with the provided options:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe derived sequence **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3** perfectly matches option **D**. The candidate answers, while almost universally correct in their chemical reasoning, frequently failed in the final step of matching their derived sequence to the correct lettered option.\n\n<<<D>>>"

The correct answer must follow the pattern: `{4, 6, 2 in some order} < {1, 5, 3 in some order}`.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Group (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The -NO₂ group (4) is one of the strongest deactivating groups, leading to the lowest para-yield.\n    *   The -COOH group (6) is strongly deactivating.\n    *   The -COOC₂H₅ group (2) is slightly less deactivating than -COOH because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group on the ester oxygen slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing character.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group is sterically bulkier than the methyl group. This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chlorine atom is highly para-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its own steric hindrance, leads to a very high yield of the para-isomer (typically ~87%), which is higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nWe now combine the two ordered groups, with the meta-directors coming before the ortho,para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho,para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Underlying Principles**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of their para-monobromo derivative.

This will separate the compounds into a low-yield group and a high-yield group for the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.

The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances {1, 5, 3}**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine. Therefore, ethylbenzene will have a higher percentage yield of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is an ortho, para-director but is deactivating overall. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its own steric hindrance, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene is typically very high (around 87-89%), which is higher than that for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nNow, we combine the two ordered groups.

Then, I will write a Python script to formalize this logic, compare the derived order with the given options, and identify the correct choice.\n\n**Analysis of the Chemical Problem:**\n\n1.  **Goal:** Arrange the substances in order of increasing yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination. Since the isomers have the same molecular weight, this is equivalent to arranging them by increasing molar percentage yield of the para-product.\n\n2.  **Classify Substituents:** The directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring is the key factor.\n    *   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These are deactivating groups that direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n        *   4) `-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n        *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n        *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the bromine to the ortho and para positions.

A stronger deactivator is more selective for the meta position, resulting in a lower para-yield.\n    *   Deactivating strength: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n4.  **Order the Ortho, Para-Directors:** For this group, the para-yield depends on the para/ortho ratio, which is influenced by steric and electronic effects.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased bulk hinders attack at the ortho positions, making the para position more favorable. Thus, the para-yield for ethylbenzene (5) is greater than for toluene (1). Order: **1 < 5**.\n    *   **Electronic Effects:** The chlorine atom (`-Cl`) has a strong, distance-dependent inductive effect that deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This leads to a very high preference for para substitution, higher than for simple alkylbenzenes.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n5.  **Combine the Orders:** Combining the two groups gives the final sequence.\n    *   Final Order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nNow, I will use a Python script to verify this logic and match it to the given options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the correct order of substances for para-isomer yield\n    in electrophilic bromination based on chemical principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the substances and their properties for ranking.\n    # A lower 'rank' value means a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n    # The ranking is based on directing effects, deactivating strength, and steric/electronic factors.\n    substances = {\n        # Meta-directors (lowest para-yield)\n        4: {'group': '-NO2', 'type': 'm-director', 'rank': 1},  # Strongest deactivator -> lowest para-yield\n        6: {'group': '-COOH', 'type': 'm-director', 'rank': 2}, # Strong deactivator\n        2: {'group': '-COOC2H5', 'type': 'm-director', 'rank': 3}, # Weakest m-director in this group\n\n        # Ortho, para-directors (highest para-yield)\n        1: {'group': '-CH3', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'rank': 4}, # Lowest para/ortho ratio in this group\n        5: {'group': '-C2H5', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'rank': 5}, # Bulkier than -CH3, higher para-yield\n        3: {'group': '-Cl', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'rank': 6}   # Strong electronic effect favors para, highest yield\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Sort the substances based on their assigned rank.\n    sorted_substances = sorted(substances.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]['rank'])\n\n    # Step 3: Create the final ordered string from the sorted substance numbers.\n    final_order_numbers = [item[0] for item in sorted_substances]\n    final_order_string = '<'.join(map(str, final_order_numbers))\n\n    # Step 4: Define the options provided in the question.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"4<6<2<1<5<3\",\n        \"B\": \"3<5<1<6<2<4\",\n        \"C\": \"6<2<4<5<1<3\",\n        \"D\": \"4<2<6<3<1<5\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 5: Find which option matches the derived order.\n    correct_option = None\n    for option, value in options.items():\n        if value == final_order_string:\n            correct_option = option\n            break\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis based on chemical principles:\")\n    print(\"1.

Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The outcome is determined by the directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first crucial step is to classify each substituent as either an ortho,para-director or a meta-director. This divides the compounds into two distinct groups based on their expected para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These are electron-withdrawing, deactivating groups that direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis classification establishes that the final sequence must have the meta-directing substances {4, 6, 2} at the beginning (lowest yield), followed by the ortho, para-directing substances {1, 5, 3} at the end (highest yield).\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group partially counteracts the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary difference is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is deactivating but directs ortho, para. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered subgroups, we get the final arrangement from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 6: Match the Final Order with the Given Options**\nLet's compare our derived sequence with the options provided:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nThe calculated order **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3** perfectly matches option C. The analysis presented in the majority of the candidate answers is correct in its chemical reasoning, even if many failed to select the correct corresponding letter.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Principle**\nThe question asks to arrange substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction. Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar percentage yield. The key factor determining the yield is the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nWe must first separate the substituents into two groups: meta-directors and ortho, para-directors. This will establish the broad order, as meta-directors produce very little para-isomer, while ortho, para-directors produce a significant amount.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These are electron-withdrawing, deactivating groups that direct the incoming bromine to the meta position.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   *Conclusion:* This group {4, 6, 2} will come first in the sequence.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n    *   *Conclusion:* This group {1, 5, 3} will come last in the sequence.\n\nThe final order must follow the pattern: `{4, 6, 2 in some order} < {1, 5, 3 in some order}`.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Group {4, 6, 2}**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group slightly reduces the overall electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group {1, 5, 3}**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is highly para-directing. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically very high (around 87-90%), which is greater than that for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Core Chemical Principles**\n\nThe question requires arranging six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molar mass of the isomers is the same, this is equivalent to arranging them by increasing percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe key factors determining the yield are:\n1.  **Directing Effect:** Substituents are classified as either *meta-directors* or *ortho, para-directors*. Meta-directors will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer, while ortho, para-directors will produce a high yield.\n2.  **Deactivating Strength (for meta-directors):** For meta-directors, a stronger deactivating effect leads to a more selective reaction at the meta position, and thus an even *lower* yield of the para-isomer.\n3.  **Steric and Electronic Effects (for ortho, para-directors):** For ortho, para-directors, the ratio of para to ortho product determines the final para-yield. Bulkier groups increase steric hindrance at the ortho positions, favoring para substitution. Electronic effects, like the strong inductive withdrawal of halogens, can also significantly increase the para-yield.\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate the Consensus Among Candidate Answers**\n\nAll 15 candidate answers, despite some concluding with different final letters, follow the exact same logical steps and agree on the chemical reasoning.\n\n*   **Grouping:** All answers correctly separate the substances into two groups:\n    *   **Low para-yield (meta-directors):** 4 (-NO₂), 6 (-COOH), 2 (-COOC₂H₅)\n    *   **High para-yield (ortho, para-directors):** 1 (-CH₃), 5 (-C₂H₅), 3 (-Cl)\n    This establishes that the correct sequence must be of the form `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n*   **Ordering the Meta-Directors:** All answers correctly state that the order of para-yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength. They unanimously agree on the deactivating strength order: `-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅`. This leads to the consensus para-yield order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n*   **Ordering the Ortho, Para-Directors:** All answers correctly argue that the para-yield increases based on steric and electronic factors. They agree that the bulkier ethyl group gives a higher para-yield than the methyl group, and that the chloro group gives the highest para-yield due to a combination of steric and electronic effects. This leads to the consensus order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 3: Synthesize the Final Order**\n\nCombining the two unanimously agreed-upon subgroups gives a single, definitive order for the increasing yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Combined Order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n    *   (Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene)\n\n### **Step 4: Match the Derived Order to the Options**\n\nThe final step is to compare the consensus-derived order with the given options.\n\n*   **Derived Order:** `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`\n*   **Option A:** `6<2<4<5<1<3`\n*   **Option B:** `4<6<2<1<5<3`\n*   **Option C:** `3<5<1<6<2<4`\n*   **Option D:** `4<2<6<3<1<5`\n\nThe derived order **perfectly matches Option B**. The discrepancies in the candidate answers (e.g., Answer 2 concluding \"D\" or Answer 1 concluding \"C\") are simple errors in matching their correct chemical reasoning to the provided list of options. The underlying chemical analysis is sound and points unanimously to a single sequence.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first and most crucial step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This separates the compounds into two groups based on their expected yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low para-yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors (High para-yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must have the meta-directing substances {4, 6, 2} at the beginning (lowest yield) and the ortho, para-directing substances {1, 5, 3} at the end (highest yield).\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances {4, 6, 2}**\nFor these compounds, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group partially counteracts the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances {1, 5, 3}**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is deactivating but directs ortho, para. It has a strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) that deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final arrangement from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reaction and the Goal**\nThe question asks to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molar mass of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The task is therefore to rank the compounds by increasing percentage yield of the para-product.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring is the primary factor determining the product distribution. We must classify the substituents into two main categories:\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile (Br⁺) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must have the meta-directing substances {4, 6, 2} at the beginning (lowest para-yield) and the ortho, para-directing substances {1, 5, 3} at the end (highest para-yield).\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances {4, 6, 2}**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. The yield of this byproduct is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group partially counteracts the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances {1, 5, 3}**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Therefore, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is an ortho, para-director but is deactivating overall. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its own steric hindrance, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene is typically very high (around 89-90%), which is higher than that for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the meta-directors before the ortho, para-directors to get the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Principles**\nThe question asks to arrange substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molar mass of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The yield is determined by the directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nWe must first separate the substances into two groups based on their substituent's directing effect. This is the most significant factor influencing the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   *Conclusion:* These three substances will have the lowest para-yields and must come first in the final sequence.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n    *   *Conclusion:* These three substances will have the highest para-yields and must come last in the final sequence.\n\nBased on this grouping, the correct answer must have the structure: `{4, 6, 2 in some order} < {1, 5, 3 in some order}`.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Group (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is well-established: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group on the ester oxygen slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength.\n*   **Order for this group: 4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary difference is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   **Order: 1 < 5**\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is deactivating but is an ortho, para-director. It has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) that is distance-dependent, deactivating the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its own steric size, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene (around 89%) is significantly higher than that for toluene (around 67%). The steric effect of the ethyl group in (5) increases its para yield over toluene, but it is generally not enough to overcome the strong electronic preference for para-substitution in chlorobenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Underlying Principles**\nThe question asks to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molar mass of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar percentage yield. Therefore, the task is to rank the substances by the percentage yield of the para-product. This yield is determined by the directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first step is to classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This separates the compounds into two groups: those with high para-yield and those with very low para-yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final sequence must have the meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) at the beginning (lowest yield) and the ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) at the end (highest yield). The correct order must follow the pattern: `{4, 6, 2 in some order} < {1, 5, 3 in some order}`.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para-Yield)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group partially counteracts the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para-Yield)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Consequently, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is deactivating but directs ortho, para. It has a strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) that deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (typically ~87%) is higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final arrangement from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first and most crucial step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring. This determines whether the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) is directed to the meta position or the ortho and para positions. This classification separates the substances into two distinct groups based on their expected para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (Low para-yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. Consequently, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitro group)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Carboxylic acid group)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ester group)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups (High para-yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They produce a significantly higher yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Methyl group)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethyl group)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chloro group)\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final sequence must have the meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) at the beginning (lowest yield) and the ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) at the end (highest yield). The correct order must follow the pattern: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances {4, 6, 2}**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (4) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (6) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (2) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group slightly reduces the overall electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances {1, 5, 3}**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is highly para-directing. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically the highest in this group (around 87-90%).\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\nThe core task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction (which is proportional to the percentage yield) of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reasoning in Candidate Answers**\n\nThere is a strong consensus among all candidate answers on the underlying chemical principles. The analysis can be broken down into three main parts:\n\n*   **Part A: Classifying Substituents**\n    All answers correctly identify two groups based on the directing effects of the substituents:\n    *   **Meta-directors (Low para-yield):** These are deactivating groups that will produce very little para-product. This group includes:\n        *   4) `-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n        *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n        *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   **Ortho, Para-directors (High para-yield):** These groups will produce a significant amount of para-product. This group includes:\n        *   1) `-CH3` (Toluene)\n        *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n        *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n    This initial classification establishes that the final correct sequence must have substances {4, 6, 2} before {1, 5, 3}.\n\n*   **Part B: Ordering the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\n    All answers correctly reason that for meta-directors, the para-yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivator is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower para-yield.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is unanimously identified as: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield is the reverse: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n*   **Part C: Ordering the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)**\n    All answers correctly reason that the order within this group depends on the para-to-ortho product ratio, which is influenced by steric and electronic effects.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) in substance 5 is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`) in substance 1. This steric bulk hinders attack at the ortho positions, making the para position more favorable. Thus, the para-yield for ethylbenzene is higher than for toluene: **1 < 5**.\n    *   **Electronic Effects:** The chlorine atom (`-Cl`) in substance 3, due to its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect, deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This leads to a very high para-yield, which is experimentally known to be higher than that for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the consensus order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**3. Synthesis of the Final Order**\n\nCombining the results from Part B and Part C gives the complete sequence for increasing para-isomer yield:\n*   (Order of meta-directors) < (Order of ortho, para-directors)\n*   **(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe final, correct sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**4. Matching with the Given Options**\n\nNow, we compare this derived sequence with the provided options:\n*   A) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n*   B) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n*   C) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n*   D) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe logically derived sequence `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3` perfectly matches option **D**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reasoning presented in almost all candidate answers is sound and leads to the same conclusion. However, many of the candidates incorrectly matched their correct reasoning to the final lettered option. The correct chemical reasoning points unequivocally to the sequence `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`, which is option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Fundamental Principles**\nThe task is to arrange the six given benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of their para-monobromo product. Since the molar mass of all monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a specific starting substance is identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The yield is determined by the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first crucial step is to classify each substituent as either a meta-director or an ortho, para-director. This divides the substances into two groups with vastly different yields of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These are electron-withdrawing, deactivating groups that direct the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions, making the para-isomer a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis classification establishes that the final order must begin with the meta-directors {4, 6, 2} and end with the ortho, para-directors {1, 5, 3}.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nWithin this group, the para-yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A more strongly deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (+I effect) partially counteracts the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor this group, the para-isomer is a major product. The relative yield depends on the para-to-ortho ratio, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for substitution. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is deactivating but directs ortho, para. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its own steric size, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (around 87%) is typically higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups and Determine the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered subgroups, we get the final arrangement from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo decide the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the chemical principles is required. The goal is to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molar mass of the monobrominated products is the same regardless of the substitution position (ortho, meta, or para), the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect\n\nThe directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring is the most critical factor. We can separate the substances into two groups:\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final order must have the meta-directing substances {4, 6, 2} before the ortho, para-directing substances {1, 5, 3}.\n\n### Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Group {4, 6, 2}\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n1.  The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (-C₂H₅) partially counteracts the electron withdrawal.\n2.  Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength.\n\nThe correct order for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group {1, 5, 3}\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n1.  **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n2.  **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is deactivating but directs ortho, para. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (typically ~87%) is significantly higher than for both toluene (~62%) and ethylbenzene.\n3.  Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option A. A review of the candidate answers shows that while nearly all of them correctly perform the chemical analysis to arrive at this sequence, most fail to correctly match it to the given options. The chemical reasoning, however, is sound and consistently points to this order.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Underlying Principles**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of their para-monobromo derivative.

The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is deactivating but strongly para-directing. This is due to a combination of its size and a strong, distance-dependent inductive (-I) effect that deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. Experimental data shows that the para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene is very high (around 90%), which is typically higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete sequence for increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
