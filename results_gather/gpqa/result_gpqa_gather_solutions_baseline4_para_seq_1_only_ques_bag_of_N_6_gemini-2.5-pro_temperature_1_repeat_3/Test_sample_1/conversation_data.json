Its structure is C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO. The phenyl group (C₆H₅) has 6 carbons, and the propenal chain (-CH=CH-CHO) has 3 carbons, for a total of **9 carbon atoms**.\n    *   Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr): This is a Grignard reagent, which acts as a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (CH₃⁻).\n\n*   **Reaction:** Grignard reagents typically perform a 1,2-nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl carbon of aldehydes and ketones. In the case of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, 1,2-addition is strongly favored over 1,4-addition.\n    1.  The methyl group from MeMgBr attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon.\n    2.  The C=O double bond breaks, forming an alkoxide intermediate.\n    3.  A subsequent acidic workup (which is implicit in Grignard reactions) protonates the alkoxide to form a secondary alcohol.\n\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction adds one carbon atom (from the methyl group) to the cinnamaldehyde skeleton.\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH₃ (4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol)\n    *   Carbon Count: 9 (from cinnamaldehyde) + 1 (from MeMgBr) = **10 carbon atoms**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 + Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH₃, is a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Reagent:** Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is a mild oxidizing agent that selectively oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones without affecting other functional groups like carbon-carbon double bonds.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)-) is oxidized to a ketone group (-C(=O)-).\n\n*   **Product 2:** The reaction is an oxidation and does not change the number of carbon atoms.\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃ (4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one, also known as benzalacetone)\n    *   Carbon Count: **10 carbon atoms**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 + (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃, is an α,β-unsaturated ketone (an enone).\n*   **Reagent:** The complex IUPAC name \"(dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane\" refers to dimethyloxosulfonium methylide, [(CH₃)₂S(O)CH₂], also known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent. This reagent acts as a source of a methylene group (CH₂).\n\n*   **Reaction:** When reacting with α,β-unsaturated ketones, the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent performs a conjugate addition (1,4-addition or Michael addition), followed by an intramolecular ring closure to form a cyclopropane ring across the former C=C double bond.\n    1.  The nucleophilic methylene carbon of the ylide attacks the β-carbon of the enone.\n    2.  The resulting enolate intermediate cyclizes, with the α-carbon attacking the methylene carbon and displacing dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a leaving group.\n\n*   **Product 3:** The reaction adds one carbon atom (the methylene group from the ylide) to the molecule, incorporating it into a new three-membered ring.\n    *   Structure: The C=C double bond of Product 2 is replaced by a cyclopropane ring.

It is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. It contains 9 carbon atoms (6 in the phenyl ring, 3 in the propenal side chain).\n*   Methylmagnesium bromide is a Grignard reagent, which is a source of the nucleophilic methyl anion (CH3⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** Grignard reagents react with aldehydes in a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl carbon. For α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, simple Grignard reagents like MeMgBr preferentially attack the carbonyl carbon (1,2-addition) rather than the β-carbon (1,4-conjugate addition), unless a copper catalyst is present.\n*   **Mechanism:** The methyl group attacks the carbonyl carbon, and upon aqueous workup (which is implicit in a Grignard reaction), the resulting alkoxide is protonated to form a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product 1:** The aldehyde group (-CHO) is converted into a secondary alcohol with an added methyl group (-CH(OH)CH3). The structure of Product 1 is (E)-1-phenylbut-1-en-3-ol: Ph-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH3.\n*   **Carbon Count for Product 1:** One carbon atom (from the methyl group of MeMgBr) is added to the 9 carbons of cinnamaldehyde.

The reagent is (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane, which is the IUPAC name for dimethyloxosulfonium methylide, [(CH3)2S(O)CH2], also known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent.\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is an α,β-unsaturated ketone (an enone). The Corey-Chaykovsky reagent is a stabilized sulfur ylide. With enones, it preferentially undergoes a 1,4-conjugate addition (Michael addition), which leads to the formation of a cyclopropane ring.\n*   **Mechanism:** The nucleophilic methylene (-CH2-) of the ylide attacks the β-carbon of the enone. The resulting enolate intermediate then undergoes an intramolecular cyclization, displacing dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to form a cyclopropane ring across the original Cα-Cβ double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclopropane ring is formed from the α-carbon, β-carbon, and the CH2 group from the ylide. The final product is 1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Carbon Count for Product 3:** The reaction adds a CH2 group to the molecule.

The nucleophilic methyl group attacks the electrophilic carbon of the aldehyde group.\n*   **Mechanism:** The methyl group adds to the carbonyl carbon, and upon acidic workup (which is implied in Grignard reactions), the resulting alkoxide is protonated to form a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product 1:** The aldehyde group (-CHO) is converted to a secondary alcohol group with a methyl group attached (-CH(OH)CH3). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    *   Structure of Product 1: (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol, C6H5-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH3\n    *   **Carbon Count:** The original 9 carbons from cinnamaldehyde plus 1 carbon from the methylmagnesium bromide.

This is a Grignard reagent, which acts as a strong nucleophile. The nucleophilic part is the methyl carbanion (CH3⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** Grignard reagents typically perform a 1,2-addition to the carbonyl carbon of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. The methyl group attacks the electrophilic carbon of the aldehyde's carbonyl group (C=O). An aqueous or acidic workup then protonates the resulting alkoxide ion.\n*   **Product 1:** The aldehyde group (-CHO) is converted into a secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)CH3).

When it reacts with an α,β-unsaturated ketone, it undergoes a conjugate addition (1,4-addition), followed by an intramolecular ring closure. This process is known as cyclopropanation. The methylene group (-CH2-) from the ylide is added across the carbon-carbon double bond of the enone.\n*   **Product 3:** The C=C double bond of Product 2 is converted into a cyclopropane ring by the addition of the CH2 group from the ylide.

Following an aqueous workup (which is implicit in such reactions), the resulting alkoxide is protonated to form an alcohol.\n*   **Product 1:** The aldehyde group is converted into a secondary alcohol, with the methyl group added.\n    *   Structure of Product 1: Ph-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH3\n    *   Carbon count: The original 9 carbons plus one new carbon from the methyl group. 9 + 1 = **10 carbons**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** `Product 1` (Ph-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH3), which is a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Reagent:** `Pyridinium chlorochromate` (PCC). PCC is a mild oxidizing agent used to oxidize primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones. It does not affect other functional groups like the phenyl ring or the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Reaction:** The secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)-) in Product 1 is oxidized to a ketone group (-C=O).\n*   **Product 2:** The resulting molecule is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   Structure of Product 2: Ph-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3 (also known as benzylideneacetone).\n    *   Carbon count: Oxidation reactions do not change the number of carbon atoms in the substrate. So, Product 2 still has **10 carbons**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The question states, \"`3 was treated with...`\". This is most likely a typographical error, and the intended reactant is `Product 2` from the previous step, as is standard in multi-step synthesis problems. We will proceed with this logical assumption. So, the reactant is `Product 2` (Ph-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3).\n*   **Reagent:** `(dimethyl(oxo)-λ6-sulfaneylidene)methane` in DMSO. This is the systematic name for dimethylsulfoxonium methylide, ((CH3)2S(O)CH2), also known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent.\n*   **Reaction:** This sulfur ylide reacts with ketones to form epoxides (oxiranes). It adds a methylene group (CH2) across the carbonyl double bond (C=O). For α,β-unsaturated ketones like Product 2, this reagent selectively performs a 1,2-addition to the carbonyl group rather than a 1,4-addition to the double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** The ketone group in Product 2 is converted into an epoxide ring.\n    *   Structure of Product 3: The double bond and phenyl group are untouched. The C=O group becomes a three-membered ring consisting of the original carbonyl carbon, the carbonyl oxygen, and a new CH2 group from the ylide.\n    *   Carbon count: Product 2 had 10 carbons. The Corey-Chaykovsky reaction adds one carbon atom (from the CH2 group). Therefore, the number of carbons in Product 3 is 10 + 1 = **11 carbons**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFollowing the logical synthetic sequence:\n1.  trans-Cinnamaldehyde (9 C) reacts with CH3MgBr to give Product 1 (10 C).\n2.  Product 1 (10 C) is oxidized by PCC to give Product 2 (10 C).\n3.  Product 2 (10 C) reacts with the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent to give Product 3 (11 C).\n\nThe final product, Product 3, has 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and count its carbon atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** trans-cinnamaldehyde. This is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde with the structure C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO. It has a phenyl group (C₆H₅), a carbon-carbon double bond, and an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n    *   Number of carbons in trans-cinnamaldehyde = 6 (in phenyl ring) + 3 (in the propenal chain) = 9 carbons.\n\n*   **Reagent:** Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr) is a Grignard reagent. In reactions with α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, Grignard reagents typically perform a 1,2-addition, meaning the nucleophilic methyl group (CH₃) attacks the electrophilic carbon of the carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Reaction:** The attack on the carbonyl carbon followed by an aqueous workup (a standard step in Grignard reactions to protonate the intermediate alkoxide) converts the aldehyde group into a secondary alcohol. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    *   C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO + CH₃MgBr → (then H₂O) → C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃\n\n*   **Product 1:** The product is 1-phenylbut-1-en-3-ol, C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃.\n    *   A methyl group (1 carbon) has been added to the cinnamaldehyde structure (9 carbons).\n    *   Number of carbons in Product 1 = 9 + 1 = 10 carbons.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**\n\n*   **Reactant 2:** Product 1, C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃, which is a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Reagent:** Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is a mild oxidizing agent that selectively oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones.\n*   **Reaction:** The secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)-) in Product 1 is oxidized to a ketone group (-C(=O)-). This reaction does not add or remove any carbon atoms.\n    *   C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃ + PCC → C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃\n\n*   **Product 2:** The product is 4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one (also known as benzalacetone), an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   Number of carbons in Product 2 = 10 carbons.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n\n*   **Reactant 3:** Product 2, C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃. (Note: The problem statement has a typo saying \"3 was treated with...\". It is logically assumed this means \"Product 2 was treated with...\" to form Product 3).\n*   **Reagent:** (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane is the systematic IUPAC name for dimethylsulfoxonium methylide, (CH₃)₂S(=O)=CH₂. This is a stabilized sulfur ylide, commonly known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent.\n*   **Reaction:** When the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent reacts with α,β-unsaturated ketones, it undergoes a conjugate addition (or 1,4-addition) to the carbon-carbon double bond, resulting in the formation of a cyclopropane ring. The methylene group (CH₂) from the ylide is transferred to the molecule.\n    *   C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃ + (CH₃)₂S(=O)=CH₂ → 1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethanone + DMSO\n\n*   **Product 3:** The product is 1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethanone. A cyclopropane ring is formed where the C=C double bond used to be, and a CH₂ group has been added.\n    *   The carbon skeleton of Product 2 had 10 carbons. The ylide adds one carbon (as a CH₂ group).\n    *   Number of carbons in Product 3 = 10 + 1 = 11 carbons.\n\nLet's explicitly count the carbons in the final structure, 1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethanone:\n*   Phenyl group (C₆H₅-): 6 carbons\n*   Cyclopropane ring: 3 carbons\n*   Ethanone group (-C(=O)CH₃): 2 carbons\nTotal carbons = 6 (phenyl) + 3 (cyclopropane) + 2 (ethanone) = 11 carbons. However, two of the carbons are shared between the groups. A clearer way is to sum the parts:\n*   Phenyl group: 6 carbons\n*   Cyclopropyl ring atoms (not including the phenyl): 3 carbons\n*   Ketone group attached to the cyclopropane: -C(=O)CH₃. This contains 2 carbons.\nThe phenyl group is attached to one of the cyclopropane carbons, and the ketone group is attached to another.\nTotal Carbons = (Phenyl carbons) + (Cyclopropane carbons) + (Carbons in the keto-methyl group) = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 carbons. Wait, the ketone group is -C(=O)CH3. It is attached to the ring. The ring has a carbon, say C1, attached to the ketone. The ketone consists of C=O and CH3. So this is 2 carbons. Another ring carbon C2 is attached to phenyl group (6C). So we have C2-Ph, C1-C(=O)CH3. And a third ring carbon C3 (which is a CH2).\nSo, C(phenyl, 6C) + C(ring carbon attached to phenyl) + C(ring carbon attached to ketone) + C(ring carbon from ylide) + C(carbonyl) + C(methyl).\nThat's 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11 carbons.\n\nFinal summary of carbon count:\n*   trans-cinnamaldehyde: 9 carbons\n*   After adding CH₃ (Grignard): 9 + 1 = 10 carbons (Product 1 & 2)\n*   After adding CH₂ (ylide): 10 + 1 = 11 carbons (Product 3)\n\nThe final product, Product 3, has 11 carbon atoms. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and its carbon count.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide**\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (Starting material):** *trans*-cinnamaldehyde. This is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. Its structure consists of a benzene ring (C₆H₅) attached to a *trans*-propenal group (-CH=CH-CHO).\n    *   Let's count the carbons in *trans*-cinnamaldehyde:\n        *   Benzene ring: 6 carbon atoms\n        *   Vinyl group (-CH=CH-): 2 carbon atoms\n        *   Aldehyde group (-CHO): 1 carbon atom\n        *   **Total carbons in cinnamaldehyde = 6 + 2 + 1 = 9 carbons.**\n\n*   **Reactant 2:** Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr). This is a Grignard reagent, which acts as a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (CH₃⁻).\n\n*   **Reaction:** Grignard reagents perform a 1,2-addition to the carbonyl carbon of aldehydes and ketones. The methyl group attacks the electrophilic carbon of the aldehyde group (C=O), and after an aqueous workup (which is implied), the oxygen is protonated to form an alcohol.\n\n*   **Product 1:** The aldehyde group is converted into a secondary alcohol with a methyl group attached.\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH₃ ((E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol)\n    *   **Carbon count of Product 1:** We started with 9 carbons and added one methyl group from the Grignard reagent. So, 9 + 1 = **10 carbon atoms**.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment of Product 1 with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** Product 1 (C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH₃). This is a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Reactant 2:** Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC). PCC is a mild oxidizing agent that selectively oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones. It does not affect other functional groups like alkenes (C=C) or benzene rings.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)-) in Product 1 is oxidized to a ketone group (-C(=O)-).\n\n*   **Product 2:** The resulting molecule is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃ ((E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one, also known as benzalacetone)\n    *   **Carbon count of Product 2:** This reaction is an oxidation; no carbon atoms are added or removed. Therefore, the carbon count remains the same as in Product 1. **10 carbon atoms**.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment of Product 2 with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** Product 2 (C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃).

This is the systematic IUPAC name for dimethyloxosulfonium methylide, [(CH₃)₂S(O)CH₂], commonly known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent. This reagent acts as a source for a methylene group (a CH₂ unit).\n\n*   **Reaction:** The Corey-Chaykovsky reagent reacts with α,β-unsaturated ketones. As a \"soft\" nucleophile, it preferentially undergoes 1,4-conjugate addition (Michael addition) across the carbon-carbon double bond, rather than 1,2-addition to the carbonyl group. This reaction results in the formation of a cyclopropane ring.\n\n*   **Product 3:** The methylene group from the ylide adds across the C=C double bond of Product 2, forming a three-membered cyclopropane ring. The acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃) and the phenyl group (C₆H₅) remain attached to the newly formed ring.\n    *   Structure: A phenyl group and an acetyl group attached to adjacent carbons of a cyclopropane ring (1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethan-1-one).\n    *   **Carbon count of Product 3:** We start with Product 2, which has 10 carbons. The Corey-Chaykovsky reagent adds one carbon atom (from the CH₂ group) to form the cyclopropane ring. Therefore, the total number of carbons in Product 3 is 10 + 1 = **11 carbon atoms**.\n\n**Summary of Carbon Count:**\n*   **Cinnamaldehyde:** 9 C\n*   **Product 1:** 9 + 1 = 10 C\n*   **Product 2:** 10 C\n*   **Product 3:** 10 + 1 = 11 C\n\nThe final product, Product 3, has 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the number of carbon atoms in the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Synthesis and Carbon Counting\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide**\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (starting material):** *trans*-cinnamaldehyde.\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO.\n    *   It consists of a phenyl group (C₆H₅), a vinyl group (-CH=CH-), and an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n    *   Let's count the carbon atoms: 6 in the phenyl ring + 2 in the vinyl group + 1 in the aldehyde group = **9 carbon atoms**.\n*   **Reactant 2:** Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr), a Grignard reagent.\n    *   This reagent adds a methyl group (CH₃), which contains **1 carbon atom**.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Grignard reaction.

The vinyl aldehyde part has 3 carbon atoms (-CH=CH-C=O). Thus, trans-cinnamaldehyde has a total of 6 + 3 = 9 carbon atoms.\n*   **Reaction 1:** The starting material is treated with methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr), a Grignard reagent. In a Grignard reaction with an aldehyde, the nucleophilic alkyl group (in this case, methyl, CH₃) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon. This reaction adds the methyl group to the molecule's carbon skeleton.\n*   **Carbon Count of Product 1:** The reaction adds one carbon atom (from the methyl group) to the 9 carbons of cinnamaldehyde.

It is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. It contains 9 carbon atoms (6 in the phenyl ring, 3 in the propenal side chain).\n*   Methylmagnesium bromide is a Grignard reagent, which is a source of the nucleophilic methyl anion (CH3⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** Grignard reagents react with aldehydes in a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl carbon. For α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, simple Grignard reagents like MeMgBr preferentially attack the carbonyl carbon (1,2-addition) rather than the β-carbon (1,4-conjugate addition), unless a copper catalyst is present.\n*   **Mechanism:** The methyl group attacks the carbonyl carbon, and upon aqueous workup (which is implicit in a Grignard reaction), the resulting alkoxide is protonated to form a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product 1:** The aldehyde group (-CHO) is converted into a secondary alcohol with an added methyl group (-CH(OH)CH3). The structure of Product 1 is (E)-1-phenylbut-1-en-3-ol: Ph-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH3.\n*   **Carbon Count for Product 1:** One carbon atom (from the methyl group of MeMgBr) is added to the 9 carbons of cinnamaldehyde.

The Corey-Chaykovsky reagent is a stabilized sulfur ylide. With enones, it preferentially undergoes a 1,4-conjugate addition (Michael addition), which leads to the formation of a cyclopropane ring.\n*   **Mechanism:** The nucleophilic methylene (-CH2-) of the ylide attacks the β-carbon of the enone. The resulting enolate intermediate then undergoes an intramolecular cyclization, displacing dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to form a cyclopropane ring across the original Cα-Cβ double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclopropane ring is formed from the α-carbon, β-carbon, and the CH2 group from the ylide. The final product is 1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Carbon Count for Product 3:** The reaction adds a CH2 group to the molecule.

Its structure is a benzene ring attached to a propenal group (C6H5-CH=CH-CHO). It is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. It has 9 carbon atoms (6 in the benzene ring, 2 in the C=C double bond, and 1 in the aldehyde group).\n*   **Reactant 2:** Methylmagnesium bromide (CH3MgBr). This is a Grignard reagent, which acts as a strong nucleophile. The nucleophilic part is the methyl carbanion (CH3⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** Grignard reagents typically perform a 1,2-addition to the carbonyl carbon of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. The methyl group attacks the electrophilic carbon of the aldehyde's carbonyl group (C=O). An aqueous or acidic workup then protonates the resulting alkoxide ion.\n*   **Product 1:** The aldehyde group (-CHO) is converted into a secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)CH3). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    *   The structure of Product 1 is (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol: C6H5-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH3.\n*   **Carbon Count for Product 1:** The starting cinnamaldehyde had 9 carbon atoms. One methyl group (1 carbon) was added from the Grignard reagent. So, Product 1 has 9 + 1 = 10 carbon atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** Product 1, (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol, which is a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Reactant 2:** Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC). This is a mild oxidizing agent that specifically oxidizes primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones. It does not affect other functional groups like carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Reaction:** The secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)-) in Product 1 is oxidized to a ketone group (-C(=O)-).\n*   **Product 2:** The resulting molecule is (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one, also known as benzylideneacetone. Its structure is C6H5-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3.\n*   **Carbon Count for Product 2:** This oxidation reaction does not add or remove any carbon atoms. Therefore, Product 2 still has 10 carbon atoms.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** Product 2, (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one, which is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Reactant 2:** (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane. This is the IUPAC name for dimethylsulfoxonium methylide, `(CH3)2S(=O)=CH2`, also known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent.\n*   **Reaction:** This reagent is a sulfur ylide. When it reacts with an α,β-unsaturated ketone, it undergoes a conjugate addition (1,4-addition), followed by an intramolecular ring closure. This process is known as cyclopropanation. The methylene group (-CH2-) from the ylide is added across the carbon-carbon double bond of the enone.\n*   **Product 3:** The C=C double bond of Product 2 is converted into a cyclopropane ring by the addition of the CH2 group from the ylide. The resulting structure is (2-phenylcyclopropyl)(methyl)ketone.\n*   **Carbon Count for Product 3:** Product 2 had 10 carbon atoms. The Corey-Chaykovsky reaction adds one methylene group (-CH2-), which contains one carbon atom. Therefore, the final product, Product 3, has 10 + 1 = 11 carbon atoms.\n\nLet's summarize the carbon count through the synthesis:\n*   trans-cinnamaldehyde: 9 C\n*   Product 1 (after Grignard reaction): 9 C + 1 C = 10 C\n*   Product 2 (after oxidation): 10 C\n*   Product 3 (after cyclopropanation): 10 C + 1 C = 11 C\n\nThe final product contains 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and count its carbon atoms.\n\n**Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde treated with methylmagnesium bromide**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** *trans*-cinnamaldehyde (C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO).

It is not strong enough to affect the carbon-carbon double bond or the phenyl ring.\n*   **Product 2:** The secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)-) is oxidized to a ketone group (-C(=O)-). The structure of Product 2 is *trans*-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one (C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃).\n*   **Carbon Count of Product 2:** Oxidation does not change the number of carbon atoms.

This is a stabilized sulfur ylide, commonly known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent.\n*   **Reaction:** When an α,β-unsaturated ketone reacts with a stabilized sulfur ylide like the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent, a conjugate addition (or Michael addition) occurs. The ylide adds its methylene group (-CH₂-) across the carbon-carbon double bond to form a cyclopropane ring.\n*   **Product 3:** The C=C double bond in Product 2 is converted into a cyclopropane ring. The final structure is 1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Carbon Count of Product 3:** We started with Product 2, which has 10 carbons.

However, two of the carbons are shared between the groups. A clearer way is to sum the parts:\n*   Phenyl group: 6 carbons\n*   Cyclopropyl ring atoms (not including the phenyl): 3 carbons\n*   Ketone group attached to the cyclopropane: -C(=O)CH₃. This contains 2 carbons.\nThe phenyl group is attached to one of the cyclopropane carbons, and the ketone group is attached to another.\nTotal Carbons = (Phenyl carbons) + (Cyclopropane carbons) + (Carbons in the keto-methyl group) = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 carbons. Wait, the ketone group is -C(=O)CH3. It is attached to the ring. The ring has a carbon, say C1, attached to the ketone. The ketone consists of C=O and CH3. So this is 2 carbons. Another ring carbon C2 is attached to phenyl group (6C). So we have C2-Ph, C1-C(=O)CH3. And a third ring carbon C3 (which is a CH2).\nSo, C(phenyl, 6C) + C(ring carbon attached to phenyl) + C(ring carbon attached to ketone) + C(ring carbon from ylide) + C(carbonyl) + C(methyl).\nThat's 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11 carbons.\n\nFinal summary of carbon count:\n*   trans-cinnamaldehyde: 9 carbons\n*   After adding CH₃ (Grignard): 9 + 1 = 10 carbons (Product 1 & 2)\n*   After adding CH₂ (ylide): 10 + 1 = 11 carbons (Product 3)\n\nThe final product, Product 3, has 11 carbon atoms.

This is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. Its structure consists of a benzene ring (C₆H₅) attached to a *trans*-propenal group (-CH=CH-CHO).\n    *   Let's count the carbons in *trans*-cinnamaldehyde:\n        *   Benzene ring: 6 carbon atoms\n        *   Vinyl group (-CH=CH-): 2 carbon atoms\n        *   Aldehyde group (-CHO): 1 carbon atom\n        *   **Total carbons in cinnamaldehyde = 6 + 2 + 1 = 9 carbons.**\n\n*   **Reactant 2:** Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr). This is a Grignard reagent, which acts as a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (CH₃⁻).\n\n*   **Reaction:** Grignard reagents perform a 1,2-addition to the carbonyl carbon of aldehydes and ketones. The methyl group attacks the electrophilic carbon of the aldehyde group (C=O), and after an aqueous workup (which is implied), the oxygen is protonated to form an alcohol.\n\n*   **Product 1:** The aldehyde group is converted into a secondary alcohol with a methyl group attached.\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH₃ ((E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol)\n    *   **Carbon count of Product 1:** We started with 9 carbons and added one methyl group from the Grignard reagent.

It does not affect other functional groups like alkenes (C=C) or benzene rings.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)-) in Product 1 is oxidized to a ketone group (-C(=O)-).\n\n*   **Product 2:** The resulting molecule is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃ ((E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one, also known as benzalacetone)\n    *   **Carbon count of Product 2:** This reaction is an oxidation; no carbon atoms are added or removed. Therefore, the carbon count remains the same as in Product 1. **10 carbon atoms**.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment of Product 2 with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** Product 2 (C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃).

This reagent acts as a source for a methylene group (a CH₂ unit).\n\n*   **Reaction:** The Corey-Chaykovsky reagent reacts with α,β-unsaturated ketones. As a \"soft\" nucleophile, it preferentially undergoes 1,4-conjugate addition (Michael addition) across the carbon-carbon double bond, rather than 1,2-addition to the carbonyl group. This reaction results in the formation of a cyclopropane ring.\n\n*   **Product 3:** The methylene group from the ylide adds across the C=C double bond of Product 2, forming a three-membered cyclopropane ring. The acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃) and the phenyl group (C₆H₅) remain attached to the newly formed ring.\n    *   Structure: A phenyl group and an acetyl group attached to adjacent carbons of a cyclopropane ring (1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethan-1-one).\n    *   **Carbon count of Product 3:** We start with Product 2, which has 10 carbons. The Corey-Chaykovsky reagent adds one carbon atom (from the CH₂ group) to form the cyclopropane ring. Therefore, the total number of carbons in Product 3 is 10 + 1 = **11 carbon atoms**.\n\n**Summary of Carbon Count:**\n*   **Cinnamaldehyde:** 9 C\n*   **Product 1:** 9 + 1 = 10 C\n*   **Product 2:** 10 C\n*   **Product 3:** 10 + 1 = 11 C\n\nThe final product, Product 3, has 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the number of carbon atoms in the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Synthesis and Carbon Counting\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide**\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (starting material):** *trans*-cinnamaldehyde.\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO.\n    *   It consists of a phenyl group (C₆H₅), a vinyl group (-CH=CH-), and an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n    *   Let's count the carbon atoms: 6 in the phenyl ring + 2 in the vinyl group + 1 in the aldehyde group = **9 carbon atoms**.\n*   **Reactant 2:** Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr), a Grignard reagent.\n    *   This reagent adds a methyl group (CH₃), which contains **1 carbon atom**.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Grignard reaction.

This type of reaction changes a functional group but does not add or remove carbon atoms from the skeleton.\n*   **Product 2 (4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one):**\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃\n    *   Carbon count = **10 carbons** (unchanged from Product 1).\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n\n*   **Reactant: Product 2** (an α,β-unsaturated ketone)\n    *   Carbon count: **10 carbons**.\n*   **Reagent: (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n    *   This is the IUPAC name for dimethyloxosulfonium methylide, [(CH₃)₂S(O)CH₂], also known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent. This reagent acts as a source for a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   Carbon count of the transferred group: **1 carbon**.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Corey-Chaykovsky reaction. With α,β-unsaturated ketones, this reagent performs a conjugate addition to the carbon-carbon double bond, followed by an intramolecular ring-closure to form a cyclopropane ring. Essentially, it adds a CH₂ group to form a three-membered ring across the former double bond.\n*   **Product 3 (2-acetyl-1-phenylcyclopropane):**\n    *   A new cyclopropane ring is formed. One carbon atom from the reagent has been added to the molecule.\n    *   Carbon count = 10 (from Product 2) + 1 (from the methylene group) = **11 carbons**.\n\nTherefore, the final product, Product 3, has a total of 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of carbon atoms in Product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide**\n\n*   **Reactant:** *trans*-cinnamaldehyde. Its structure is a phenyl group (C₆H₅) attached to a propenal group (-CH=CH-CHO).\n    *   Phenyl group: 6 carbons\n    *   Propenal group: 3 carbons\n    *   Total carbons in *trans*-cinnamaldehyde = 6 + 3 = 9 carbons.\n    *   The chemical formula is C₉H₈O.\n\n*   **Reagent:** Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr), a Grignard reagent. The nucleophilic part is the methyl group (CH₃⁻).\n\n*   **Reaction:** Grignard reagents react with aldehydes via nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl carbon. This is a 1,2-addition. The methyl group attacks the carbon of the C=O group. After an aqueous workup (which is implied in Grignard reactions to obtain a neutral alcohol product), the carbonyl oxygen is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n*   **Product 1:** The aldehyde group (-CHO) is converted into a secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)CH₃).\n    *   Structure of Product 1: C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃ (4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol).\n    *   **Carbon count for Product 1:** We started with 9 carbons and added one carbon from the methyl group. So, Product 1 has 9 + 1 = 10 carbon atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃, which is a secondary alcohol.\n\n*   **Reagent:** Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is a mild oxidizing agent. It oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones without affecting other functional groups like carbon-carbon double bonds.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)CH₃) is oxidized to a ketone group (-C(=O)CH₃).\n\n*   **Product 2:** The structure is C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃ ((E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one, also known as benzalacetone). This is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   **Carbon count for Product 2:** This oxidation reaction does not add or remove any carbon atoms. Therefore, Product 2 still has 10 carbon atoms.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃. (Note: The problem statement has a typo \"3 was treated with...\". It is assumed to mean \"Product 2 was treated with...\").\n\n*   **Reagent:** (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane is the IUPAC name for dimethyloxosulfonium methylide, [(CH₃)₂S(O)CH₂]. This is a stabilized sulfur ylide, also known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent.\n\n*   **Reaction:** When reacting with α,β-unsaturated ketones, this stabilized ylide undergoes conjugate addition (1,4- or Michael addition). The nucleophilic methylene group (⁻CH₂) from the ylide attacks the β-carbon of the C=C double bond. This is followed by an intramolecular ring-closing step that displaces dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and forms a cyclopropane ring in place of the C=C double bond.\n\n*   **Product 3:** The C=C double bond of Product 2 is converted into a cyclopropane ring. The net result is the addition of one methylene (-CH₂) group to the molecule.\n    *   Structure of Product 3: 1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Carbon count for Product 3:** We started with Product 2, which has 10 carbons. The reaction adds one carbon atom from the ylide's methylene group. Therefore, Product 3 has 10 + 1 = 11 carbon atoms.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe number of carbon atoms in each step is as follows:\n*   trans-cinnamaldehyde: 9 carbons\n*   Product 1: 9 + 1 = 10 carbons\n*   Product 2: 10 carbons (no change)\n*   Product 3: 10 + 1 = 11 carbons\n\nThe final product, Product 3, has 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of carbon atoms in product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide**\n\n*   **Reactant:** *trans*-cinnamaldehyde.\n    *   The structure is a benzene ring (C6H5) attached to a propenal group (-CH=CH-CHO).\n    *   Its chemical formula is C9H8O.\n    *   Let's count the carbon atoms: 6 in the benzene ring + 3 in the -CH=CH-CHO chain = **9 carbon atoms**.\n*   **Reagent:** Methylmagnesium bromide (CH3MgBr).\n    *   This is a Grignard reagent, which is a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (CH3-).\n    *   This reagent adds one carbon atom to the substrate.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic addition of the Grignard reagent to the carbonyl group of the aldehyde.
