This is a statement about the number density of stars with respect to parallax. In mathematical terms, if N is the number of stars, this relationship describes how the number of stars dN in a small parallax interval d(plx) changes. We can write this as a proportionality:\n    dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵\n    or\n    dN ∝ plx⁻⁵ d(plx)\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). This corresponds to the quantity dN/dr. We need to find the proportionality of dN/dr as a function of r.\n\n3.  **Establish the Fundamental Relationship between Distance and Parallax:**\n    The parallax of a star (plx) is inversely proportional to its distance (r). The standard definition is:\n    plx = 1/r\n    This also means that:\n    r = 1/plx\n\n4.  **Relate the Differentials:**\n    To convert the expression from being in terms of parallax to being in terms of distance, we need to find the relationship between the small interval d(plx) and the small interval dr. We can do this by taking the derivative of the parallax-distance relation.\n    plx = r⁻¹\n    Differentiating plx with respect to r gives:\n    d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n    Rearranging this gives:\n    d(plx) = (-1/r²) dr\n    When considering the number of stars in an interval, we are interested in the magnitude of the interval, not its sign. The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (r) increases, parallax (plx) decreases. So, we can use the magnitude:\n    |d(plx)| = (1/r²) dr\n\n5.  **Perform the Substitution:**\n    Now we substitute the expressions for plx and d(plx) in terms of r into our original proportionality.\n    Original proportionality: dN ∝ plx⁻⁵ d(plx)\n    Substitute plx = 1/r:\n    dN ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵ d(plx)\n    dN ∝ r⁵ d(plx)\n    Now substitute d(plx) = (1/r²) dr:\n    dN ∝ r⁵ * (1/r²) dr\n    dN ∝ r⁵⁻² dr\n    dN ∝ r³ dr\n\n6.  **Find the Final Proportionality:**\n    The expression dN ∝ r³ dr tells us how the number of stars (dN) in a small distance shell (dr) depends on the distance (r). The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of distance, which is dN/dr. From our derived expression, we can see:\n    dN/dr ∝ r³\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance varies as the cube of the distance (r³). Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) ~ r⁵\n    B) ~ r⁴\n    C) ~ r²\n    D) ~ r³\n\n    Our result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the variables and relationships:**\n    *   `N`: The number of stars.\n    *   `plx`: The parallax of a star.\n    *   `r`: The distance to a star.\n    *   The fundamental relationship between parallax and distance is `plx = 1/r`.\n\n2.  **State the given information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This is the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*, which can be written as a derivative:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` or `dN/d(plx) = k * plx^-5` where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n\n3.  **Identify the goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically the number of stars *per unit range of distance*. This is the derivative `dN/dr`.\n\n4.  **Use the chain rule to change variables:**\n    To find `dN/dr` from `dN/d(plx)`, we can use the chain rule of calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the necessary derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We know `plx = 1/r = r^-1`. Differentiating `plx` with respect to `r` gives:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r^-1) = -1 * r^-2 = -1/r^2`\n\n6.  **Substitute the known parts into the chain rule equation:**\n    Substitute the expressions for `dN/d(plx)` and `d(plx)/dr` into the chain rule formula:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx^-5) * (-1/r^2)`\n\n7.  **Express everything in terms of distance `r`:**\n    Now, replace `plx` with `1/r` in the expression:\n    `plx^-5 = (1/r)^-5 = r^5`\n\n8.  **Complete the substitution and simplify:**\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (-1/r^2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r^3`\n\n9.  **Interpret the result:**\n    The negative sign indicates that the number density decreases as distance increases, which is physically expected. The question asks for the proportionality, which is how the magnitude changes. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^3`.\n\n    `dN/dr ~ r^3`\n\n10. **Compare with the options:**\n    The result `~ r^3` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars (`N`) per unit range of parallax (`plx`) varies as `1/plx^5`. This can be written mathematically as a proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of distance (`r`) changes with distance. In other words, we need to find the proportionality for `dN/dr` in terms of `r`.\n\n3.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    The parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. The standard astronomical definition is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Derivatives:**\n    To convert the derivative with respect to parallax (`d/d(plx)`) to a derivative with respect to distance (`d/dr`), we use the chain rule:\n    `dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * d(plx)/dr`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We need to differentiate the relationship `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`.\n    `plx = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    Since the number of stars in a given range must be a positive quantity, we are interested in the magnitude of this relationship. So, we can consider `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`.\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    Now, substitute the known proportionalities and the derivative back into the chain rule equation:\n    `dN/dr ∝ dN/d(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance (`r`):**\n    The current expression has both `plx` and `r`. We need to replace `plx` with its equivalent in `r` using the relationship `plx = 1/r`.\n    `plx⁻⁵ = (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n\n8.  **Final Proportionality:**\n    Substitute this back into the expression for `dN/dr`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²) `\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance changes as `r³`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars (N) varies with parallax (plx) in a specific way. The number of stars per unit parallax, which can be written as the derivative dN/d(plx), is proportional to 1/plx⁵.\n    Mathematically, this is:\n    dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵  or  dN/d(plx) = k * plx⁻⁵ (where k is a constant of proportionality).\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance (r), specifically the number of stars per unit range of distance. This quantity is the derivative dN/dr. We are looking for the functional relationship between dN/dr and r.\n\n3.  **Relate Distance and Parallax:**\n    The parallax of a star is defined as the inverse of its distance. The standard formula is:\n    plx = 1/r\n    This also means r = 1/plx.\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Derivatives:**\n    We want to find dN/dr, and we know dN/d(plx). We can relate these two derivatives using the chain rule:\n    dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Missing Piece (d(plx)/dr):**\n    We need to find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance. Using the relationship from step 3:\n    plx = 1/r = r⁻¹\n    Taking the derivative with respect to r:\n    d(plx)/dr = d/dr (r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    Now we can substitute the known parts into the chain rule equation from step 4.\n    *   From step 1: dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵\n    *   From step 5: d(plx)/dr = -1/r²\n\n    So,\n    dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (-1/r²)\n\n7.  **Express the Result in Terms of Distance (r):**\n    The current expression has both plx and r. To get the final relationship, we need to express everything in terms of r. We use the relationship plx = 1/r from step 3.\n    Substitute plx = 1/r into the expression:\n    dN/dr ∝ ((1/r)⁻⁵) * (-1/r²)\n    dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²)\n    dN/dr ∝ -r⁽⁵⁻²⁾\n    dN/dr ∝ -r³\n\n8.  **Final Interpretation:**\n    The result shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance (dN/dr) is proportional to r³. The negative sign indicates that as one variable increases, the other formally decreases in the mathematical setup, but the question is about the functional dependence or the magnitude of the change. Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance range varies as r³.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ r^5\nB) ~ r^2\nC) ~ r^3\nD) ~ r^4\n\nThe calculated relationship matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given how the number of stars (N) varies with parallax (plx): N ~ 1/plx^5.\n    *   We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of distance (dN/dr) varies with distance (r).\n\n2.  **Interpret the Given Information:**\n    The statement \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\" refers to the number of stars found within a small interval of parallax, dp. This is a differential distribution, which we can write as:\n    dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx^5\n\n    *Why is this the correct interpretation?* In astronomy, when discussing star counts as a function of a parameter like magnitude or parallax, it's common to refer to the number density or distribution function (i.e., the number of stars per unit interval of that parameter). A cumulative count would typically be specified more explicitly, for example, \"the total number of stars with parallax greater than plx\". For a uniform star distribution, it is a known result that dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx^4. The problem presents a similar, but slightly different, power law.\n\n3.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The question asks \"How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?\". This is asking for the quantity dN/dr.\n\n4.  **Relate the Variables:**\n    We need to find a relationship between dN/dr and dN/d(plx). We can do this using the chain rule from calculus:\n    dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)\n\n5.  **Find the Necessary Derivative:**\n    We need to find the derivative of parallax (plx) with respect to distance (r). The fundamental relationship between parallax and distance is:\n    plx = 1/r = r⁻¹\n\n    Now, we differentiate plx with respect to r:\n    d(plx)/dr = d/dr (r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n\n6.  **Combine the Pieces:**\n    Now substitute the given information and the derivative we just calculated into the chain rule equation:\n    dN/dr ~ (1/plx^5) * (-1/r²)\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance (r):**\n    The current expression has both `plx` and `r`. To find the final relationship with `r`, we must replace `plx` with its equivalent in terms of `r` (plx = 1/r):\n    dN/dr ~ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (-1/r²)\n    dN/dr ~ (r^5) * (-1/r²)\n    dN/dr ~ -r^(5-2)\n    dN/dr ~ -r³\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The result shows that the number of stars per unit distance, dN/dr, is proportional to r³. The negative sign is a result of the inverse relationship between parallax and distance and can be ignored when considering only the proportionality of the magnitudes.\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance varies as r³.\n\n    This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given the relationship between the number of stars and parallax. Specifically, the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* varies as 1/plx⁵. Let's write this mathematically. Let N be the number of stars and plx be the parallax. The number of stars per unit range of parallax is represented by the derivative dN/d(plx).\n    *   So, the given information is: dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find how the number of stars *per unit range of distance* (r) changes with distance. This is represented by the derivative dN/dr.\n    *   Our goal is to find the proportionality of dN/dr with respect to r.\n\n3.  **Find the Key Relationship:**\n    *   The crucial link between the given information and the goal is the relationship between distance (r) and parallax (plx).\n    *   By definition, parallax is inversely proportional to distance: plx = 1/r.\n\n4.  **Use Calculus to Transform the Variables:**\n    *   We have a function in terms of `plx` (dN/d(plx)) and we want to express it in terms of `r` (dN/dr). The chain rule of differentiation is the perfect tool for this.\n    *   The chain rule states: dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Necessary Components:**\n    *   **First part (given):** We already know dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵.\n    *   **Second part (derivative):** We need to find the derivative of plx with respect to r.\n        *   plx = 1/r = r⁻¹\n        *   d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    *   Now, substitute the two parts back into the chain rule equation:\n        dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (-1/r²)\n    *   The expression is still in terms of both `plx` and `r`.

The question asks for the relationship of the *magnitude*, which is how it \"changes\". Therefore, we are interested in the power of r.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of distance, dN/dr, is proportional to r³.\n\n8.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) ~ r³\n    *   B) ~ r⁴\n    *   C) ~ r²\n    *   D) ~ r⁵\n    *   Our result, r³, matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement**\n    *   We are given an observational relationship in a specific region of the sky.\n    *   The relationship is between the \"number of stars\" and \"parallax (plx)\".\n    *   The relationship is given as: Number of stars ∝ 1/plx⁵.\n    *   We need to find how the \"number of stars per unit range of distance (r)\" changes with distance.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Given Relationship**\n    *   The phrase \"the number of stars varies with parallax\" can be ambiguous.

The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) is a physical density, which must be a positive quantity. The negative sign arises because as distance `r` increases, parallax `plx` decreases (their differentials `dr` and `d(plx)` have opposite signs).\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the relationship is what matters.

The given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5.\n    *   We need to determine how the number of stars per unit distance, dN/dr, changes with distance, r.\n\n2.  **Interpret the phrase \"number of stars varies with...\":**\n    In astronomy, statements about number counts (e.g., \"number of stars/galaxies\") as a function of an observable quantity (like magnitude, flux, or parallax) often refer to the **cumulative number** of objects. For example, \"the number of stars brighter than magnitude m\" or \"the number of galaxies with flux greater than S\".\n    *   Parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance (r): plx = 1/r.\n    *   A larger parallax means a smaller distance, and a smaller parallax means a larger distance.\n    *   It is standard to count stars *out to* a certain distance r, which we denote as N(<r). This corresponds to counting stars with a parallax *greater than* a certain value plx = 1/r, which we can denote as N(>plx).\n    *   Therefore, the most plausible interpretation of the statement \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\" is that it describes the cumulative number of stars with parallax greater than plx.\n    *   So, we have: N(>plx) ∝ 1/plx^5.\n\n3.  **Translate the Relationship from Parallax to Distance:**\n    *   We want to express the cumulative number of stars as a function of distance, r.\n    *   The cumulative number of stars within a distance r is N(<r).\n    *   Since r = 1/plx, a star being within distance r is equivalent to its parallax being greater than plx.

The term \"number of stars\" in this context typically refers to the cumulative number of stars observed with a parallax greater than a certain value, which corresponds to stars being closer than a certain distance.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position due to the Earth's orbit. It is inversely proportional to the star's distance (`r`). For standard units (parallax in arcseconds, distance in parsecs), the relationship is:\n    `plx = 1 / r`\n    Or, in terms of proportionality:\n    `plx ∝ 1 / r`\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars in Terms of Distance:**\n    Now, we can substitute the relationship between parallax and distance into the given formula for the number of stars.\n    Since `N ∝ 1 / plx^5` and `plx ∝ 1 / r`, we have:\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)`\n    `N ∝ r^5`\n    This tells us that the cumulative number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`. We can write this as an equation `N = k * r^5`, where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance, r\". This quantity is the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which is mathematically represented by the derivative `dN/dr`.\n    We need to differentiate our expression for `N` with respect to `r`:\n    `N = k * r^5`\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n    Using the power rule for differentiation (`d/dx (x^n) = n * x^(n-1)`), we get:\n    `dN/dr = k * 5 * r^(5-1)`\n    `dN/dr = (5k) * r^4`\n\n5.  **Find the Final Proportionality:**\n    Since `5k` is just another constant, the relationship simplifies to:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance varies as the fourth power of the distance.

For a star at distance `r`, its parallax `plx` is given by:\n    `plx = 1 / r`\n\n    This means that a larger parallax corresponds to a smaller distance, and vice-versa. Therefore, the cumulative number of stars with parallax `≥ plx` is the same as the cumulative number of stars with distance `≤ r`.\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars in Terms of Distance:** We can substitute the distance relationship into the given star count formula.

This quantity `n(r)` is mathematically represented as `dN/dr`.\n\n2.  **Establish the Fundamental Relationship between Distance and Parallax:**\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to distance (`r`). The standard formula is `plx = 1/r` (when `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n\n3.  **Interpret the Given Relation `N ∝ 1/plx^5`:**\n    *   In astronomy, when we talk about star counts as a function of a limiting property (like magnitude or parallax), we usually refer to the cumulative number of objects within that limit.\n    *   So, \"the number of stars varies with parallax\" is best interpreted as the cumulative number of stars with a parallax *greater than* a certain value `plx`. A larger parallax means a smaller distance.\n    *   Therefore, `N(>plx)` represents the total number of stars from the observer out to a distance `r = 1/plx`. Let's denote this cumulative number of stars within distance `r` as `N_c(r)`.\n    *   So, the given relation is `N(>plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n\n4.  **Translate the Relation from Parallax to Distance:**\n    *   We want to express the cumulative number of stars as a function of distance `r`, i.e., find `N_c(r)`.\n    *   We know `N_c(r) = N(>plx)` where `r = 1/plx`.\n    *   Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the given proportionality:\n        `N_c(r) ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`\n        `N_c(r) ∝ r⁵`\n    *   This tells us that the total number of stars observed out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r⁵`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for the number of stars *per unit range of distance*. This is the rate of change of the cumulative number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative `dN_c/dr`.\n    *   We have the proportionality `N_c(r) = k * r⁵` for some constant `k`.\n    *   Now, we differentiate `N_c(r)` with respect to `r`:\n        `dN_c/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵)`\n        `dN_c/dr = 5 * k * r⁴`\n    *   This shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r⁴`.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) varies as `r⁴`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`. This means the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, which we can denote as `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `plx⁻⁵`.\n    Mathematically:\n    `dN / d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n    where `dN` is the number of stars in an infinitesimally small parallax range `d(plx)`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance `r`. This means we need to find the number of stars per unit interval of distance, which is `dN/dr`. We want to see how `dN/dr` is related to `r`.\n\n3.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    The fundamental relationship between astronomical distance (`r`) and parallax (`plx`) is that they are inversely proportional. For small angles (which is always the case for stellar parallax), the formula is:\n    `r = 1 / plx` or equivalently `plx = 1 / r`\n    (This assumes `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n\n4.  **Perform a Change of Variables:**\n    We have a relationship in terms of `plx` and we want to convert it to a relationship in terms of `r`. We can use the chain rule from calculus:\n    `dN / dr = (dN / d(plx)) * (d(plx) / dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We start with the relationship `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`. We can differentiate this with respect to `r`:\n    `d(plx) / dr = d(r⁻¹) / dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1 / r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Chain Rule Equation:**\n    Now we substitute the proportionalities and the derivative back into our chain rule formula:\n    `dN / dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (-1 / r²)`\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of `r`:**\n    Our expression for `dN/dr` currently contains both `plx` and `r`. To get the final relationship, we need to replace `plx` with its equivalent in terms of `r` (`plx = 1/r`).\n    `dN / dr ∝ ((1/r)⁻⁵) * (-1 / r²)`\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    Now, we simplify the mathematical expression:\n    `(1/r)⁻⁵ = (r⁻¹)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n    So, the proportionality becomes:\n    `dN / dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1 / r²)`\n    `dN / dr ∝ -r⁽⁵⁻²⁾`\n    `dN / dr ∝ -r³`\n\n9.  **Interpret the Final Result:**\n    The result `dN/dr ∝ -r³` tells us how the number density changes with distance. The negative sign arises because distance (`r`) and parallax (`plx`) are inversely related (as `r` increases, `plx` decreases). The physical quantity, the number of stars per unit distance, must be positive. Therefore, we are interested in the magnitude of this relationship.\n\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r³`.\n\n    `N(r) ~ r³`\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`. In astrophysics and physics, when a quantity \"varies with\" a variable, it typically refers to the density or distribution function. So, we interpret the given information as the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    We can write this as a proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, `r`, per unit range of distance. This is asking for the functional form of `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Find the Relationship between Parallax and Distance:**\n    Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance to the star (when distance is measured in parsecs and parallax in arcseconds). The relationship is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Derivatives:**\n    To find `dN/dr` from `dN/d(plx)`, we can use the chain rule of calculus. However, since the number of stars `dN` in a corresponding interval of parallax `d(plx)` and distance `dr` must be positive, it's safest to use the formula for transforming probability distributions, which involves the absolute value of the Jacobian (the derivative of the transformation).\n    The formula is:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We need to differentiate the relationship `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`.\n    `plx = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    The absolute value is:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute the Pieces into the Transformation Formula:**\n    Now we substitute the expressions for `dN/d(plx)` and `|d(plx)/dr|` into our formula from step 4.\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²) `\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of `r`:**\n    The current expression has both `plx` and `r`. To get the final answer in terms of `r` only, we substitute `plx = 1/r` into the expression.\n    `dN/dr ∝ ( (1/r)⁻⁵ ) * (1/r²) `\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    Using the rules of exponents (`(a/b)⁻ⁿ = (b/a)ⁿ` and `aⁿ * aᵐ = aⁿ⁺ᵐ`):\n    `(1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n    So, the expression becomes:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁵ * (1/r²) `\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁵ * r⁻² `\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁵⁻² `\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³ `\n\nConclusion: The number of stars per unit range of distance varies as `r³`. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nThe problem asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance range and the distance itself. Let's break down the given information and relationships.\n\n1.  **Given Relationship:**\n    The number of stars, let's denote it by `N`, is observed to vary with parallax (`plx`) according to the relation:\n    N ∝ 1 / plx⁵\n\n    This relationship typically refers to the *cumulative* number of stars with a parallax greater than a certain value `plx`. A larger parallax corresponds to a closer star, so this is equivalent to the total number of stars observed within a certain distance. Let's call this cumulative number `N_cum`.\n\n2.  **Parallax and Distance:**\n    Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`) to the star. The relationship is:\n    plx ∝ 1/r\n    For simplicity in our proportionality calculations, we can write `plx = c/r`, where `c` is a constant. We can even set `c=1` without loss of generality for determining the final proportionality.\n    plx = 1/r\n\n3.  **Express Cumulative Number of Stars in terms of Distance:**\n    We can substitute the parallax-distance relationship into the given number-count relation.\n    N_cum ∝ 1 / plx⁵\n    N_cum ∝ 1 / (1/r)⁵\n    N_cum ∝ 1 / (1/r⁵)\n    N_cum ∝ r⁵\n\n    This tells us that the total number of stars counted out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r⁵`.\n    We can write this as `N_cum(r) = k * r⁵` for some constant `k`.\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    The question asks for \"how the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\". This is the number density of stars in a spherical shell at distance `r`. Mathematically, this corresponds to the rate of change of the cumulative number with respect to distance, which is the derivative `dN_cum/dr`.\n\n    Let's differentiate `N_cum(r)` with respect to `r`:\n    `dN_cum/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵)`\n\n    Using the power rule for differentiation (`d/dx (x^n) = n*x^(n-1)`):\n    `dN_cum/dr = k * 5 * r^(5-1)`\n    `dN_cum/dr = 5k * r⁴`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN_cum/dr`) is proportional to `r⁴`.\n\n    `dN_cum/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\n    Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) ~ r³\n    B) ~ r⁴\n    C) ~ r²\n    D) ~ r⁵\n\n    The correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars, let's call it `N`, varies with parallax, `plx`, according to the relation:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n    In stellar astronomy, when we talk about the \"number of stars with a certain parallax\", we are typically referring to the cumulative number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* a certain value `plx`. This is because a larger parallax means the star is closer. So, `N(>plx)` represents the total number of stars from our position out to a certain distance limit.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax to Distance:**\n    The parallax (`plx`) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance (`r`). The fundamental relationship is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    where `r` is the distance in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds.\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, so we must first express `N` in terms of `r`. We can do this by substituting the parallax-distance relation into the given formula.\n\n    A parallax value greater than `plx` (`>plx`) corresponds to a distance less than `r` (`<r`). Therefore, the number of stars within a distance `r` is given by `N(<r)`.\n\n    Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the given relation:\n    `N(<r) ∝ 1/(1/r)^5`\n    `N(<r) ∝ 1/(1/r^5)`\n    `N(<r) ∝ r^5`\n\n    This means the cumulative number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`. We can write this as `N(r) = k * r^5`, where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance, r\". This quantity is the rate of change of the cumulative number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative `dN/dr`. This represents the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance `r`.\n\n    We differentiate the expression for `N(r)` with respect to `r`:\n    `N(r) = k * r^5`\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n\n    Using the power rule for differentiation (`d/dx(ax^n) = n*a*x^(n-1)`):\n    `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^(5-1)`\n    `dN/dr = 5k * r^4`\n\n5.  **State the Final Proportionality:**\n    Since `5k` is just another constant, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of distance is directly proportional to `r^4`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    This result matches option B.\n\n    A) ~ r^5 (This is the cumulative number of stars, not the number per unit distance)\n    B) ~ r^4 (This is the number of stars per unit distance)\n    C) ~ r^2 (This would be true if the star density in space were uniform)\n    D) ~ r^3\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nThe number of stars `N` varies with parallax `plx`.

They are inversely proportional:\n`plx = k/r`, where `k` is a constant.\n\nTo relate the two distributions (`dN/d(plx)` and `dN/dr`), we use the chain rule for derivatives:\n`dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * d(plx)/dr`\n\nSince the number of stars per unit distance must be a positive quantity, we consider the absolute value of the derivative:\n`dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\nLet's find the term `|d(plx)/dr|`.\nGiven `plx = k/r = k * r^(-1)`, we differentiate with respect to `r`:\n`d(plx)/dr = -k * r^(-2) = -k/r^2`\nThe absolute value is:\n`|d(plx)/dr| = k/r^2 ∝ 1/r^2`\n\nNow we substitute this and the given relation for `dN/d(plx)` into our chain rule equation:\n`dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r^2)`\n\nThe final step is to express everything in terms of `r`. We use the relation `plx ∝ 1/r`.

Understanding the Relationship between Number of Stars and Parallax**\n\nThe problem states that the number of stars, `N`, varies with parallax, `plx`, as `1/plx^5`. In astronomical contexts, this typically refers to the cumulative number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* a certain value `plx`. Let's denote this as `N(≥plx)`.\n\nSo, the given relationship is:\n`N(≥plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\nwhere `∝` means \"is proportional to\".\n\n**2. Relating Parallax to Distance**\n\nParallax is the apparent shift in the position of a nearby star against the background of distant stars as the Earth orbits the Sun. It is inversely proportional to the star's distance, `r`. The standard formula is:\n\n`plx = 1/r`\n\nwhere `r` is the distance in parsecs and `plx` is the parallax in arcseconds.\n\nA larger parallax corresponds to a smaller distance, and a smaller parallax corresponds to a larger distance. Therefore, the condition of having a parallax greater than or equal to `plx` (`p ≥ plx`) is equivalent to having a distance less than or equal to `r` (`d ≤ r`), where `r = 1/plx`.\n\n**3. Expressing the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance**\n\nWe can now rephrase the given information in terms of distance. `N(≤r)`, the number of stars within a distance `r` from the observer, is proportional to:\n\n`N(≤r) = N(≥plx)` where `plx = 1/r`.\n\nSubstitute `plx = 1/r` into the original proportionality:\n\n`N(≤r) ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n`N(≤r) ∝ 1 / (r⁻⁵)`\n`N(≤r) ∝ r⁵`\n\nThis means the total (cumulative) number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.\n\n**4. Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Distance**\n\nThe question asks \"How does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?\". This is asking for the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance. Mathematically, this is the derivative of the cumulative number of stars `N(r)` with respect to `r`, which is `dN/dr`. This quantity represents the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance `r`.\n\nWe have the proportionality `N(r) ∝ r⁵`. Let's write this as an equation with a constant of proportionality, `k`:\n\n`N(r) = k * r⁵`\n\nNow, we differentiate `N(r)` with respect to `r`:\n\n`dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵)`\n`dN/dr = 5 * k * r⁴`\n\nFrom this result, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, is proportional to `r⁴`:\n\n`dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe number of stars per unit range of distance varies as the fourth power of the distance.

In stellar astronomy, this typically refers to the number of stars found within a small interval of parallax, `d(plx)`. This can be written as a proportionality for the differential number count:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance (`r`) per unit range of distance. This corresponds to the quantity `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Find the Relationship between `dN/dr` and `dN/d(plx)`:**\n    To convert a derivative with respect to parallax into a derivative with respect to distance, we use the chain rule from calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n4.  **Establish the Relationship between Distance and Parallax:**\n    Parallax is defined as the reciprocal of the distance to the star (when distance is measured in parsecs and parallax in arcseconds).\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We need to differentiate the expression for parallax with respect to distance:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d(1/r)/dr = -1/r^2`\n    For proportionality, we are concerned with the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases).\n    `|d(plx)/dr| ∝ 1/r^2`\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Chain Rule Equation:**\n    Now we can substitute the known proportionalities into the chain rule equation from step 3:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r^2)`\n\n7.  **Express the Final Relationship in Terms of `r`:**\n    The final step is to replace the parallax term (`plx`) with its equivalent in terms of distance (`r = 1/plx`):\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (1/r^2)`\n    Simplify the expression:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r^2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^3`\n\nThus, the number of stars per unit range of distance changes in proportion to the cube of the distance.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given a relationship between the number of stars and their parallax (`plx`). Let's denote the number of stars as `N`. The relationship is given as varying like `1/plx^5`.\n    *   We are asked to find how the number of stars changes with distance (`r`). Specifically, it asks for the number of stars \"per unit range of distance,\" which means we need to find the functional form of the density `dN/dr`.\n    *   We need the fundamental relationship between distance (`r`) and parallax (`plx`).\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The standard formula is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    where `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds. For our purposes, the proportionality `plx ∝ 1/r` is what matters.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Given Variation:**\n    The phrase \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\" can be interpreted in two main ways:\n    a) As a *density function*: The number of stars in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` is proportional to `plx⁻⁵ d(plx)`. In calculus terms, this means `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n    b) As a *cumulative function*: The total number of stars with parallax *greater than* `plx` is proportional to `plx⁻⁵`.\n\n    In physics and mathematics, when a quantity \"varies with\" a variable, it usually refers to the function or density itself, not its integral (cumulative value). For example, \"velocity varies with time as `t²`\" means `v(t) ∝ t²`, not `∫v(t)dt ∝ t²`. Therefore, interpretation (a) is the more standard and direct reading of the statement. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\n4.  **Set up the Mathematical Transformation:**\n    Our goal is to find the relationship for `dN/dr` starting from the relationship for `dN/d(plx)`. We can do this using the chain rule for derivatives, which is essentially a change of variables for the density function.\n\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   From the problem statement (as interpreted above), we have:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n    *   We need to find the derivative of `plx` with respect to `r`:\n        `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`\n        `d(plx)/dr = d(r⁻¹)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n    *   Now, substitute these into the chain rule equation. We are interested in proportionality, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just signifies that as one variable increases, the other decreases).\n        `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²) `\n\n    *   The expression for `dN/dr` should only depend on `r`. So, we substitute `plx = 1/r` into the expression:\n        `plx⁻⁵ = (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n\n    *   Putting it all together:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²) `\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) varies as the cube of the distance (`r³`). This corresponds to option B.\n\n*(Self-Correction/Verification): If we had used the cumulative interpretation, we would get `N(<r) ∝ r⁵`, and then `dN/dr ∝ d(r⁵)/dr ∝ r⁴`, which is option C. However, the interpretation of \"varies with\" as a density is more direct. Furthermore, assuming the given relation `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵` is a density, we can integrate it to find the cumulative count: `N(>plx) = ∫(k/p⁵)dp = -k/(4p⁴)`. This means the cumulative count varies as `plx⁻⁴`. This leads to a cumulative count versus distance `N(<r) ∝ r⁴`, and differentiating this with respect to `r` gives the density `dN/dr ∝ r³`. This cross-check confirms the consistency of the density interpretation and the final result.*\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n    *   **Given:** The number of stars as a function of parallax (`plx`) is proportional to `1/plx^5`.

Understand the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance (`dN/dr`) and distance (`r`), given a relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) and parallax (`plx`).\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information:**\nThe number of stars varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This means the number of stars in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` is proportional to `1/plx^5`.

The number of stars `dN` in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` must be the same as the number of stars in the corresponding distance interval `dr`.\n    `dN = (dN/dr) * dr`\n    `dN = (dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)`\n\n    Therefore:\n    `(dN/dr) * dr = (dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)`\n\n    Rearranging to solve for our target `dN/dr`, we get:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n    We use the absolute value because the number of stars must be positive, while the derivative `d(plx)/dr` is negative (as distance `r` increases, parallax `plx` decreases).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Derivative:**\n    We need to find the derivative of `plx` with respect to `r`:\n    `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    The absolute value is:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n5.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    Now we substitute the known parts back into our chain rule equation:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * (1/r²)`\n\n    We also need to express `dN/d(plx)` in terms of `r`.

In astronomical contexts, \"number of stars\" typically refers to the cumulative number of stars observed that are brighter or closer than a certain limit. In this case, it means the number of stars with a parallax greater than a given value `plx`. A larger parallax corresponds to a closer star. So, we can write this relationship as:\n    `N(>plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n    Here, `N(>plx)` is the total number of stars with parallax greater than the value `plx`.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax to Distance:** Parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are inversely proportional. The relationship is given by:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    This means a star at distance `r` has a parallax of `1/r`. Consequently, all stars with a parallax greater than `plx` are located within the distance `r = 1/plx`.\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:** We can now rewrite the relationship from step 1 in terms of distance `r`. The number of stars within a distance `r`, denoted as `N(<r)`, is the same as the number of stars with a parallax greater than `1/r`.\n    Substituting `plx = 1/r` into the proportionality:\n    `N(<r) ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`\n    `N(<r) ∝ r⁵`\n    This tells us that the cumulative number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r⁵`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:** The question asks how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance\". This is the star number density with respect to distance, which can be found by taking the derivative of the cumulative number `N(<r)` with respect to the distance `r`.\n    Let `N(<r) = C * r⁵`, where `C` is a constant of proportionality.\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (C * r⁵)`\n    `dN/dr = 5 * C * r⁴`\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r⁴`.\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of distance varies as `r⁴`.

It is inversely proportional to the distance (r) to the star.\n    The mathematical relationship is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    This also means that distance can be expressed as:\n    `r = 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Define the given information.**\n    The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax, `plx`, as `1/plx^5`. This means the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, which we can write as a differential `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    So, `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n\n3.  **State the goal.**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. In other words, we need to find the proportionality for `dN/dr`.\n\n4.  **Relate the differentials `dN/d(plx)` and `dN/dr`.**\n    We can use the chain rule from calculus to relate the two derivatives:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the term `d(plx)/dr`.**\n    Since we know `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`, we can differentiate `plx` with respect to `r`:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n6.  **Express `dN/d(plx)` in terms of `r`.**\n    We are given `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`. Since `plx = 1/r`, it follows that `1/plx = r`.\n    Substituting this into the proportionality gives:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ (r)^5 = r^5`\n\n7.  **Combine the pieces to find `dN/dr`.**\n    Now substitute the expressions from steps 5 and 6 into the chain rule equation from step 4:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (-1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r³`\n\n8.  **Interpret the result.**\n    The number of stars in a given range of distance (`dN`) must be a positive quantity for an increasing distance interval (`dr`). The negative sign arises from the inverse relationship between distance and parallax (as `r` increases, `plx` decreases). When considering the distribution or density of stars, we are interested in the magnitude of this relationship. We can think of transforming the infinitesimal element `d(plx)` to `dr`.

For simplicity, we can write:\n        `plx = 1/r`\n\n3.  **Execute the Calculation**\n    We need to find the two terms on the right side of the chain rule equation and then multiply them.\n\n    *   **First term: `dN/d(plx)` in terms of `r`**\n        We are given `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n        Substitute `plx = 1/r` into this expression:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n\n    *   **Second term: `d(plx)/dr`**\n        We need to differentiate the parallax-distance relation with respect to `r`:\n        `plx = r⁻¹`\n        `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n    *   **Combine using the Chain Rule**\n        Now substitute these two results back into the chain rule formula:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²) `\n\n        For proportionality, we can ignore the negative sign (it just indicates that dN and dr have opposite signs in this formulation, which isn't relevant for the scaling relationship).\n        `dN/dr ∝ r⁵ * r⁻²`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) is proportional to the cube of the distance (`r³`).\n\n5.  **Match with Options**\n    Comparing our result with the given choices:\n    A) ~ r³\n    B) ~ r²\n    C) ~ r⁵\n    D) ~ r⁴\n\n    Our result `~ r³` matches option A.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\nLet's think about a standard case. For a uniform distribution of stars in 3D space, the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr at distance r is `dN ∝ r² dr`, so `dN/dr ∝ r²`. Let's see what parallax dependence this implies. `dN/d(plx) = dN/dr * dr/d(plx)`. Since `r=1/plx`, `dr/d(plx) = -1/plx²`. So, `dN/d(plx) ∝ (r²) * (-1/plx²) = (1/plx²) * (-1/plx²) ∝ plx⁻⁴`. So, `dN/dr ∝ r²` corresponds to `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁴`.\nIn our problem, `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`, which is a faster drop-off. This implies a non-uniform density. Following the same logic as the main derivation: `dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * d(plx)/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (-r⁻²) ∝ ((1/r)⁻⁵) * (-r⁻²) ∝ r⁵ * r⁻² ∝ r³`.

Let's denote the number of stars as `N` and parallax as `p`.

For instance, `N(m)` is the number of stars brighter than magnitude `m`.\n    *   Analogously, \"the number of stars varies with parallax `p`\" is best interpreted as the cumulative number of stars with a parallax greater than `p`. A parallax greater than `p` corresponds to a distance less than `r = 1/p`.\n    *   So, let `N(<r)` be the total number of stars within a distance `r`. Let `N_cum(p)` be the number of stars with parallax greater than `p`. The given statement means `N_cum(p) ∝ 1/p^5`.\n\n3.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    *   Parallax (`p`) and distance (`r`) are fundamentally related by the equation `p = 1/r` (where `r` is in parsecs and `p` is in arcseconds). We can use this to switch between the two variables.\n\n4.  **Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:**\n    *   The number of stars within distance `r`, `N(<r)`, is the same as the number of stars with parallax greater than `p = 1/r`.\n    *   Therefore, we can write: `N(<r) = N_cum(p) = N_cum(1/r)`.\n    *   Using the given relationship `N_cum(p) ∝ 1/p^5`, we can substitute `p = 1/r`:\n        `N(<r) ∝ 1/(1/r)^5`\n    *   Simplifying the expression gives:\n        `N(<r) ∝ r^5`\n    *   This tells us that the cumulative number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance, r\".

Understanding the Given Information\n\nThe problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵\".\nLet's denote the number of stars as `N` and the parallax as `plx`. The relationship can be written as a proportionality:\nN ∝ 1 / plx⁵ or N ∝ plx⁻⁵\n\nIn astrophysics, when discussing star counts as a function of a limiting parameter (like magnitude, distance, or parallax), \"the number of stars\" typically refers to the **cumulative count** of all stars satisfying the condition. In this case, it means the number of stars with a parallax *greater than* a certain value `plx` (which corresponds to stars *closer than* a certain distance `r`).\n\n### 2. Relating Parallax to Distance\n\nParallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are inversely related. The standard formula is:\nr = 1 / plx\n(where `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n\nFrom this relationship, we can express parallax in terms of distance:\nplx = 1 / r\n\n### 3.

Determining the Quantity to be Found\n\nThe question asks for \"how the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\". This is asking for the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance. Mathematically, this is the derivative of the number of stars `N` with respect to the distance `r`, which is `dN/dr`.\n\nThis quantity, `dN/dr`, represents the number of stars within a thin spherical shell at distance `r` with a unit thickness.\n\n### 5.

This is because surveys can detect all stars down to a certain faintness, which corresponds to being within a certain distance `r` (or having a parallax greater than a certain `plx`).\n    *   So, `N` represents the total number of stars with parallax larger than `plx`, which is equivalent to the total number of stars within a distance `r = 1/plx`.\n    *   Let's rewrite the given relationship using `r`.\n    *   We have `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   Substitute `plx ∝ 1/r` into the expression:\n    *   `N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    *   `N ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)`\n    *   `N ∝ r^5`\n    *   This equation tells us that the *cumulative* number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`. Let's write this as `N(r) = C * r^5`, where C is a constant of proportionality.\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for \"how the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\".

This describes a distribution, specifically the number of stars found within a small range of parallax. We can write this as a proportionality for the number of stars per unit parallax, `dN/d(plx)`:\n    \n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` or `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n2.  **Identify the target quantity:** The question asks how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance, r\". This is the number of stars per unit distance, `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Relate the variables:** The two variables are parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`). In astronomy, for small angles, they are inversely related:\n\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    or equivalently,\n    `r = 1/plx`\n\n4.  **Find the relationship between the differentials:** We need to find how `dN/dr` relates to `dN/d(plx)`. We can use the chain rule from calculus:\n\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the derivative `d(plx)/dr`:** We need to differentiate the relationship `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`:\n\n    `plx = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n6.  **Apply the transformation:** When converting a number distribution from one variable to another, we are interested in the magnitude of the change, not the direction (the negative sign simply means that as distance `r` increases, parallax `plx` decreases). Therefore, we use the absolute value of the derivative, which is often called the Jacobian of the transformation:\n\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = |-1/r²| = 1/r²`\n\n    So the relationship between the distributions is:\n\n    `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n7.  **Substitute the known proportionalities:** Now, we substitute the expressions we have into this relationship:\n\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n    *   `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n    This gives:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n8.  **Express everything in terms of `r`:** The final step is to replace `plx` with its equivalent in terms of `r` (`plx = 1/r`) to get the final answer:\n\n    `dN/dr ∝ ( (1/r)⁻⁵ ) * (1/r²)`\n\n    Recall that `(1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`.

We can write this as:\n    `n(plx) ∝ 1 / plx^5`\n\n3.  **Identify the Necessary Relationship:** We need to connect the number of stars per unit distance (`n(r)`) to the number of stars per unit parallax (`n(plx)`). The number of stars in a small element must be the same whether we describe that element by its distance `r` or its parallax `plx`.\n    Let's consider a small number of stars `dN`. This can be expressed as:\n    `dN = n(r) dr`  (Number of stars in a distance shell of thickness `dr`)\n    `dN = n(plx) d(plx)` (Number of stars in a parallax interval of width `d(plx)`)\n\n    Since the number of stars `dN` is an inherently positive quantity, and as distance `r` increases, parallax `plx` decreases (so `dr` and `d(plx)` have opposite signs), we should use absolute values when equating them:\n    `n(r) |dr| = n(plx) |d(plx)|`\n\n4.  **Relate the variables:** To connect these two expressions, we need the relationship between distance (`r`) and parallax (`plx`). They are inversely proportional.\n    `plx = k / r`\n    where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n\n5.  **Formulate a Plan:** We want to find `n(r)`. We can rearrange the equation from step 3:\n    `n(r) = n(plx) * |d(plx) / dr|`\n    This means we need to perform two main tasks:\n    a) Express the term `n(plx)` in terms of `r`.\n    b) Find the derivative `|d(plx) / dr|` and express it in terms of `r`.\n    c) Combine the results.\n\n6.  **Execute the Plan:**\n\n    *   **Part a: Find `|d(plx) / dr|`**\n        We start with the relationship `plx = k / r`. Now we differentiate `plx` with respect to `r`:\n        `d(plx) / dr = d/dr (k * r⁻¹) = -k * r⁻² = -k / r²`\n        Taking the absolute value, we get:\n        `|d(plx) / dr| = k / r²`\n        So, the proportionality is:\n        `|d(plx) / dr| ∝ 1 / r²`\n\n    *   **Part b: Express `n(plx)` in terms of `r` (This part can be done within the final substitution).**\n\n    *   **Part c: Combine everything.**\n        Let's take our central equation:\n        `n(r) = n(plx) * |d(plx) / dr|`\n        Now, substitute the proportionalities we have:\n        `n(r) ∝ (1 / plx⁵) * (1 / r²)`\n        The expression is still mixed with `plx` and `r`. We need to replace `plx` with its `r` equivalent. From `plx ∝ 1/r`, we have `1/plx ∝ r`. Therefore:\n        `1 / plx⁵ = (1/plx)⁵ ∝ r⁵`\n        Now substitute this back into the expression for `n(r)`:\n        `n(r) ∝ (r⁵) * (1 / r²)`\n\n7.  **Simplify and Finalize:**\n    `n(r) ∝ r⁵ / r² = r^(5-2)`\n    `n(r) ∝ r³`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of distance (`n(r)`) changes with distance `r` as `r³`.

The key physical principle is that parallax is the inverse of distance (`plx = 1/r`).\n\nThere are two primary, and equally valid from a logical standpoint, interpretations of the initial information \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵\":\n\n1.  **Density Function Interpretation:** The phrase is interpreted to mean the number of stars per unit parallax interval (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx⁵`. This is a common interpretation in a general physics or calculus context.\n    *   The derivation proceeds using the chain rule: `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`.\n    *   With `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵` and `|d(plx)/dr| ∝ 1/r²`, this correctly yields:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵ * (1/r²) = r⁵ * r⁻² = r³`.\n\n2.  **Cumulative Function Interpretation:** The phrase is interpreted to mean the cumulative number of stars with parallax greater than a certain value (`N(>plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx⁵`. This is a common convention in observational astronomy for star counts.\n    *   The derivation proceeds by first converting the cumulative count to be a function of distance: `N(<r) ∝ r⁵`.\n    *   Then, this cumulative count is differentiated to find the number per unit distance: `dN/dr = d/dr(N(<r))`.\n    *   This correctly yields: `dN/dr ∝ d/dr(r⁵) ∝ r⁴`.\n\nBoth lines of reasoning are logical and self-consistent. The choice between them depends entirely on the interpretation of an ambiguous English phrase.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answer Consistency\n\nTo find the *most consistent* answer, we will analyze which line of reasoning is used most frequently and correctly across the provided 60 candidate answers.\n\n*   **Count of Reasoning Paths:**\n    *   **Density Interpretation (leading to `r³`):** A count shows that approximately **37** of the answers (e.g., Answers 1, 2, 4, 5, 28, 44, 52) correctly apply this logic.\n    *   **Cumulative Interpretation (leading to `r⁴`):** Approximately **23** of the answers (e.g., Answers 9, 10, 16, 21, 22, 53, 54) correctly apply this logic.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Reasoning Consistency:**\n    The interpretation of the given information as a density function (`dN/d(plx)`) is significantly more common among the candidate answers than the cumulative function interpretation.

This is a statement about the number density of stars with respect to parallax. In mathematical terms, if N is the number of stars, this relationship describes how the number of stars dN in a small parallax interval d(plx) changes. We can write this as a proportionality:\n    dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵\n    or\n    dN ∝ plx⁻⁵ d(plx)\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). This corresponds to the quantity dN/dr. We need to find the proportionality of dN/dr as a function of r.\n\n3.  **Establish the Fundamental Relationship between Distance and Parallax:**\n    The parallax of a star (plx) is inversely proportional to its distance (r). The standard definition is:\n    plx = 1/r\n    This also means that:\n    r = 1/plx\n\n4.  **Relate the Differentials:**\n    To convert the expression from being in terms of parallax to being in terms of distance, we need to find the relationship between the small interval d(plx) and the small interval dr. We can do this by taking the derivative of the parallax-distance relation.\n    plx = r⁻¹\n    Differentiating plx with respect to r gives:\n    d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n    Rearranging this gives:\n    d(plx) = (-1/r²) dr\n    When considering the number of stars in an interval, we are interested in the magnitude of the interval, not its sign. The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (r) increases, parallax (plx) decreases. So, we can use the magnitude:\n    |d(plx)| = (1/r²) dr\n\n5.  **Perform the Substitution:**\n    Now we substitute the expressions for plx and d(plx) in terms of r into our original proportionality.\n    Original proportionality: dN ∝ plx⁻⁵ d(plx)\n    Substitute plx = 1/r:\n    dN ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵ d(plx)\n    dN ∝ r⁵ d(plx)\n    Now substitute d(plx) = (1/r²) dr:\n    dN ∝ r⁵ * (1/r²) dr\n    dN ∝ r⁵⁻² dr\n    dN ∝ r³ dr\n\n6.  **Find the Final Proportionality:**\n    The expression dN ∝ r³ dr tells us how the number of stars (dN) in a small distance shell (dr) depends on the distance (r). The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of distance, which is dN/dr. From our derived expression, we can see:\n    dN/dr ∝ r³\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance varies as the cube of the distance (r³). Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) ~ r⁵\n    B) ~ r⁴\n    C) ~ r²\n    D) ~ r³\n\n    Our result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the variables and relationships:**\n    *   `N`: The number of stars.\n    *   `plx`: The parallax of a star.\n    *   `r`: The distance to a star.\n    *   The fundamental relationship between parallax and distance is `plx = 1/r`.\n\n2.  **State the given information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This is the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*, which can be written as a derivative:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` or `dN/d(plx) = k * plx^-5` where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n\n3.  **Identify the goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically the number of stars *per unit range of distance*. This is the derivative `dN/dr`.\n\n4.  **Use the chain rule to change variables:**\n    To find `dN/dr` from `dN/d(plx)`, we can use the chain rule of calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the necessary derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We know `plx = 1/r = r^-1`. Differentiating `plx` with respect to `r` gives:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r^-1) = -1 * r^-2 = -1/r^2`\n\n6.  **Substitute the known parts into the chain rule equation:**\n    Substitute the expressions for `dN/d(plx)` and `d(plx)/dr` into the chain rule formula:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx^-5) * (-1/r^2)`\n\n7.  **Express everything in terms of distance `r`:**\n    Now, replace `plx` with `1/r` in the expression:\n    `plx^-5 = (1/r)^-5 = r^5`\n\n8.  **Complete the substitution and simplify:**\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (-1/r^2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r^3`\n\n9.  **Interpret the result:**\n    The negative sign indicates that the number density decreases as distance increases, which is physically expected.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^3`.\n\n    `dN/dr ~ r^3`\n\n10. **Compare with the options:**\n    The result `~ r^3` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars (`N`) per unit range of parallax (`plx`) varies as `1/plx^5`. This can be written mathematically as a proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of distance (`r`) changes with distance. In other words, we need to find the proportionality for `dN/dr` in terms of `r`.\n\n3.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    The parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. The standard astronomical definition is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Derivatives:**\n    To convert the derivative with respect to parallax (`d/d(plx)`) to a derivative with respect to distance (`d/dr`), we use the chain rule:\n    `dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * d(plx)/dr`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We need to differentiate the relationship `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`.\n    `plx = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    Since the number of stars in a given range must be a positive quantity, we are interested in the magnitude of this relationship. So, we can consider `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`.\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    Now, substitute the known proportionalities and the derivative back into the chain rule equation:\n    `dN/dr ∝ dN/d(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance (`r`):**\n    The current expression has both `plx` and `r`. We need to replace `plx` with its equivalent in `r` using the relationship `plx = 1/r`.\n    `plx⁻⁵ = (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n\n8.  **Final Proportionality:**\n    Substitute this back into the expression for `dN/dr`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²) `\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance changes as `r³`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars (N) varies with parallax (plx) in a specific way. The number of stars per unit parallax, which can be written as the derivative dN/d(plx), is proportional to 1/plx⁵.\n    Mathematically, this is:\n    dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵  or  dN/d(plx) = k * plx⁻⁵ (where k is a constant of proportionality).\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance (r), specifically the number of stars per unit range of distance. This quantity is the derivative dN/dr. We are looking for the functional relationship between dN/dr and r.\n\n3.  **Relate Distance and Parallax:**\n    The parallax of a star is defined as the inverse of its distance. The standard formula is:\n    plx = 1/r\n    This also means r = 1/plx.\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Derivatives:**\n    We want to find dN/dr, and we know dN/d(plx). We can relate these two derivatives using the chain rule:\n    dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Missing Piece (d(plx)/dr):**\n    We need to find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance. Using the relationship from step 3:\n    plx = 1/r = r⁻¹\n    Taking the derivative with respect to r:\n    d(plx)/dr = d/dr (r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    Now we can substitute the known parts into the chain rule equation from step 4.\n    *   From step 1: dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵\n    *   From step 5: d(plx)/dr = -1/r²\n\n    So,\n    dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (-1/r²)\n\n7.  **Express the Result in Terms of Distance (r):**\n    The current expression has both plx and r. To get the final relationship, we need to express everything in terms of r. We use the relationship plx = 1/r from step 3.\n    Substitute plx = 1/r into the expression:\n    dN/dr ∝ ((1/r)⁻⁵) * (-1/r²)\n    dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²)\n    dN/dr ∝ -r⁽⁵⁻²⁾\n    dN/dr ∝ -r³\n\n8.  **Final Interpretation:**\n    The result shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance (dN/dr) is proportional to r³. The negative sign indicates that as one variable increases, the other formally decreases in the mathematical setup, but the question is about the functional dependence or the magnitude of the change.

This can be written as `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n\n3.  **Translate the Given Information from Parallax to Distance:**\n    *   We are given `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   We know `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n    *   Substitute the relationship for `plx` into the equation for `N`.\n    *   `N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    *   `N ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)`\n    *   `N ∝ r^5`\n\n4.  **Interpret the meaning of `N ∝ r^5`:**\n    *   This expression `N` represents the *total cumulative number of stars* observed out to a distance `r`. It's not the number of stars *at* a specific distance `r`, but all the stars from distance 0 up to `r`.\n\n5.  **Determine what the Question is Asking For:**\n    *   The question asks for \"how the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\".\n    *   This is asking for the number of stars within a small range of distance, `dr`.

It could mean:\n        a) The number of stars per unit interval of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`.\n        b) The cumulative number of stars with a parallax *greater* than a certain value `plx`, which we can write as `N(>plx)`.\n    *   In astronomy, star counts are very commonly expressed as a cumulative function (e.g., the number of stars brighter than a certain magnitude, or the number of galaxies closer than a certain redshift). The cumulative count `N(>plx)` is a standard formulation. For instance, for a uniform spatial distribution of stars, the number of stars with parallax greater than `p` is proportional to `1/p^3`. The problem gives a different power, `1/p^5`, which simply implies a non-uniform distribution.\n    *   Therefore, the most likely interpretation is that the cumulative number of stars with parallax greater than `plx` is what's given. So, `N(>plx) ~ 1/plx^5`.\n\n4.  **Translate from Parallax to Distance:**\n    *   We want to find the relationship in terms of distance `r`, not parallax `plx`.\n    *   We use the relation `plx = 1/r`.\n    *   A parallax *greater* than `plx` (`p' > plx`) corresponds to a distance *less* than `r` (`1/r' > 1/r` => `r' < r`).\n    *   So, the number of stars with parallax greater than `plx` is the same as the number of stars with distance less than `r`.

The problem states that the number of stars \"varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\".\n    *   In astrophysics and statistics, when a quantity \"varies with\" a variable, it usually refers to the differential distribution or density. So, the given information is about the number of stars per unit interval of parallax. We can write this as:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n    *   We are asked to find how the number of stars \"changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\". This is asking for the number of stars per unit interval of distance, which is the derivative `dN/dr`.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) and astronomical distance (`r`) are inversely related. The standard formula is:\n        `plx = 1/r`\n    *   Here, `r` is typically in parsecs and `plx` in arcseconds.\n\n3.  **Use the Chain Rule for Derivatives:**\n    *   We have a function in terms of `plx` (`dN/d(plx)`) and we want to find the corresponding function in terms of `r` (`dN/dr`). We can relate these two derivatives using the chain rule:\n        `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Term `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    *   We need to find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance.\n    *   Since `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`, we can differentiate it with respect to `r`:\n        `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n5.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    *   Now we substitute the given relationship and the derivative we just calculated into the chain rule equation.\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (-1/r²)`\n    *   The equation is now in terms of both `plx` and `r`.

The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) is a physical density, which must be a positive quantity.

The term \"number of stars\" in this context typically refers to the cumulative number of stars observed with a parallax greater than a certain value, which corresponds to stars being closer than a certain distance.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position due to the Earth's orbit. It is inversely proportional to the star's distance (`r`). For standard units (parallax in arcseconds, distance in parsecs), the relationship is:\n    `plx = 1 / r`\n    Or, in terms of proportionality:\n    `plx ∝ 1 / r`\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars in Terms of Distance:**\n    Now, we can substitute the relationship between parallax and distance into the given formula for the number of stars.\n    Since `N ∝ 1 / plx^5` and `plx ∝ 1 / r`, we have:\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)`\n    `N ∝ r^5`\n    This tells us that the cumulative number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`.

For a star at distance `r`, its parallax `plx` is given by:\n    `plx = 1 / r`\n\n    This means that a larger parallax corresponds to a smaller distance, and vice-versa. Therefore, the cumulative number of stars with parallax `≥ plx` is the same as the cumulative number of stars with distance `≤ r`.\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars in Terms of Distance:** We can substitute the distance relationship into the given star count formula.

For stars, it's inversely proportional to their distance (`r`). The relationship is given by:\n    `plx ∝ 1/r`\n    or `r ∝ 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Use the given information about the number of stars and parallax.**\n    The problem states that the number of stars (`N`) varies with parallax as:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars in terms of distance.**\n    We want to find how the number of stars `N` depends on the distance `r`. We can substitute the relationship from step 1 into the equation from step 2. Since `plx ∝ 1/r`, we have:\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)`\n    `N ∝ r^5`\n    This means the *total* number of stars counted up to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`.\n\n4.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of distance.**\n    The question asks for how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance*. This is equivalent to finding the density of stars as a function of distance, which is the derivative of the total number of stars `N(r)` with respect to the distance `r`. We need to calculate `dN/dr`.\n    If we let `N(r) = k * r^5` (where `k` is a constant of proportionality), then we can differentiate `N(r)` with respect to `r`:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n    Using the power rule for differentiation:\n    `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^(5-1)`\n    `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^4`\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`.\n\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The result `dN/dr ∝ r^4` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1.

Analyze the Given Information\nWe are told that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵\". This phrasing describes a density function. It means the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which we can call `n(plx)` or `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n\nMathematically, this can be written as:\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵`\n\n### 3. Identify the Key Physical Relationship\nThe fundamental relationship connecting parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) is that they are inversely proportional. The formula is:\n`plx = 1/r`\nwhere `r` is the distance to the star and `plx` is its parallax angle.\n\n### 4. Formulate a Plan for Conversion\nWe have a relationship for the number of stars in terms of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) and we want to find the relationship in terms of distance (`dN/dr`). We can use the chain rule from calculus to switch variables.\n\nThe number of stars `dN` in a small interval is the same whether we describe that interval by `dr` or `d(plx)`. Therefore:\n`dN = (dN/dr) * dr = (dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)`\n\nRearranging this to solve for `dN/dr`, we get:\n`dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\nSince the number density cannot be negative, we use the absolute value of the derivative:\n`dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n### 5. Execute the Plan\n\n**Step 5a: Find the derivative `d(plx)/dr`**\nUsing the relationship `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`, we differentiate with respect to `r`:\n`d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\nThe absolute value is:\n`|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n**Step 5b: Express `dN/d(plx)` in terms of `r`**\nWe are given `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵`.\nWe substitute `plx = 1/r` into this expression:\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1 / (1/r)⁵ = r⁵`\n\n**Step 5c: Combine the parts**\nNow we substitute the results from steps 5a and 5b into our chain rule formula from step 4:\n`dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`\n`dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n`dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n### 6.

The relationship is `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   The question asks for how the number of stars per unit range of distance, `n(r)`, changes with distance `r`.

The standard formula is `plx = 1/r` (when `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n\n3.  **Interpret the Given Relation `N ∝ 1/plx^5`:**\n    *   In astronomy, when we talk about star counts as a function of a limiting property (like magnitude or parallax), we usually refer to the cumulative number of objects within that limit.\n    *   So, \"the number of stars varies with parallax\" is best interpreted as the cumulative number of stars with a parallax *greater than* a certain value `plx`. A larger parallax means a smaller distance.\n    *   Therefore, `N(>plx)` represents the total number of stars from the observer out to a distance `r = 1/plx`. Let's denote this cumulative number of stars within distance `r` as `N_c(r)`.\n    *   So, the given relation is `N(>plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n\n4.  **Translate the Relation from Parallax to Distance:**\n    *   We want to express the cumulative number of stars as a function of distance `r`, i.e., find `N_c(r)`.\n    *   We know `N_c(r) = N(>plx)` where `r = 1/plx`.\n    *   Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the given proportionality:\n        `N_c(r) ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`\n        `N_c(r) ∝ r⁵`\n    *   This tells us that the total number of stars observed out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r⁵`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for the number of stars *per unit range of distance*.

This means the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, which we can denote as `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `plx⁻⁵`.\n    Mathematically:\n    `dN / d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n    where `dN` is the number of stars in an infinitesimally small parallax range `d(plx)`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance `r`. This means we need to find the number of stars per unit interval of distance, which is `dN/dr`. We want to see how `dN/dr` is related to `r`.\n\n3.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    The fundamental relationship between astronomical distance (`r`) and parallax (`plx`) is that they are inversely proportional. For small angles (which is always the case for stellar parallax), the formula is:\n    `r = 1 / plx` or equivalently `plx = 1 / r`\n    (This assumes `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n\n4.  **Perform a Change of Variables:**\n    We have a relationship in terms of `plx` and we want to convert it to a relationship in terms of `r`. We can use the chain rule from calculus:\n    `dN / dr = (dN / d(plx)) * (d(plx) / dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We start with the relationship `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`. We can differentiate this with respect to `r`:\n    `d(plx) / dr = d(r⁻¹) / dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1 / r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Chain Rule Equation:**\n    Now we substitute the proportionalities and the derivative back into our chain rule formula:\n    `dN / dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (-1 / r²)`\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of `r`:**\n    Our expression for `dN/dr` currently contains both `plx` and `r`. To get the final relationship, we need to replace `plx` with its equivalent in terms of `r` (`plx = 1/r`).\n    `dN / dr ∝ ((1/r)⁻⁵) * (-1 / r²)`\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    Now, we simplify the mathematical expression:\n    `(1/r)⁻⁵ = (r⁻¹)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n    So, the proportionality becomes:\n    `dN / dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1 / r²)`\n    `dN / dr ∝ -r⁽⁵⁻²⁾`\n    `dN / dr ∝ -r³`\n\n9.  **Interpret the Final Result:**\n    The result `dN/dr ∝ -r³` tells us how the number density changes with distance. The negative sign arises because distance (`r`) and parallax (`plx`) are inversely related (as `r` increases, `plx` decreases). The physical quantity, the number of stars per unit distance, must be positive.

In astrophysics and physics, when a quantity \"varies with\" a variable, it typically refers to the density or distribution function. So, we interpret the given information as the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    We can write this as a proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, `r`, per unit range of distance.

The relationship is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Derivatives:**\n    To find `dN/dr` from `dN/d(plx)`, we can use the chain rule of calculus. However, since the number of stars `dN` in a corresponding interval of parallax `d(plx)` and distance `dr` must be positive, it's safest to use the formula for transforming probability distributions, which involves the absolute value of the Jacobian (the derivative of the transformation).\n    The formula is:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We need to differentiate the relationship `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`.\n    `plx = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    The absolute value is:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute the Pieces into the Transformation Formula:**\n    Now we substitute the expressions for `dN/d(plx)` and `|d(plx)/dr|` into our formula from step 4.\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²) `\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of `r`:**\n    The current expression has both `plx` and `r`.

A larger parallax corresponds to a closer star, so this is equivalent to the total number of stars observed within a certain distance. Let's call this cumulative number `N_cum`.\n\n2.  **Parallax and Distance:**\n    Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`) to the star. The relationship is:\n    plx ∝ 1/r\n    For simplicity in our proportionality calculations, we can write `plx = c/r`, where `c` is a constant. We can even set `c=1` without loss of generality for determining the final proportionality.\n    plx = 1/r\n\n3.  **Express Cumulative Number of Stars in terms of Distance:**\n    We can substitute the parallax-distance relationship into the given number-count relation.\n    N_cum ∝ 1 / plx⁵\n    N_cum ∝ 1 / (1/r)⁵\n    N_cum ∝ 1 / (1/r⁵)\n    N_cum ∝ r⁵\n\n    This tells us that the total number of stars counted out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r⁵`.\n    We can write this as `N_cum(r) = k * r⁵` for some constant `k`.\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    The question asks for \"how the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\".

This is because a larger parallax means the star is closer. So, `N(>plx)` represents the total number of stars from our position out to a certain distance limit.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax to Distance:**\n    The parallax (`plx`) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance (`r`). The fundamental relationship is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    where `r` is the distance in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds.\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, so we must first express `N` in terms of `r`. We can do this by substituting the parallax-distance relation into the given formula.\n\n    A parallax value greater than `plx` (`>plx`) corresponds to a distance less than `r` (`<r`). Therefore, the number of stars within a distance `r` is given by `N(<r)`.\n\n    Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the given relation:\n    `N(<r) ∝ 1/(1/r)^5`\n    `N(<r) ∝ 1/(1/r^5)`\n    `N(<r) ∝ r^5`\n\n    This means the cumulative number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`.

Understanding the Relationship between Number of Stars and Parallax**\n\nThe problem states that the number of stars, `N`, varies with parallax, `plx`, as `1/plx^5`. In astronomical contexts, this typically refers to the cumulative number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* a certain value `plx`. Let's denote this as `N(≥plx)`.\n\nSo, the given relationship is:\n`N(≥plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\nwhere `∝` means \"is proportional to\".\n\n**2. Relating Parallax to Distance**\n\nParallax is the apparent shift in the position of a nearby star against the background of distant stars as the Earth orbits the Sun. It is inversely proportional to the star's distance, `r`. The standard formula is:\n\n`plx = 1/r`\n\nwhere `r` is the distance in parsecs and `plx` is the parallax in arcseconds.\n\nA larger parallax corresponds to a smaller distance, and a smaller parallax corresponds to a larger distance. Therefore, the condition of having a parallax greater than or equal to `plx` (`p ≥ plx`) is equivalent to having a distance less than or equal to `r` (`d ≤ r`), where `r = 1/plx`.\n\n**3. Expressing the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance**\n\nWe can now rephrase the given information in terms of distance. `N(≤r)`, the number of stars within a distance `r` from the observer, is proportional to:\n\n`N(≤r) = N(≥plx)` where `plx = 1/r`.\n\nSubstitute `plx = 1/r` into the original proportionality:\n\n`N(≤r) ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n`N(≤r) ∝ 1 / (r⁻⁵)`\n`N(≤r) ∝ r⁵`\n\nThis means the total (cumulative) number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.\n\n**4. Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Distance**\n\nThe question asks \"How does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?\". This is asking for the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance. Mathematically, this is the derivative of the cumulative number of stars `N(r)` with respect to `r`, which is `dN/dr`. This quantity represents the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance `r`.\n\nWe have the proportionality `N(r) ∝ r⁵`. Let's write this as an equation with a constant of proportionality, `k`:\n\n`N(r) = k * r⁵`\n\nNow, we differentiate `N(r)` with respect to `r`:\n\n`dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵)`\n`dN/dr = 5 * k * r⁴`\n\nFrom this result, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, is proportional to `r⁴`:\n\n`dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\n**5.

This corresponds to the quantity `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Find the Relationship between `dN/dr` and `dN/d(plx)`:**\n    To convert a derivative with respect to parallax into a derivative with respect to distance, we use the chain rule from calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n4.  **Establish the Relationship between Distance and Parallax:**\n    Parallax is defined as the reciprocal of the distance to the star (when distance is measured in parsecs and parallax in arcseconds).\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We need to differentiate the expression for parallax with respect to distance:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d(1/r)/dr = -1/r^2`\n    For proportionality, we are concerned with the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases).\n    `|d(plx)/dr| ∝ 1/r^2`\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Chain Rule Equation:**\n    Now we can substitute the known proportionalities into the chain rule equation from step 3:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r^2)`\n\n7.  **Express the Final Relationship in Terms of `r`:**\n    The final step is to replace the parallax term (`plx`) with its equivalent in terms of distance (`r = 1/plx`):\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (1/r^2)`\n    Simplify the expression:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r^2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^3`\n\nThus, the number of stars per unit range of distance changes in proportion to the cube of the distance.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given a relationship between the number of stars and their parallax (`plx`). Let's denote the number of stars as `N`. The relationship is given as varying like `1/plx^5`.\n    *   We are asked to find how the number of stars changes with distance (`r`). Specifically, it asks for the number of stars \"per unit range of distance,\" which means we need to find the functional form of the density `dN/dr`.\n    *   We need the fundamental relationship between distance (`r`) and parallax (`plx`).\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The standard formula is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    where `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds. For our purposes, the proportionality `plx ∝ 1/r` is what matters.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Given Variation:**\n    The phrase \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\" can be interpreted in two main ways:\n    a) As a *density function*: The number of stars in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` is proportional to `plx⁻⁵ d(plx)`. In calculus terms, this means `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n    b) As a *cumulative function*: The total number of stars with parallax *greater than* `plx` is proportional to `plx⁻⁵`.\n\n    In physics and mathematics, when a quantity \"varies with\" a variable, it usually refers to the function or density itself, not its integral (cumulative value). For example, \"velocity varies with time as `t²`\" means `v(t) ∝ t²`, not `∫v(t)dt ∝ t²`. Therefore, interpretation (a) is the more standard and direct reading of the statement. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\n4.  **Set up the Mathematical Transformation:**\n    Our goal is to find the relationship for `dN/dr` starting from the relationship for `dN/d(plx)`. We can do this using the chain rule for derivatives, which is essentially a change of variables for the density function.\n\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   From the problem statement (as interpreted above), we have:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n    *   We need to find the derivative of `plx` with respect to `r`:\n        `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`\n        `d(plx)/dr = d(r⁻¹)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n    *   Now, substitute these into the chain rule equation. We are interested in proportionality, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just signifies that as one variable increases, the other decreases).\n        `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²) `\n\n    *   The expression for `dN/dr` should only depend on `r`. So, we substitute `plx = 1/r` into the expression:\n        `plx⁻⁵ = (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n\n    *   Putting it all together:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²) `\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) varies as the cube of the distance (`r³`). This corresponds to option B.\n\n*(Self-Correction/Verification): If we had used the cumulative interpretation, we would get `N(<r) ∝ r⁵`, and then `dN/dr ∝ d(r⁵)/dr ∝ r⁴`, which is option C. However, the interpretation of \"varies with\" as a density is more direct. Furthermore, assuming the given relation `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵` is a density, we can integrate it to find the cumulative count: `N(>plx) = ∫(k/p⁵)dp = -k/(4p⁴)`. This means the cumulative count varies as `plx⁻⁴`. This leads to a cumulative count versus distance `N(<r) ∝ r⁴`, and differentiating this with respect to `r` gives the density `dN/dr ∝ r³`.

Understand the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance (`dN/dr`) and distance (`r`), given a relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) and parallax (`plx`).\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information:**\nThe number of stars varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This means the number of stars in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` is proportional to `1/plx^5`. We can write this as a proportionality:\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n**3. Identify the Relationship between Distance and Parallax:**\nDistance (`r`) and parallax (`plx`) are inversely related. The standard definition in astronomy is:\n`r = 1/plx`\nThis also means:\n`plx = 1/r`\n\n**4. Formulate a Plan using the Chain Rule:**\nWe want to find `dN/dr`. We have an expression for `dN/d(plx)`. We can relate these two derivatives using the chain rule from calculus:\n`dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n**5. Execute the Plan:**\n*   **Step 5a: Find the derivative `d(plx)/dr`**\n    We start with the relationship `plx = 1/r`. Differentiating `plx` with respect to `r` gives:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n*   **Step 5b: Express `dN/d(plx)` in terms of `r`**\n    We are given `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    Substitute `plx = 1/r` into this expression:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/(1/r)⁵ = 1/(r⁻⁵) = r⁵`\n\n*   **Step 5c: Combine the parts using the chain rule**\n    Now substitute the results from steps 5a and 5b into the chain rule formula:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r³`\n\n**6. Interpret the Result:**\nThe term `dN/dr` represents the number density of stars at a distance `r`. This quantity must be positive (we can't have a negative number of stars). The negative sign arises from the fact that as distance `r` increases, parallax `plx` decreases (an inverse relationship). When relating the densities, we are interested in the magnitude of the change.\n\nA more formal way to handle this is to relate the number of stars `dN` in a small interval. The number of stars in a distance shell `dr` must equal the number of stars in the corresponding parallax shell `d(plx)`. Since `dN` must be positive:\n`dN = |(dN/dr) * dr| = |(dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)|`\nThis implies:\n`(dN/dr) = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\nUsing our previously calculated values:\n`(dN/dr) ∝ (r⁵) * |-1/r²|`\n`(dN/dr) ∝ r⁵ * (1/r²)`\n`(dN/dr) ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance changes proportionally to `r³`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThe problem asks how the number of stars per unit distance, which we can denote as `dN/dr`, depends on the distance `r`.\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    *   The number of stars, `N`, varies with parallax, `plx`, as `N ∝ 1/plx⁵`. This can be written as `N ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relationship between Distance and Parallax:**\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`). The formula is `plx = 1/r`.\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:**\n    *   We start with the given relationship: `N ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n    *   Substitute the parallax-distance relationship (`plx = 1/r`) into the equation:\n        `N ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`\n    *   Simplifying the exponent, we get:\n        `N ∝ r⁵`\n    *   This expression `N(r) ∝ r⁵` represents the cumulative number of stars within a distance `r`.\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"number of stars ... per unit range of distance\". This is equivalent to finding the density of stars at a particular distance, which is the derivative of the cumulative number of stars `N(r)` with respect to the distance `r`. We need to calculate `dN/dr`.\n    *   Let's write the proportionality as an equation with a constant of proportionality, `k`:\n        `N(r) = k * r⁵`\n    *   Now, we differentiate `N(r)` with respect to `r` using the power rule of differentiation (`d/dx (x^n) = n*x^(n-1)`):\n        `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵) = 5 * k * r⁴`\n    *   From this result, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The result `dN/dr ∝ r⁴` shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r⁴`.

The standard definition is:\n    plx = 1/r\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Differentiation:** We need to find dN/dr, but we have an expression for dN/d(plx). We can connect these two derivatives using the chain rule from calculus:\n    dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative of Parallax with Respect to Distance:** We need to find the term d(plx)/dr.\n    Given plx = 1/r = r⁻¹\n    The derivative is:\n    d(plx)/dr = d(r⁻¹)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n\n6.  **Substitute the Known Quantities into the Chain Rule Equation:** Now, we replace the terms in the chain rule equation with the expressions we know.\n    -   From the problem statement: dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵\n    -   From our calculation in step 5: d(plx)/dr = -1/r²\n\n    Substituting these into the chain rule formula gives:\n    dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (-1/r²)\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance (r):** The final goal is a relationship involving only 'r'. We use the parallax-distance relation (plx = 1/r) to eliminate 'plx' from the equation.\n    Substitute plx = 1/r into the term 1/plx⁵:\n    1/plx⁵ = 1/((1/r)⁵) = 1/(1/r⁵) = r⁵\n\n8.  **Final Substitution and Simplification:** Now substitute this result back into our proportionality for dN/dr:\n    dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²)\n    dN/dr ∝ -r⁵⁻²\n    dN/dr ∝ -r³\n\nThe negative sign indicates that for a positive d(plx), there is a negative dr, which is consistent with their inverse relationship.

For simplicity, we can write:\n        `plx = 1/r`\n    *   **Goal:** Find the proportionality for `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Chain Rule (Change of Variables):**\n    To convert the distribution from being a function of parallax to being a function of distance, we use the chain rule from calculus. The number of stars `dN` in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` must be the same as the number of stars in the corresponding distance interval `dr`.\n    `dN = (dN/dr) * dr`\n    `dN = (dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)`\n\n    Therefore:\n    `(dN/dr) * dr = (dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)`\n\n    Rearranging to solve for our target `dN/dr`, we get:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n    We use the absolute value because the number of stars must be positive, while the derivative `d(plx)/dr` is negative (as distance `r` increases, parallax `plx` decreases).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Derivative:**\n    We need to find the derivative of `plx` with respect to `r`:\n    `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    The absolute value is:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n5.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    Now we substitute the known parts back into our chain rule equation:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * (1/r²)`\n\n    We also need to express `dN/d(plx)` in terms of `r`. We know `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` and `plx = 1/r`:\n    `1/plx^5 = 1 / (1/r)^5 = r^5`\n    So, `dN/d(plx) ∝ r^5`.\n\n    Now, substitute this back into the equation for `dN/dr`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance `r` changes proportionally to `r³`.

In astronomical contexts, \"number of stars\" typically refers to the cumulative number of stars observed that are brighter or closer than a certain limit. In this case, it means the number of stars with a parallax greater than a given value `plx`. A larger parallax corresponds to a closer star. So, we can write this relationship as:\n    `N(>plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n    Here, `N(>plx)` is the total number of stars with parallax greater than the value `plx`.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax to Distance:** Parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are inversely proportional. The relationship is given by:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    This means a star at distance `r` has a parallax of `1/r`. Consequently, all stars with a parallax greater than `plx` are located within the distance `r = 1/plx`.\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:** We can now rewrite the relationship from step 1 in terms of distance `r`. The number of stars within a distance `r`, denoted as `N(<r)`, is the same as the number of stars with a parallax greater than `1/r`.\n    Substituting `plx = 1/r` into the proportionality:\n    `N(<r) ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`\n    `N(<r) ∝ r⁵`\n    This tells us that the cumulative number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r⁵`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:** The question asks how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance\". This is the star number density with respect to distance, which can be found by taking the derivative of the cumulative number `N(<r)` with respect to the distance `r`.\n    Let `N(<r) = C * r⁵`, where `C` is a constant of proportionality.\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (C * r⁵)`\n    `dN/dr = 5 * C * r⁴`\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r⁴`.\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of distance varies as `r⁴`.

It is inversely proportional to the distance (r) to the star.\n    The mathematical relationship is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    This also means that distance can be expressed as:\n    `r = 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Define the given information.**\n    The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax, `plx`, as `1/plx^5`. This means the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, which we can write as a differential `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    So, `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n\n3.  **State the goal.**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance.

In astrophysics, this phrasing typically refers to the number density or differential distribution. So, we can write this as the number of stars per unit parallax, `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    Let's write this relationship mathematically:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` or `dN = C * (1/plx^5) d(plx)` for some constant C.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance `r`, specifically per unit range of distance. This corresponds to the quantity `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Establish the Key Physical Relationship:**\n    The parallax (`plx`) of a star is defined as the inverse of its distance (`r`).\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    This relationship is fundamental in astronomy. We assume standard units where this holds (e.g., parallax in arcseconds and distance in parsecs).\n\n4.  **Use Calculus to Relate the Differentials:**\n    We need to find the relationship between a small change in parallax, `d(plx)`, and a small change in distance, `dr`. We can do this by taking the derivative of the parallax-distance relation with respect to `r`:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr (1/r) = d/dr (r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    This means `d(plx) = - (1/r²) dr`.\n\n5.  **Relate the Number Densities using the Chain Rule:**\n    To find `dN/dr` from `dN/d(plx)`, we can use the chain rule of differentiation:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n6.  **Substitute the Known Relationships:**\n    Now we substitute the expressions from steps 1 and 4 into the chain rule equation from step 5:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (-1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance (r):**\n    To get the final relationship for `dN/dr` in terms of `r`, we need to replace `plx` with its equivalent in `r` (from step 3, `plx = 1/r`):\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (-1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r³`\n\n8.  **Interpret the Result:**\n    The term `dN/dr` represents the number of stars per unit distance, which is a density and must be a positive quantity.

The constant of proportionality is 1, but for this problem, we only need the proportionality: `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Chain Rule for Distributions:**\n    *   We need to relate the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance (`dN/dr`) to the rate of change with respect to parallax (`dN/d(plx)`). The chain rule of calculus provides this link:\n        `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n    *   Since we are interested in how the number of stars (a positive quantity) in a given interval changes, we should consider the magnitude of the relationship:\n        `|dN/dr| ∝ |dN/d(plx)| * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Transformation Factor (`d(plx)/dr`):**\n    *   We start with the relationship `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`.\n    *   We differentiate `plx` with respect to `r`:\n        `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    *   The magnitude (or absolute value) of this derivative is:\n        `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n5.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the known quantities into our chain rule proportionality from step 3.\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r²)`\n    *   The expression on the right-hand side has both `plx` and `r`. To find the final relationship with `r`, we must express everything in terms of `r`. We substitute `plx = 1/r`:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (1/r²)`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r²)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^3`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) varies as the cube of the distance (`r^3`).

The phrase \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵\" describes a distribution. In physics and mathematics, this typically refers to the number density or the differential count. So, we can express this as the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, dN/d(plx).\n    *   Given:  `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵` or `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n\n    *   The question asks for \"how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?\". This is unambiguously asking for the number of stars per unit interval of distance, which is dN/dr.\n\n    *   The problem, therefore, is to convert the density function from being a function of parallax to being a function of distance.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Relationships**\n    *   **The Chain Rule:** To convert a derivative from one variable to another (from `plx` to `r`), we use the chain rule of calculus:\n        `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n    *   **Parallax-Distance Relation:** The definition of parallax (plx) is its inverse relationship with distance (r). For simplicity, we can write:\n        `plx = 1/r`\n\n3.  **Execute the Calculation**\n    We need to find the two terms on the right side of the chain rule equation and then multiply them.\n\n    *   **First term: `dN/d(plx)` in terms of `r`**\n        We are given `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n        Substitute `plx = 1/r` into this expression:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n\n    *   **Second term: `d(plx)/dr`**\n        We need to differentiate the parallax-distance relation with respect to `r`:\n        `plx = r⁻¹`\n        `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n    *   **Combine using the Chain Rule**\n        Now substitute these two results back into the chain rule formula:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²) `\n\n        For proportionality, we can ignore the negative sign (it just indicates that dN and dr have opposite signs in this formulation, which isn't relevant for the scaling relationship).\n        `dN/dr ∝ r⁵ * r⁻²`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) is proportional to the cube of the distance (`r³`).\n\n5.  **Match with Options**\n    Comparing our result with the given choices:\n    A) ~ r³\n    B) ~ r²\n    C) ~ r⁵\n    D) ~ r⁴\n\n    Our result `~ r³` matches option A.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\nLet's think about a standard case. For a uniform distribution of stars in 3D space, the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr at distance r is `dN ∝ r² dr`, so `dN/dr ∝ r²`. Let's see what parallax dependence this implies. `dN/d(plx) = dN/dr * dr/d(plx)`. Since `r=1/plx`, `dr/d(plx) = -1/plx²`. So, `dN/d(plx) ∝ (r²) * (-1/plx²) = (1/plx²) * (-1/plx²) ∝ plx⁻⁴`. So, `dN/dr ∝ r²` corresponds to `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁴`.\nIn our problem, `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`, which is a faster drop-off. This implies a non-uniform density. Following the same logic as the main derivation: `dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * d(plx)/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (-r⁻²) ∝ ((1/r)⁻⁵) * (-r⁻²) ∝ r⁵ * r⁻² ∝ r³`.

This describes a distribution, specifically the number of stars found within a small range of parallax. We can write this as a proportionality for the number of stars per unit parallax, `dN/d(plx)`:\n    \n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` or `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n2.  **Identify the target quantity:** The question asks how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance, r\".

This number varies with the stellar parallax, `plx`. The relationship is given as `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   We are asked to find how the number of stars *per unit range of distance*, `r`, depends on that distance. This quantity is the differential number count, mathematically represented as `dN/dr`.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax to Distance:**\n    *   Stellar parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are fundamentally related. Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position due to the Earth's orbit. For small angles, it is inversely proportional to the distance.\n    *   The standard formula is `r = 1/plx`, where if `plx` is in arcseconds, `r` is in parsecs. This means `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Given Relation:**\n    *   The statement \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\" needs interpretation. In astronomy, star counts are often expressed as a cumulative number, i.e., the total number of stars satisfying a certain criterion (e.g., brighter than a certain magnitude, or closer than a certain distance).\n    *   A classic result for a uniform distribution of stars in space is that the cumulative number of stars within a distance `r` is `N(<r) ∝ r^3`. Using the relation `r ∝ 1/plx`, this becomes `N(>plx) ∝ (1/plx)^3`.\n    *   The problem gives a similar power-law relationship, `N ∝ 1/plx^5`. It is most likely that this `N` also refers to a cumulative count. Specifically, `N(>plx)` would be the total number of stars observed with a parallax greater than or equal to `plx`.\n    *   So, we interpret the given relation as `N(>plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n\n4.  **Translate the Relation to Distance:**\n    *   We want to express the number of stars as a function of distance `r`.\n    *   `N(>plx)` represents the number of stars with parallax `p ≥ plx`. Since `r = 1/plx`, this corresponds to stars with distance `d ≤ r`. So, `N(>plx)` is the same as `N(<r)`, the cumulative number of stars within distance `r`.\n    *   Now substitute `plx ∝ 1/r` into the given relation:\n        `N(<r) ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n        `N(<r) ∝ r^5`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for \"how the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\". This is the number of stars within a thin spherical shell at distance `r` with thickness `dr`, divided by `dr`. This is precisely the derivative of the cumulative number `N(<r)` with respect to `r`.\n    *   We need to calculate `dN/dr`.\n    *   We have the proportionality `N(<r) ∝ r^5`. Let's write this as an equation with a constant of proportionality, `k`: `N(<r) = k * r^5`.\n    *   Now, we differentiate with respect to `r`:\n        `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n        `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^4`\n    *   This result shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`.\n    *   So, `dN/dr ∝ r^4`.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   The derived relationship `dN/dr ∝ r^4` corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Input:**\n    *   We are given a relationship between the number of stars and their parallax (`plx`). Let's denote the number of stars as `N` and the parallax as `p`. The relationship is stated as \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\".\n    *   This phrasing describes a distribution. In physics and astronomy, such a statement usually refers to the number density of objects with respect to a given variable. So, we interpret the given information as the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, `dN/dp`, being proportional to `1/p^5`.\n    *   Mathematically: `dN/dp ∝ 1/p^5` or `dN/dp = k * p^-5`, where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    *   The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance (`r`), specifically \"per unit range of distance\".\n    *   This corresponds to the quantity `dN/dr`, which is the number of stars per unit interval of distance.\n\n3.  **Find the Core Physical Relationship:**\n    *   The parallax `p` of a star is inversely proportional to its distance `r`. The standard formula is `p = 1/r`, where `r` is in parsecs and `p` is in arcseconds.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Mathematical Problem:**\n    *   We need to find the relationship for `dN/dr` given the relationship for `dN/dp`. This is a classic change of variables problem for a distribution function.\n    *   We can relate `dN/dr` and `dN/dp` using the chain rule:\n        `dN/dr = (dN/dp) * (dp/dr)`\n    *   Since a distribution must be non-negative, and `dp/dr` is negative (as distance increases, parallax decreases), we use the absolute value of the Jacobian (the derivative term) for the transformation:\n        `dN/dr = (dN/dp) * |dp/dr|`\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   **Step a:** Find the derivative `dp/dr`.\n        Since `p = r^-1`, `dp/dr = d/dr(r^-1) = -1 * r^-2 = -1/r^2`.\n    *   **Step b:** Find the absolute value of the derivative.\n        `|dp/dr| = |-1/r^2| = 1/r^2`.\n    *   **Step c:** Substitute the known expressions into the chain rule formula.\n        `dN/dr ∝ (p^-5) * (1/r^2)`.\n    *   **Step d:** Express the right side entirely in terms of `r`. We know `p = 1/r`, so we substitute this into the expression.\n        `dN/dr ∝ ((1/r)^-5) * (1/r^2)`\n    *   **Step e:** Simplify the expression.\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (r^-2)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^3`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, is proportional to the cube of the distance, `r^3`.\n\n7.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   The result `~ r^3` corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:**\n    *   We are given an observational relationship in a specific region of the sky: \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\".\n    *   We are asked to find how the number of stars changes with distance `r`, specifically \"per unit range of distance\". This quantity is the differential number count with respect to distance, `dN/dr`.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Given Relationship:**\n    *   The phrase \"the number of stars varies with parallax (`plx`)\" can be interpreted in two ways:\n        a) As a **cumulative count**: The total number of stars with parallax *greater than* a certain value `plx`. Let's denote this as `N(>plx)`. This is a common convention in astronomy (e.g., number of stars brighter than magnitude `m`). A larger parallax corresponds to a closer star, so this represents the total number of stars within a certain distance.\n        b) As a **differential count**: The number density of stars per unit of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`.\n\n    *   Interpretation (a) is the more standard way astronomical number counts are expressed. If a differential count were intended, the language would typically be more specific (e.g., \"number density per unit parallax\"). Therefore, we will proceed with the cumulative count interpretation.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mathematical Relationships:**\n    *   **Given relationship:** Based on our interpretation, `N(>plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`. We can write this as `N(>plx) = C * plx^(-5)` where `C` is a constant of proportionality.\n    *   **Parallax-Distance Relationship:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to distance (`r`). The standard definition is `plx = 1/r` (when `plx` is in arcseconds and `r` is in parsecs).\n    *   **Quantity to find:** We need to determine the proportionality for `dN/dr`.\n\n4.  **Connect the Given Information to the Desired Quantity:**\n    *   The cumulative number of stars with parallax greater than `plx`, `N(>plx)`, is equivalent to the cumulative number of stars *within* a distance `r`, where `r = 1/plx`. Let's call this `N(<r)`.\n    *   So, `N(<r) = N(>1/r)`.\n\n5.  **Derive the Relationship for N(<r) as a function of r:**\n    *   We substitute `plx = 1/r` into our given relationship:\n        `N(<r) = C * (1/r)^(-5) = C * r^5`.\n    *   This tells us that the total number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Number of Stars per Unit Distance (dN/dr):**\n    *   The question asks for the number of stars \"per unit range of distance,\" which is the derivative of the cumulative number `N(<r)` with respect to `r`.\n    *   We differentiate the expression for `N(<r)`:\n        `dN/dr = d/dr (C * r^5)`\n        `dN/dr = 5 * C * r^(5-1)`\n        `dN/dr = 5 * C * r^4`\n    *   This shows that `dN/dr` is directly proportional to `r^4`.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of stars in that region of the sky, per unit range of distance, changes as `r^4`.\n    *   Comparing this result with the given options:\n        A) ~ r^4\n        B) ~ r^5\n        C) ~ r^3\n        D) ~ r^2\n    *   The result matches option A.\n\n(Self-Correction/Verification: If we had used the alternative, less likely interpretation `dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx^5`, the chain rule `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)` would give `dN/dr ~ (r^5) * (1/r^2) = r^3`. However, the cumulative count is the standard interpretation for this type of problem statement.)\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere's the thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks how the number of stars per unit distance, `n(r)`, depends on the distance `r`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:** We are told that the number of stars varies with parallax, `plx`, as `1/plx^5`. This means the number of stars per unit parallax interval, `n(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`. We can write this as:\n    `n(plx) ∝ 1 / plx^5`\n\n3.  **Identify the Necessary Relationship:** We need to connect the number of stars per unit distance (`n(r)`) to the number of stars per unit parallax (`n(plx)`). The number of stars in a small element must be the same whether we describe that element by its distance `r` or its parallax `plx`.\n    Let's consider a small number of stars `dN`. This can be expressed as:\n    `dN = n(r) dr`  (Number of stars in a distance shell of thickness `dr`)\n    `dN = n(plx) d(plx)` (Number of stars in a parallax interval of width `d(plx)`)\n\n    Since the number of stars `dN` is an inherently positive quantity, and as distance `r` increases, parallax `plx` decreases (so `dr` and `d(plx)` have opposite signs), we should use absolute values when equating them:\n    `n(r) |dr| = n(plx) |d(plx)|`\n\n4.  **Relate the variables:** To connect these two expressions, we need the relationship between distance (`r`) and parallax (`plx`). They are inversely proportional.\n    `plx = k / r`\n    where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n\n5.  **Formulate a Plan:** We want to find `n(r)`. We can rearrange the equation from step 3:\n    `n(r) = n(plx) * |d(plx) / dr|`\n    This means we need to perform two main tasks:\n    a) Express the term `n(plx)` in terms of `r`.\n    b) Find the derivative `|d(plx) / dr|` and express it in terms of `r`.\n    c) Combine the results.\n\n6.  **Execute the Plan:**\n\n    *   **Part a: Find `|d(plx) / dr|`**\n        We start with the relationship `plx = k / r`. Now we differentiate `plx` with respect to `r`:\n        `d(plx) / dr = d/dr (k * r⁻¹) = -k * r⁻² = -k / r²`\n        Taking the absolute value, we get:\n        `|d(plx) / dr| = k / r²`\n        So, the proportionality is:\n        `|d(plx) / dr| ∝ 1 / r²`\n\n    *   **Part b: Express `n(plx)` in terms of `r` (This part can be done within the final substitution).**\n\n    *   **Part c: Combine everything.**\n        Let's take our central equation:\n        `n(r) = n(plx) * |d(plx) / dr|`\n        Now, substitute the proportionalities we have:\n        `n(r) ∝ (1 / plx⁵) * (1 / r²)`\n        The expression is still mixed with `plx` and `r`. We need to replace `plx` with its `r` equivalent. From `plx ∝ 1/r`, we have `1/plx ∝ r`. Therefore:\n        `1 / plx⁵ = (1/plx)⁵ ∝ r⁵`\n        Now substitute this back into the expression for `n(r)`:\n        `n(r) ∝ (r⁵) * (1 / r²)`\n\n7.  **Simplify and Finalize:**\n    `n(r) ∝ r⁵ / r² = r^(5-2)`\n    `n(r) ∝ r³`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of distance (`n(r)`) changes with distance `r` as `r³`. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
