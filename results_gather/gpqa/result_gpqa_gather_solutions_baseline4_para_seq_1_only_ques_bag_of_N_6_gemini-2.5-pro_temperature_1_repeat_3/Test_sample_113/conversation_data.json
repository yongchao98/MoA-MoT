This is a classic **cyanohydrin formation** reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The nucleophilic cyanide ion (⁻CN) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This forms an alkoxide intermediate: CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃.\n        3.  This negatively charged alkoxide ion needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. Looking at the options for A, `H₃O⁺` represents an acidic medium (like adding dilute HCl or H₂SO₄), which serves as the required proton source. `NaHSO₃` is used for forming bisulfite addition products and is not the standard reagent for this protonation step. Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n    *   **Reactant:** A nitrile compound (specifically, an α-hydroxy nitrile). The key functional group undergoing reaction is the nitrile group (-C≡N).\n    *   **Product:** A carboxylic acid. The nitrile group (-C≡N) has been converted into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Transformation:** This reaction is the **hydrolysis of a nitrile**.\n    *   **Conditions:** Nitrile hydrolysis is typically carried out by heating with either a strong aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) or a strong aqueous base (like NaOH). The presence of `H₂O` is explicitly mentioned.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B must be the catalyst for this hydrolysis.\n        *   `HCl` is a strong acid and is a standard reagent for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid and is generally not effective enough to perform this hydrolysis efficiently.\n    *   Therefore, the most suitable reagent for **B is HCl**.\n\n3.  **Combine the findings and select the correct option:**\n    *   We have determined that A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   We have determined that B = HCl.\n    *   Matching this with the given choices:\n        *   A) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH (Incorrect)\n        *   B) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl (Correct)\n        *   C) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl (Incorrect)\n        *   D) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH (Incorrect)\n\nThe correct combination of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   The first reaction is the conversion of butan-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile using sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   This is a classic example of **cyanohydrin formation**.\n    *   The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   This initial attack forms an alkoxide intermediate: `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   To obtain the final product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, this negatively charged alkoxide ion must be protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   Reagent **A** must therefore be a source of protons (H⁺).\n    *   Looking at the options for A:\n        *   `H3O⁺` represents an acidic aqueous solution, which is a suitable proton source for this step.\n        *   `NaHSO3` (sodium bisulfite) reacts with ketones to form bisulfite addition products, which is a different type of reaction and not what is needed here.\n    *   Therefore, reagent **A** must be `H3O⁺`. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   The second reaction is the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.\n    *   The key transformation is the conversion of a nitrile group (`-C≡N`) into a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`).\n    *   This reaction is the **hydrolysis of a nitrile**.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) or a strong base (like NaOH), typically with heating. The presence of `(H2O)` indicates water is the reactant, and B is the catalyst.\n    *   Let's evaluate the remaining options for reagent **B** (from options A and B):\n        *   `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a standard, effective catalyst for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   `CH3COOH` (Acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it could theoretically catalyze the reaction, it is far less effective than a strong acid, and the reaction would be very slow or incomplete. For a practical synthesis, a strong acid like HCl is used.\n    *   Therefore, the most suitable reagent for **B** is `HCl`.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A is `H3O⁺`.\n    *   Reagent B is `HCl`.\n    *   This combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction starts with the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n        *   `CH₃C(=O)CH₂CH₃ + CN⁻ → CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃`\n    *   This alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin.\n        *   `CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃C(OH)(CN)CH₂CH₃`\n    *   Reagent A must provide the proton (H⁺). The general representation for an acid in an aqueous solution is the hydronium ion, H₃O⁺. While the reaction is often buffered or performed by generating HCN in situ, H₃O⁺ correctly represents the necessary acidic workup or proton source. NaHSO₃ is incorrect as it would form a bisulfite addition product, which is a different reaction pathway.\n    *   Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This process is known as hydrolysis.\n    *   **Conditions:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires harsh conditions, typically heating in the presence of a strong acid or a strong base.\n    *   **Reagent B:** We need a reagent that can catalyze this hydrolysis in the presence of water.\n        *   `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a standard reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles.\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (Acetic acid) is a weak acid and is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a stable nitrile to a carboxylic acid under typical conditions.\n    *   Therefore, a strong acid like **B = HCl** is the suitable reagent.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, A is H₃O⁺ and B is HCl. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone (butan-2-one).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction proceeds via nucleophilic addition. The cyanide ion (CN⁻), from NaCN, acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n        `CH3-C(=O)-CH2CH3 + CN⁻ → CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2CH3`\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** The alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin. Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺).\n        `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2CH3 + H⁺ → CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2CH3`\n    *   **Evaluating Options for A:**\n        *   **H₃O⁺:** This represents an acidic aqueous solution (e.g., adding HCl or H₂SO₄ to water). It is a strong source of protons and is commonly used in an acidic workup step to protonate intermediates like the alkoxide formed here. This is a suitable choice for A.\n        *   **NaHSO₃:** Sodium bisulfite is a reagent that also adds to ketones, but it forms a bisulfite addition product, not a cyanohydrin. It is used for purification, not as a proton source in this context. Therefore, NaHSO₃ is not the correct reagent for A.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be **H₃O⁺**. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base in the presence of water, usually with heating. The reaction proceeds in two stages: first to an amide, and then the amide is further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid.\n        `R-C≡N + 2 H₂O --(catalyst)--> R-COOH + NH₃ (or NH₄⁺ in acid)`\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n    *   **Evaluating Options for B:**\n        *   **HCl:** Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid. Strong acids are effective catalysts for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. The reaction mixture would be acidic, yielding the carboxylic acid directly.\n        *   **CH₃COOH:** Acetic acid is a weak acid. While it can theoretically catalyze the reaction, the hydrolysis of nitriles requires harsh conditions (strong acid or strong base). A weak acid like acetic acid is generally not effective enough to drive the reaction to completion in a reasonable timeframe.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The most suitable catalyst for this transformation is a strong acid, **HCl**.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n    *   Comparing this with the given choices:\n        A) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH\n        B) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl\n        C) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH\n        D) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl\n    *   The correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   This reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone (butan-2-one).\n    *   The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.

The reaction involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the carbonyl carbon of a ketone (butan-2-one).\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The nucleophile, cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the C=O pi bond and forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n        2.  The negatively charged oxygen atom of the alkoxide intermediate is then protonated by a proton source to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin product.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be the proton source required for the second step of the mechanism. Looking at the options for A:\n        *   `NaHSO₃` (Sodium bisulfite): This reagent is used to form bisulfite addition products, which is a different reaction. It is not a proton source in the context of cyanohydrin formation.\n        *   `H₃O⁺` (Hydronium ion): This represents an acidic aqueous solution (e.g., dilute HCl or H₂SO₄). An acid is the perfect source of protons to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. While the reaction needs free CN⁻ and is often run under slightly acidic or buffered conditions (pH 4-5) to avoid protonating all the cyanide to HCN (a weaker nucleophile), an acid source (represented by H₃O⁺) is essential for the final protonation step.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be `H₃O⁺`. This eliminates options A and D. We are left with options B and C.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base, typically with heating.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is treated with a strong aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄, often represented as H₃O⁺) and heated. The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion.\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is treated with a strong aqueous base (like NaOH) and heated. This forms a carboxylate salt, which must then be treated with acid in a separate workup step to yield the final carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B, used with water (H₂O), acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis. Let's examine the options for B from the remaining choices (B and C):\n        *   `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid): This is a strong mineral acid. It is a standard and effective reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles.\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (Acetic acid): This is a weak organic acid. While it is an acid, it is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a stable nitrile to a carboxylic acid in a reasonable timeframe.

A nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone (butan-2-one).\n    2.  **Mechanism:**\n        *   The cyanide ion, provided by NaCN, attacks the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        *   This breaks the C=O pi bond, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃`.\n        *   This negatively charged alkoxide ion needs to be protonated to form the final stable product, the cyanohydrin (which has a hydroxyl group, -OH).\n    3.  **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a proton source to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. In a laboratory setting, this is typically achieved by adding an acid. H₃O⁺ (the hydronium ion) is the general representation for an acid in an aqueous solution (like HCl or H₂SO₄ in water). While adding strong acid directly to NaCN is hazardous (produces toxic HCN gas), the reaction is often carried out by mixing the ketone and NaCN, and then slowly adding acid. Thus, H₃O⁺ represents the necessary acid for the protonation step. NaHSO₃ is used for forming bisulfite adducts, which is a different reaction.\n    4.  **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n    1.  **Reaction Type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n    2.  **Conditions:** Nitrile hydrolysis requires harsh conditions, meaning either a strong acid or a strong base with heat.\n    3.  **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B, in the presence of water, must facilitate this hydrolysis.\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid and is not strong enough to effectively hydrolyze a stable nitrile group.\n        *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid. Heating a nitrile with a strong aqueous acid like HCl or H₂SO₄ is a standard method to hydrolyze it completely to a carboxylic acid.\n    4.  **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B is HCl.\n\n*   **Overall Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n    *   This combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n*   **Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n    *   This reaction is a **cyanohydrin formation**.

The `CN-` ion attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a C-C bond and pushing the pi electrons from the C=O double bond onto the oxygen atom. This creates an alkoxide intermediate: `CH3-C(O-)(CN)-CH2-CH3`.\n        2.  This negatively charged alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (`-OH`) group. Reagent `A` must be a proton source.\n    *   Looking at the options for `A`:\n        *   `NaHSO3` (sodium bisulfite) is a salt and not a primary proton source in this context. While it can form addition products with ketones, it's not the reagent for this specific transformation.\n        *   `H3O+` represents an acidic aqueous solution (e.g., dilute HCl or H2SO4).

The product is a carboxylic acid, not a carboxylate salt, which suggests an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis or a base-catalyzed hydrolysis followed by an acidic workup. In acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, a strong acid is used to protonate the nitrile nitrogen, making the carbon more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water. The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as a catalyst for the hydrolysis. Strong acids like HCl or H₂SO₄ are very effective for this transformation, and the reaction is typically heated.

It is a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group.\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This addition breaks the pi bond of the C=O group, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n        3.  This negatively charged alkoxide ion needs to be protonated to form the final stable product with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of reagent A:** Reagent A must be a proton source to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. A common way to achieve this is through an acidic workup. H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion, representing an aqueous acid like HCl or H₂SO₄) is the standard reagent for this protonation step. Therefore, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   Considering the options, NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfite) forms a different type of adduct with ketones and is incorrect for this synthesis.

The nitrile group has been converted into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** This transformation is the hydrolysis of a nitrile. Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is typically heated with a strong aqueous mineral acid, such as HCl or H₂SO₄. The nitrile is first protonated, attacked by water, and eventually converted to a carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion.\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous base (e.g., NaOH), which initially forms a carboxylate salt. An acidic workup is then needed to protonate the carboxylate to get the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Role of reagent B:** Reagent B, along with water (H₂O), is the catalyst for this hydrolysis reaction to directly form the carboxylic acid.\n        *   Comparing the choices for B in the remaining options A and C:\n            *   **B = HCl (from option A):** Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and is a standard and effective reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles.\n            *   **B = CH₃COOH (from option C):** Acetic acid is a weak acid. While it might catalyze the reaction under harsh conditions (very long reaction times and high temperatures), it is not a typical or efficient reagent for nitrile hydrolysis.

This is a classic **cyanohydrin formation** reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   Sodium cyanide (NaCN) dissociates in the solvent to provide the nucleophilic cyanide ion (⁻CN).\n    *   The cyanide ion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction.\n        `CH₃CH₂-CO-CH₃ + ⁻CN → CH₃CH₂-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₃` (This creates an alkoxide intermediate).\n    *   The negatively charged oxygen of the alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        `CH₃CH₂-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃CH₂-C(OH)(CN)-CH₃`\n    *   Therefore, reagent **A** must be a source of protons (H⁺).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options for A:**\n    *   **H₃O⁺:** This represents a strong acid in an aqueous solution (like HCl or H₂SO₄). It is a direct source of protons and is commonly used to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. While mixing NaCN and a strong acid directly can be hazardous due to the release of toxic HCN gas, the acid is often added slowly to the reaction mixture, or the H₃O⁺ simply denotes the proton source required to complete the reaction. It is a chemically correct choice for providing the necessary proton.\n    *   **NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfite):** This reagent typically adds to aldehydes and some ketones to form crystalline bisulfite adducts. It is used for purification, not as a proton source for cyanohydrin formation. It would compete with the cyanide ion. Thus, it is not the correct reagent for A.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be H₃O⁺.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the presence of water and reagent B. This is a **nitrile hydrolysis** reaction. The complex substituent \"2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxy...\" is just the 'R' group of the nitrile and does not participate in the core reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis requires a catalyst, which can be either an acid (H⁺) or a base (OH⁻), and usually requires heat. The overall reaction is:\n        `R-CN + 2 H₂O --(catalyst)--> R-COOH + NH₃` (or its protonated/deprotonated form depending on the pH).\n    *   Reagent **B** is the catalyst for this hydrolysis.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options for B:**\n    *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong acid. Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles is a standard and effective method. The strong acid protonates the nitrile nitrogen, making the carbon more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water. It is a very common reagent for this transformation.\n    *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid):** This is a weak acid. While technically an acid catalyst, it is much less effective than a strong mineral acid like HCl. Nitrile hydrolysis is often a sluggish reaction, and a weak acid like acetic acid would likely result in very low yield or require extremely harsh conditions (very high temperature and pressure). Therefore, HCl is the much more suitable reagent.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B is HCl.\n\n### **Final Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n*   Reagent B is HCl.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reagents, A and B.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction starts with a ketone (butan-2-one) and adds a cyanide group (-CN) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) to the carbonyl carbon.

This process is known as **nitrile hydrolysis**. The rest of the molecule (the large organic scaffold) remains unchanged.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis requires water (H₂O), which is indicated in the problem.\n    *   The reaction is typically very slow and must be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base. It often requires heating as well.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** In the presence of a strong acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄), the nitrile is protonated, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water. This proceeds through an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid and an ammonium salt.\n    *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** In the presence of a strong base (like NaOH), the hydroxide ion attacks the nitrile carbon. This also proceeds through an amide intermediate to form a carboxylate salt, which is then protonated in a final acidic workup step to yield the carboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **Determine the role and identity of reagent B:**\n    *   Reagent B must act as a catalyst for the hydrolysis of the nitrile.\n    *   Looking at the options for B:\n        *   `HCl`: Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and is a very common and effective catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis. This is a suitable choice.\n        *   `CH₃COOH`: Acetic acid is a weak acid. While it might catalyze the reaction to a very small extent, it is not an effective or standard reagent for this transformation.

Let's verify the structure. Butan-2-one is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃. The reaction adds a -CN and a -H to the C=O double bond. The oxygen becomes -OH. The product is CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃. The IUPAC name for this structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which matches the product given.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction proceeds via nucleophilic addition of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone.\n        1.  `CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃ + CN⁻ ⇌ CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃` (tetrahedral intermediate/alkoxide)\n        2.  `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃` (product)\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** The second step requires a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the intermediate alkoxide.\n    *   **Evaluating options for A:**\n        *   `H₃O⁺`: This is an excellent source of protons. The reaction is often catalyzed by acid. A common procedure involves adding an acid like HCl or H₂SO₄ to a mixture of the ketone and NaCN. The acid provides H₃O⁺, which catalyzes the reaction and provides the necessary proton for the final step. While adding strong acid directly to NaCN can produce dangerous HCN gas, it's a standard representation for the required acidic conditions.\n        *   `NaHSO₃`: Sodium bisulfite reacts with ketones to form bisulfite addition products (`R₂C(OH)SO₃Na`). This is a separate reaction and would compete with, rather than facilitate, the cyanohydrin formation.

This is the corresponding α-hydroxy carboxylic acid. The reaction replaces the -CN group with a -COOH group, which is a characteristic nitrile hydrolysis.\n    *   **Conditions:** Nitrile hydrolysis is typically performed under strong acidic or strong basic conditions, usually with heating.\n        *   **Acidic Hydrolysis:** R-CN + 2 H₂O + H⁺ (catalyst) → R-COOH + NH₄⁺\n        *   **Basic Hydrolysis:** R-CN + OH⁻ (catalyst) + H₂O → R-COO⁻ + NH₃. An acid workup (H₃O⁺) is then needed to get the carboxylic acid R-COOH.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Since the product is the carboxylic acid directly (R-COOH) and not its salt (R-COO⁻), and water is a reactant, this points towards an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Reagent B is the acid catalyst.\n    *   **Evaluating options for B:**\n        *   `HCl`: Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid, commonly used to catalyze the hydrolysis of nitriles. Its presence provides the necessary H₃O⁺ ions in water to drive the reaction.\n        *   `CH₃COOH`: Acetic acid is a weak acid.

    "Based on a thorough analysis of the provided chemical reactions, I will now detail my reasoning and determine the most consistent answer.\n\n**Detailed Reasoning and Analysis**\n\nThe task requires selecting the appropriate reagents for two separate reactions. Let's analyze each one step-by-step.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction transforms a ketone (butan-2-one) into a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile). This is a well-known nucleophilic addition reaction to a carbonyl group.\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:** The reaction proceeds in two main steps:\n    *   **Nucleophilic Attack:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻), provided by sodium cyanide (NaCN), is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the C=O pi bond and forms an alkoxide intermediate: `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃`.\n    *   **Protonation:** The negatively charged alkoxide intermediate is then protonated by an acid source to form the final stable hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃`\n3.  **Determine the role and identity of Reagent A:** Reagent 'A' must be the source of protons (H⁺) needed for the final protonation step.\n    *   Let's evaluate the options for 'A': `H₃O⁺` and `NaHSO₃`.\n    *   `H₃O⁺` (hydronium ion) represents an aqueous acid solution (e.g., dilute HCl or H₂SO₄). This is an excellent source of protons and is the standard reagent used to complete this reaction, typically as an acidic workup.\n    *   `NaHSO₃` (sodium bisulfite) is a different reagent that also adds to ketones, but it forms bisulfite addition products. It does not provide the proton needed for the cyanohydrin synthesis.\n    *   Therefore, the correct choice for **A is H₃O⁺**.

This is a classic **cyanohydrin formation** reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The nucleophilic cyanide ion (⁻CN) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This forms an alkoxide intermediate: CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃.\n        3.  This negatively charged alkoxide ion needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. Looking at the options for A, `H₃O⁺` represents an acidic medium (like adding dilute HCl or H₂SO₄), which serves as the required proton source. `NaHSO₃` is used for forming bisulfite addition products and is not the standard reagent for this protonation step. Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n    *   **Reactant:** A nitrile compound (specifically, an α-hydroxy nitrile). The key functional group undergoing reaction is the nitrile group (-C≡N).\n    *   **Product:** A carboxylic acid. The nitrile group (-C≡N) has been converted into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Transformation:** This reaction is the **hydrolysis of a nitrile**.\n    *   **Conditions:** Nitrile hydrolysis is typically carried out by heating with either a strong aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) or a strong aqueous base (like NaOH). The presence of `H₂O` is explicitly mentioned.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B must be the catalyst for this hydrolysis.\n        *   `HCl` is a strong acid and is a standard reagent for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid and is generally not effective enough to perform this hydrolysis efficiently.\n    *   Therefore, the most suitable reagent for **B is HCl**.\n\n3.  **Combine the findings and select the correct option:**\n    *   We have determined that A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   We have determined that B = HCl.\n    *   Matching this with the given choices:\n        *   A) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH (Incorrect)\n        *   B) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl (Correct)\n        *   C) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl (Incorrect)\n        *   D) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH (Incorrect)\n\nThe correct combination of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   The first reaction is the conversion of butan-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile using sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   This is a classic example of **cyanohydrin formation**.\n    *   The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   This initial attack forms an alkoxide intermediate: `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   To obtain the final product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, this negatively charged alkoxide ion must be protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   Reagent **A** must therefore be a source of protons (H⁺).\n    *   Looking at the options for A:\n        *   `H3O⁺` represents an acidic aqueous solution, which is a suitable proton source for this step.\n        *   `NaHSO3` (sodium bisulfite) reacts with ketones to form bisulfite addition products, which is a different type of reaction and not what is needed here.\n    *   Therefore, reagent **A** must be `H3O⁺`. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   The second reaction is the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.\n    *   The key transformation is the conversion of a nitrile group (`-C≡N`) into a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`).\n    *   This reaction is the **hydrolysis of a nitrile**.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) or a strong base (like NaOH), typically with heating. The presence of `(H2O)` indicates water is the reactant, and B is the catalyst.\n    *   Let's evaluate the remaining options for reagent **B** (from options A and B):\n        *   `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a standard, effective catalyst for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   `CH3COOH` (Acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it could theoretically catalyze the reaction, it is far less effective than a strong acid, and the reaction would be very slow or incomplete. For a practical synthesis, a strong acid like HCl is used.\n    *   Therefore, the most suitable reagent for **B** is `HCl`.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A is `H3O⁺`.\n    *   Reagent B is `HCl`.\n    *   This combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction starts with the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n        *   `CH₃C(=O)CH₂CH₃ + CN⁻ → CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃`\n    *   This alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin.\n        *   `CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃C(OH)(CN)CH₂CH₃`\n    *   Reagent A must provide the proton (H⁺). The general representation for an acid in an aqueous solution is the hydronium ion, H₃O⁺. While the reaction is often buffered or performed by generating HCN in situ, H₃O⁺ correctly represents the necessary acidic workup or proton source. NaHSO₃ is incorrect as it would form a bisulfite addition product, which is a different reaction pathway.\n    *   Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This process is known as hydrolysis.\n    *   **Conditions:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires harsh conditions, typically heating in the presence of a strong acid or a strong base.\n    *   **Reagent B:** We need a reagent that can catalyze this hydrolysis in the presence of water.\n        *   `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a standard reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles.\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (Acetic acid) is a weak acid and is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a stable nitrile to a carboxylic acid under typical conditions.\n    *   Therefore, a strong acid like **B = HCl** is the suitable reagent.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, A is H₃O⁺ and B is HCl.

The cyanide ion (CN⁻), from NaCN, acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n        `CH3-C(=O)-CH2CH3 + CN⁻ → CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2CH3`\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** The alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin. Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺).\n        `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2CH3 + H⁺ → CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2CH3`\n    *   **Evaluating Options for A:**\n        *   **H₃O⁺:** This represents an acidic aqueous solution (e.g., adding HCl or H₂SO₄ to water). It is a strong source of protons and is commonly used in an acidic workup step to protonate intermediates like the alkoxide formed here. This is a suitable choice for A.\n        *   **NaHSO₃:** Sodium bisulfite is a reagent that also adds to ketones, but it forms a bisulfite addition product, not a cyanohydrin. It is used for purification, not as a proton source in this context. Therefore, NaHSO₃ is not the correct reagent for A.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be **H₃O⁺**.

The reaction proceeds in two stages: first to an amide, and then the amide is further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid.\n        `R-C≡N + 2 H₂O --(catalyst)--> R-COOH + NH₃ (or NH₄⁺ in acid)`\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n    *   **Evaluating Options for B:**\n        *   **HCl:** Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid. Strong acids are effective catalysts for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. The reaction mixture would be acidic, yielding the carboxylic acid directly.\n        *   **CH₃COOH:** Acetic acid is a weak acid. While it can theoretically catalyze the reaction, the hydrolysis of nitriles requires harsh conditions (strong acid or strong base). A weak acid like acetic acid is generally not effective enough to drive the reaction to completion in a reasonable timeframe.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The most suitable catalyst for this transformation is a strong acid, **HCl**.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n    *   Comparing this with the given choices:\n        A) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH\n        B) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl\n        C) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH\n        D) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl\n    *   The correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   This reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone (butan-2-one).\n    *   The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.

The nucleophile, cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the C=O pi bond and forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n        2.  The negatively charged oxygen atom of the alkoxide intermediate is then protonated by a proton source to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin product.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be the proton source required for the second step of the mechanism. Looking at the options for A:\n        *   `NaHSO₃` (Sodium bisulfite): This reagent is used to form bisulfite addition products, which is a different reaction. It is not a proton source in the context of cyanohydrin formation.\n        *   `H₃O⁺` (Hydronium ion): This represents an acidic aqueous solution (e.g., dilute HCl or H₂SO₄). An acid is the perfect source of protons to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. While the reaction needs free CN⁻ and is often run under slightly acidic or buffered conditions (pH 4-5) to avoid protonating all the cyanide to HCN (a weaker nucleophile), an acid source (represented by H₃O⁺) is essential for the final protonation step.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be `H₃O⁺`. This eliminates options A and D. We are left with options B and C.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base, typically with heating.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is treated with a strong aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄, often represented as H₃O⁺) and heated.

This forms a carboxylate salt, which must then be treated with acid in a separate workup step to yield the final carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B, used with water (H₂O), acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis. Let's examine the options for B from the remaining choices (B and C):\n        *   `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid): This is a strong mineral acid. It is a standard and effective reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles.\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (Acetic acid): This is a weak organic acid.

A nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone (butan-2-one).\n    2.  **Mechanism:**\n        *   The cyanide ion, provided by NaCN, attacks the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        *   This breaks the C=O pi bond, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃`.\n        *   This negatively charged alkoxide ion needs to be protonated to form the final stable product, the cyanohydrin (which has a hydroxyl group, -OH).\n    3.  **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a proton source to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. In a laboratory setting, this is typically achieved by adding an acid. H₃O⁺ (the hydronium ion) is the general representation for an acid in an aqueous solution (like HCl or H₂SO₄ in water). While adding strong acid directly to NaCN is hazardous (produces toxic HCN gas), the reaction is often carried out by mixing the ketone and NaCN, and then slowly adding acid. Thus, H₃O⁺ represents the necessary acid for the protonation step. NaHSO₃ is used for forming bisulfite adducts, which is a different reaction.\n    4.  **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n    1.  **Reaction Type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).

The `CN-` ion attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a C-C bond and pushing the pi electrons from the C=O double bond onto the oxygen atom. This creates an alkoxide intermediate: `CH3-C(O-)(CN)-CH2-CH3`.\n        2.  This negatively charged alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (`-OH`) group. Reagent `A` must be a proton source.\n    *   Looking at the options for `A`:\n        *   `NaHSO3` (sodium bisulfite) is a salt and not a primary proton source in this context. While it can form addition products with ketones, it's not the reagent for this specific transformation.\n        *   `H3O+` represents an acidic aqueous solution (e.g., dilute HCl or H2SO4).

The product is a carboxylic acid, not a carboxylate salt, which suggests an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis or a base-catalyzed hydrolysis followed by an acidic workup. In acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, a strong acid is used to protonate the nitrile nitrogen, making the carbon more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water. The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as a catalyst for the hydrolysis. Strong acids like HCl or H₂SO₄ are very effective for this transformation, and the reaction is typically heated.

The reaction would be extremely slow or might stop at the intermediate amide stage.\n    *   Therefore, the suitable reagent for this complete hydrolysis is the strong acid, **B = HCl**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   For the first reaction, reagent **A** must be **H₃O⁺** for the acid workup step.\n*   For the second reaction, reagent **B** must be **HCl** to catalyze the nitrile hydrolysis.\n\nCombining these findings, we match them to the given options:\n*   A) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  (Incorrect)\n*   B) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl      (Incorrect)\n*   C) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl      (**Correct**)\n*   D) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH   (Incorrect)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\n*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   **Reactants:** butan-2-one (a ketone) and NaCN (a source of the nucleophile CN⁻).\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (a cyanohydrin).\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is a classic cyanohydrin formation reaction. It is a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group.\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This addition breaks the pi bond of the C=O group, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n        3.  This negatively charged alkoxide ion needs to be protonated to form the final stable product with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of reagent A:** Reagent A must be a proton source to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. A common way to achieve this is through an acidic workup. H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion, representing an aqueous acid like HCl or H₂SO₄) is the standard reagent for this protonation step. Therefore, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   Considering the options, NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfite) forms a different type of adduct with ketones and is incorrect for this synthesis. So, we can eliminate options B and D. We are left with options A and C.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   **Reactant:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The key functional group to consider is the nitrile group (-C≡N).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The nitrile group has been converted into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** This transformation is the hydrolysis of a nitrile. Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is typically heated with a strong aqueous mineral acid, such as HCl or H₂SO₄. The nitrile is first protonated, attacked by water, and eventually converted to a carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion.\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous base (e.g., NaOH), which initially forms a carboxylate salt. An acidic workup is then needed to protonate the carboxylate to get the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Role of reagent B:** Reagent B, along with water (H₂O), is the catalyst for this hydrolysis reaction to directly form the carboxylic acid.\n        *   Comparing the choices for B in the remaining options A and C:\n            *   **B = HCl (from option A):** Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and is a standard and effective reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles.\n            *   **B = CH₃COOH (from option C):** Acetic acid is a weak acid. While it might catalyze the reaction under harsh conditions (very long reaction times and high temperatures), it is not a typical or efficient reagent for nitrile hydrolysis. Strong acids are preferred.\n    *   Therefore, HCl is the most suitable reagent for B.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n    *   This combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the suitable reagents A and B for the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction starts with a ketone (butan-2-one) and a cyanide source (NaCN) and yields a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile). This is a classic **cyanohydrin formation** reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   Sodium cyanide (NaCN) dissociates in the solvent to provide the nucleophilic cyanide ion (⁻CN).\n    *   The cyanide ion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction.\n        `CH₃CH₂-CO-CH₃ + ⁻CN → CH₃CH₂-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₃` (This creates an alkoxide intermediate).\n    *   The negatively charged oxygen of the alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        `CH₃CH₂-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃CH₂-C(OH)(CN)-CH₃`\n    *   Therefore, reagent **A** must be a source of protons (H⁺).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options for A:**\n    *   **H₃O⁺:** This represents a strong acid in an aqueous solution (like HCl or H₂SO₄). It is a direct source of protons and is commonly used to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. While mixing NaCN and a strong acid directly can be hazardous due to the release of toxic HCN gas, the acid is often added slowly to the reaction mixture, or the H₃O⁺ simply denotes the proton source required to complete the reaction. It is a chemically correct choice for providing the necessary proton.\n    *   **NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfite):** This reagent typically adds to aldehydes and some ketones to form crystalline bisulfite adducts. It is used for purification, not as a proton source for cyanohydrin formation. It would compete with the cyanide ion. Thus, it is not the correct reagent for A.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be H₃O⁺.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the presence of water and reagent B. This is a **nitrile hydrolysis** reaction. The complex substituent \"2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxy...\" is just the 'R' group of the nitrile and does not participate in the core reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis requires a catalyst, which can be either an acid (H⁺) or a base (OH⁻), and usually requires heat. The overall reaction is:\n        `R-CN + 2 H₂O --(catalyst)--> R-COOH + NH₃` (or its protonated/deprotonated form depending on the pH).\n    *   Reagent **B** is the catalyst for this hydrolysis.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options for B:**\n    *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong acid. Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles is a standard and effective method. The strong acid protonates the nitrile nitrogen, making the carbon more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water. It is a very common reagent for this transformation.\n    *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid):** This is a weak acid. While technically an acid catalyst, it is much less effective than a strong mineral acid like HCl. Nitrile hydrolysis is often a sluggish reaction, and a weak acid like acetic acid would likely result in very low yield or require extremely harsh conditions (very high temperature and pressure). Therefore, HCl is the much more suitable reagent.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B is HCl.\n\n### **Final Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n*   Reagent B is HCl.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reagents, A and B.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction starts with a ketone (butan-2-one) and adds a cyanide group (-CN) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) to the carbonyl carbon. This is a classic example of **cyanohydrin formation**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   The cyanide ion (CN⁻), provided by sodium cyanide (NaCN), acts as a nucleophile. It attacks the partially positive carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   The pi bond of the carbonyl group (C=O) breaks, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, forming an alkoxide intermediate.\n        `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   This negatively charged alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated (gain an H⁺) to form the final neutral product, the cyanohydrin, which has a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃ + H⁺ ---> CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂CH₃` (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile)\n\n3.  **Determine the role and identity of reagent A:**\n    *   Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to complete the reaction.\n    *   Looking at the options for A:\n        *   `H₃O⁺`: This represents an acidic aqueous solution (like HCl or H₂SO₄ in water) and is an excellent source of protons. This is a suitable choice.\n        *   `NaHSO₃`: Sodium bisulfite is a reagent used to form bisulfite addition products with aldehydes and some ketones. It is not used to provide the proton in a cyanohydrin synthesis.\n    *   Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile functional group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This process is known as **nitrile hydrolysis**. The rest of the molecule (the large organic scaffold) remains unchanged.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis requires water (H₂O), which is indicated in the problem.\n    *   The reaction is typically very slow and must be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base. It often requires heating as well.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** In the presence of a strong acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄), the nitrile is protonated, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water. This proceeds through an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid and an ammonium salt.\n    *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** In the presence of a strong base (like NaOH), the hydroxide ion attacks the nitrile carbon. This also proceeds through an amide intermediate to form a carboxylate salt, which is then protonated in a final acidic workup step to yield the carboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **Determine the role and identity of reagent B:**\n    *   Reagent B must act as a catalyst for the hydrolysis of the nitrile.\n    *   Looking at the options for B:\n        *   `HCl`: Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and is a very common and effective catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis.

Let's verify the structure. Butan-2-one is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃. The reaction adds a -CN and a -H to the C=O double bond. The oxygen becomes -OH. The product is CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃. The IUPAC name for this structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which matches the product given.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction proceeds via nucleophilic addition of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone.\n        1.  `CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃ + CN⁻ ⇌ CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃` (tetrahedral intermediate/alkoxide)\n        2.  `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃` (product)\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** The second step requires a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the intermediate alkoxide.\n    *   **Evaluating options for A:**\n        *   `H₃O⁺`: This is an excellent source of protons. The reaction is often catalyzed by acid. A common procedure involves adding an acid like HCl or H₂SO₄ to a mixture of the ketone and NaCN. The acid provides H₃O⁺, which catalyzes the reaction and provides the necessary proton for the final step. While adding strong acid directly to NaCN can produce dangerous HCN gas, it's a standard representation for the required acidic conditions.\n        *   `NaHSO₃`: Sodium bisulfite reacts with ketones to form bisulfite addition products (`R₂C(OH)SO₃Na`). This is a separate reaction and would compete with, rather than facilitate, the cyanohydrin formation. Thus, NaHSO₃ is not the correct reagent 'A'.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be `H₃O⁺`.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Reactants:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile` (a cyanohydrin), reagent `B`, and `H₂O`.\n    *   **Product:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`. This is the corresponding α-hydroxy carboxylic acid. The reaction replaces the -CN group with a -COOH group, which is a characteristic nitrile hydrolysis.\n    *   **Conditions:** Nitrile hydrolysis is typically performed under strong acidic or strong basic conditions, usually with heating.\n        *   **Acidic Hydrolysis:** R-CN + 2 H₂O + H⁺ (catalyst) → R-COOH + NH₄⁺\n        *   **Basic Hydrolysis:** R-CN + OH⁻ (catalyst) + H₂O → R-COO⁻ + NH₃. An acid workup (H₃O⁺) is then needed to get the carboxylic acid R-COOH.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Since the product is the carboxylic acid directly (R-COOH) and not its salt (R-COO⁻), and water is a reactant, this points towards an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Reagent B is the acid catalyst.\n    *   **Evaluating options for B:**\n        *   `HCl`: Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid, commonly used to catalyze the hydrolysis of nitriles. Its presence provides the necessary H₃O⁺ ions in water to drive the reaction.\n        *   `CH₃COOH`: Acetic acid is a weak acid. While it can act as a proton source, it is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the hydrolysis of a stable nitrile to a carboxylic acid in a reasonable timeframe.
